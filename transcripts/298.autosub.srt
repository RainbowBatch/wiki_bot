Talk about our creator

3
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,040

00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:49,408
Fake an injury

10
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:58,624
Look at my

11
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:02,720
Or something

12
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:03,488
Blotter acid

13
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,120
If you don't

14
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,424
Most of the time that resolves itself

15
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,824
But I use that as an excuse not to play football

16
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:27,552
I was told that I would be on the line

17
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,392
Not going to run into

18
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:34,720
Does somebody over and over again

19
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:39,584
Part of the game I was interested player

20
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:40,608
I'm so high

21
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,888
Stop

22
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:45,472
Did you ever comedians have had

23
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:51,872
Meet up where they play softball or something

24
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:58,272
As bad as real bad

25
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:03,136
I never bowled in bowling alley with them

26
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,160
Because we would just get picture

27
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:10,560
And get really f***** up rulers rule

28
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,608
Close your frame

Team sports

31
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:30,016
Especially

32
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:36,416
Maybe I don't think we were as good a friend

33
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,768
Yeah that's playing with boys

34
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:44,864
Altos volleyball

35
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,168
After Chasing Sunsets

36
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:53,568

Powerball number January 20th

00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,112
Your 23rd 2013

41
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,416
Because I was

42
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,560
I just don't want to do it

43
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:21,216
I didn't I am not leaving

44
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,240
State of mind that is like

45
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,032
Can't do it

46
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,056
And I'm too

47
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:25,824
Curious

48
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,616
About what's going on with the

49
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,408
2013 investigation looking at

50
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,432

Sandy Hook

52
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,480
Especially after

53
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,760
Paul Joseph Watson

54
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,040
Send interviewed Professor James

55
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:37,600
On the last episode I was very

56
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,880
To see what would happen

57
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,160
Confirm that my curiosity

58
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:45,024
Do you want current date

59
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,376
Play where we talk

60
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,168
Talked about how all abortion should be

61
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,984
Yeah.

62
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,032
Oh I'm sure Alex is talking about that

63
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:59,104
I think there is some value to us covering that which is why

64
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:03,200
Present day

65
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:03,968
Decide

66
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,248
I did not

67
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,784
I watched a couple episodes

68
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:09,856
I don't think

69
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,136
I don't think it's a good

70
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,303
If not

71
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,375
Clear where we stand

72
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,655
Maybe we've done

73
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,423
Enough

74
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:27,775
Especially

75
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:33,151
Not sure get involved in social media

76
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,687
Pushing pushing

77
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,527
Publicly our support opposition

78
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:43,391
Absolutely

79
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,183
When we get back to the present day

80
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,207
It's not what is

81
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:46,975
Bother

82
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,511
Let's not worry about

83
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,047
So

84
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,583
Somebody

85
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,423
We had to get into thank you

86
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,471
People have signed up and are supporting the show

87
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:01,567
So first of all

88
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:10,015

89
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:10,783

Ewok

92
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:18,719
I'm a policy wonk

93
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:26,399
Donation bumped it up a little bit

94
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,751
But I have a new drop

95
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:34,847
This is the whole reason.

96
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:38,175
Thank you so much you are now a technocrat

97
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,455
The first

98
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,527
New drop

99
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:50,975
We got to go.

100
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,023
Heroin

101
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,863
Richardson bars

102
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:09,151
I'm not sure if that is as good as our old technocrat drop

103
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:12,223
Reviews come in

104
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:18,367
That's true

105
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,647
Respond to terrorists

106
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:23,743
But I do take

107
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:28,863

110
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,359
Alex

111
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,639
Something on the episode

112
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:44,479
That made me think that we're having an effect on his world

113
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,271
I'm not sure

114
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,855
But I think that we are responsible for this clip

115
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:52,415
This is one of the first times that I've heard Alex

116
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,695
Say something on the show

117
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,719
I don't think

118
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:58,047
Can have anything to do with anybody but off

119
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,095
If it's that this is a blue my mind

120
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,575
Jones

121
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:28,767
Imprison Weaver in

Alma Street

123
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,631
People walk

124
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,935
Prison for murder

125
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:04,351
Might be assertive strong version

126
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:08,703
Which I've never heard anybody but us

127
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:13,823
Not like a criticism comes up

128
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:20,223
I don't know right wing watch

129
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:33,791
I don't know if this has anything to do with us but it was one of the things

130
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,119
Seems very strange

131
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,703
The 20th

132
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,031
Is the 23rd of January

133
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,055
It happens in the

134
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,919
Track

135
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,943
Big narrative

136
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,223
Big things

137
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:52,991
We got to get into

138
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,527
I'm excited to do that

139
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,087
Here is an out-of-context drop

140
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:57,855
From Today Show

141
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,863
Rural America

142
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,423
Mostly right off the top

143
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,495
That is a Sunday

144
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,543
And so he just died

145
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:21,663

00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,967
Mike Adams

147
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,271
You just talked to that sheriff Danny payment

148
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:29,599
I got arrested the first time

149
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,047
So Mike Adams has him an interview

150
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,351
I talked to an author whose name is

151
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,399
Is Max velocity

152
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,959

153
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:51,615
Gun to my head I don't remember I couldn't tell you anything that he did

154
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:56,479
Videos about what is the max velocity of most

00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,111
Excuse.

157
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,183
January 21st

158
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,231
2013 was the day of Obama's second

159
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:07,999
Second inauguration

160
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:10,559
First inauguration

161
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,327
Alex left

162
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,375
Show to go get interviewed on Ark

163
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,399
For a little while

164
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,935
Second inauguration

165
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,007
For someone who's so committed

166
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,031
The fight against

167
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,311
The globalist and Obama

168
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,383
Ever be around on Tuesdays

169
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,919
Or be totally fine to just

170
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:30,783
The ship probably calculator

171
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,063
So he doesn't work

172
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:32,831
Himself up in

173
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,599
Too much of

174
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:38,207
My friends

175
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:38,975
Coincidence

176
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,535
You couldn't have known in advance like the popo

177
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,303
Wood step down

178
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:54,847

00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,383
Here is the

180
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,943
Clip Alex is getting a little bit

181
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,735
About people saying

182
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:03,295
But he doesn't know what he's talking about

183
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,903
Super smart

184
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:47,327
Coverage of Alex's documentary

185
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,863
Is really fun

186
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,143

I'm sure Alex

243
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:32,703
Terrible the way he flippantly said I'd let her whatever

244
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:41,151
I would point out about this

245
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:43,967
Wanted to draw

It just

257
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:10,591
People don't let it be a people on the right really don't like

00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:14,687
You know

260
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,711
And so they have

261
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,271
Undercut any other

262
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,295

President Reagan

277
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,751

00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,247
Alex was

282
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,015
Pretty

283
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:22,783
Focus

284
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,063

Piers Morgan

286
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,647

Call over the flu all over the entire set

288
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:38,143

He bested peers about every way

292
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:53,759
And

293
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:00,671
Used lightly let this drop a little bit here by the 22nd

294
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,719
He's kind of

295
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:04,511
He's moved on a little bit towards

296
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:11,167
Maybe you'll get invited Obamacare

297
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:14,495
Piers Morgan

298
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,359
What is fire

299
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,639
The Piers Morgan wants

300
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,431
The kill all the gun owners

301
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,967
And here's how Alex

302
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:41,631
Automatic

303
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:03,135
That was the clip that I was already played that but husband

304
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:03,903
Condemned to that

305
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:05,695
Stupidest thing

306
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,719
Anybody could have done

307
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:09,279
Listening to it again I do think she thought that

308
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,583
He meant like hitting him in the face with the

309
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,775
I don't know I I can't pretend to understand

310
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,311
Or know what someone is

311
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:26,943
Feel like she's responding to someone saying

312
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,223
Who killed X

313
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,063
No matter

314
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,855
How much I disagree with him about everything

315
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:34,879
He's right

316
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,927
Except someone talk

317
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,487
Think about him like that especially on National Television

318
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,303
Unfortunately

319
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,359
Trinity

320
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,743
What I do is I replace the saucers of the machine gun

321
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:17,375
I'm just leaving the place to publish

322
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:20,191
I'm just typing

323
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,471
Text Alex

324
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:57,311
New clip of Piers Morgan talking about shooting people and

325
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,079
Play

326
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:00,127
Over and over and over again

327
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:04,479
And he says that it's about shooting gun owners Michigan

328
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:08,831
So in this next clip he plays the clip again just says it a little bit more

329
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:12,927
I am because he played it so many times

330
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:13,695
Care but

331
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,487
Because he played it so many times has started

332
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:21,631
To notice what was actually being talked about pick out the names that are disgusting

333
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:26,751
The situation the interviewer is acting explain it all to you

334
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:29,311
And it has nothing to do with it

335
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,143

I'm just

340
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,792
Just replace the Buzzard with the machine gun

341
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,120
Always fantasizing about shooting

342
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,400
Alright so are you

343
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,728
Get what's going on here

344
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,056
Clarkson on

345
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,336
Britain's Got Talent

346
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:38,944
Some of the important details but Alex is praying his audience

347
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,248
Can't make out

348
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:50,208
Thing that everybody would say

349
00:21:55,328 --> 00:22:01,216
Misrepresenting

350
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:01,984
I'm just at

351
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:06,336
Barely listening to the coil it's obvious

352
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:09,664
The first indication of that is that the interviews a bus

353
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,968
People imagine what he would rate them

354
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:17,344
Contestants on Britain's Got Talent the show the Piers Morgan was one of the judges on for the first four seasons

355
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,904
Which is why it's relevant to ask that question

356
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:25,024
Clarkson which as you were able to stop doubting the reference

357
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,816
Tucson journalist Jeremy Clark

00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:28,352

Refute

365
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,688
Some of this dates back to

A is the editor of the daily

Sort of Heaven

371
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,904
Comstock to dig up dirt on him

372
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,488
Being a Clarkson with a direct competitor in the mirror was

373
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,024
Bad shape financially

374
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,840
Unhappy about that treatment Clarkson portal

375
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:02,400
Glass of water on Piers when he ran into

376
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:06,496
What's

377
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,056
Reminder but there's no hero in this story

378
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:13,664
2004 British ceremony

379
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,200
We're a fairly drunk Clarkson

380
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:19,808
An approach that you're in my world I can tell you your

381
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:25,184
The guardian reports

382
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:30,048
Reports about what happened next

383
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,328
Apparently Clarkston

384
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:35,168
Quote claims Morgan slighted his wife

385
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,216
Which is a very British way to phrase

386
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:39,520
Carson started

387
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:41,056
Apparently connecting at least

388
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,592
Go to shop

389
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,872
Put his keys in a bowl

390
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:46,176
Skidmore

391
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:49,760
Here's unfazed gal is that all you got

392
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,040
It turned out it wasn't

393
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:59,232
Tears would tell the guardian quote

394
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,024
Let me present my nose by about an inch

395
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:06,400
Later. Would say quote I frankly taken worst beatings from my three-year-old son

396
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:09,728
Now that's a better life

397
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,824
Stryker

398
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,016
Is just one in a long line

399
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,552
We'll have to kiss and make-up

400
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:27,136
However later he was spotted in Windows on the world

401
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:32,000
The bar telling people that he did it all for Britain

402
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:39,936
In 2015 with Piers announcing the

403
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:41,984
Quotes

404
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:45,568
Clarkson

405
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,336
Quote

406
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:49,664
I'm going through a difficult

407
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,968
I'm going through a difficult divorce

408
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:55,040
My first ex-wife is also come out of the woodwork to give me how

409
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:57,600
I'm smoking too much drinking too much my back hurts

410
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,648
I'm all over the papers with this n words

411
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:05,536
Scandal I'm at war with the BBC bosses and my mother has just died I simply don't have the energy for you anymore

412
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,888
On an episode of Top Gear

413
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,680
Two cars Clarkson did the old

414
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:13,216
Eenie meenie miney mo

415
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:17,568
Expect

416
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:20,384
I got a little bit of water about that

417
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,456
The desire to shoot that Jeremy Clarkson has nothing to do with gun

418
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,016
Forgot

419
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:26,784
Anything like that

420
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:30,368
The second person that was listed by the interviewer

421
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:33,696
The contested does hypothetical episode of Britain's Got Talent is

422
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,464
20

423
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,232
Which is a referee

424
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,256
Prince2

425
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,304
Trini appeared as a contestant on The

426
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,376
2007 season of comic relief does The Apprentice

427
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,912
The UK version

428
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,704
Comic relief charity

429
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,800
UK version of Vape through the celebrity of run

430
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,920
A gun to a bit of a famous fight

431
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:54,688
On the show

432
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:57,760
On the episode each team was supposed to get a chef assigned

433
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:58,528
To them that would help

434
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:00,064
Complete their mission for the episode

435
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:03,136
The chef for the girls team accidentally showed up at the boys

436
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:07,232
Who decided instead of sending him where he's supposed to go they would lock him up in their bathroom

437
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:10,560
Do you want to try and sort this out but an argument broke out and things

438
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:11,584
A little bit

439
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:14,400
If you watch the actual video to show the whole thing

440
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,168
Began as a

441
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:15,936
Obviously

442
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:17,216
Contrived in manufacturer

443
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:20,032
The drama but it appears

444
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,056
A and Trinity

445
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:24,384
Who was quite a bit in the media about how she ended up crying

446
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:28,480
This sort of fight went a long way toward solidifying

447
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:29,504
A is reputation

448
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,528
Is being a complete

449
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:39,488
Later on was what part of is Brandel

450
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:44,352
This escalated

451
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,120
He cry

452
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,448
It said into that ugly

453
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:50,240
So I'm sure he doesn't look back

454
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,776
At that interaction with

455
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,336
Him joking about shooting her head nothing

456
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:56,128
Things to do with her supporting guns either

457
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,944
The interviewers ask hypothetical question about the

458
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,736
Two people doing an act on Britain's Got

459
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:04,064
He suggests Clarkson would be going on about his green card

460
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:09,440
Because Clarkson was a big enemy of the green movement

461
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,464
Cnv lesbian

462
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:14,560
Treaty would talk about what everyone is wearing because she was the host of whatnot

463
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:16,096
To wear for its first five season

464
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:18,144
The clip has nothing to do with gun

465
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,704
Morgan's high-profile to YouTube

466
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,472
UK

467
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,008
I grant that the joke that he's making

468
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,288
Incredibly poor taste

469
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,056
No probably

470
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,080
Critiquing for that

471
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:29,920
Brazen

472
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,200
Active intellectual dishonesty

473
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,736
Alex's Thompson

474
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,272
You can pass it off because his audience

475
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:39,648
Carefully listen to that and they'll just assume Clarkson and Trini are gun lovers in the UK or so

476
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:42,208
It's our operating from a sin

477
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:42,976
See your position

478
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:45,792
You would never try to pass off this kind of manipulation

479
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:46,560
His audience

480
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:47,328
This is

481
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,096
Deeply

482
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,376
Intention

483
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,400
You know it

484
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,448
Weird because it is

485
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,496
Contacts

486
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,616
Not necessarily taking it out of context

487
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:04,736
But because you don't know because the average American has no idea what the

488
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,440
Like no British celebrities

489
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,144
You know

490
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,192
It doesn't

491
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:26,752
The X-Men

492
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:27,776
It will be a problem

493
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,616
Delta Spirit be like

494
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,896
He does say that he wants

495
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,688
To shoot people on Britain's Got Talent

496
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:39,296
That must be what at least

497
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:44,160
Also he got the quote

498
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:46,976
Said he love you

499
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:51,840
Like whenever he plays it again I see it almost on one of

500
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:52,864
Documentaries

501
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,424
Got the full body shot of him saying

502
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:01,568
Zooms in and crops out

503
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:04,896
Step total

504
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:07,456
It's a classic Alex

505
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:10,528
For sure

506
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:12,832
We can still go fly a kite

507
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:19,232
Give me all of that tricks probably the only one who's probably I don't know enough about her I have no idea

508
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:25,888
She is like as a person or even as a celebrity I just know that Piers Morgan made her cry

509
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:28,704
Jeremy Clarkson a Morgan

510
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:29,728
Groza

511
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:33,056
I'm more sympathetic but also with the caveat that

512
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,080
She might have

513
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:40,480
Terrible skeleton Arrow

514
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,528
Go watch your girlfriend

515
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,904
Discusses how Soviet Russian Nazi

516
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,928
Germany mix

517
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:49,952
Is coming

518
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:52,256
Depression that represent

519
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,024
Santa's coming

520
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,584
And then we get to see what it looked like

521
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,352
2013

522
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,496
German

523
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:04,544
Incredible

524
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:08,384
I do I do

525
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,992
T-shirts

526
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,040
Fine

527
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,344
Normal

528
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,392
That's what you would expect unlike NPR's

529
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:22,976
Sort of

530
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:27,840
Sophia depression is coming please for the sponsors

531
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:32,448
Evocative thing and then add

532
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,008
Character

533
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:35,776
But he's not

534
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,824
Getting people whipped into a frenzy

535
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,848
The same way he does

536
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,432
Differences

537
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:47,040
What similarities Bulbasaur

538
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:55,488
Whatever the Pokemon evolution figure

539
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:58,048
Charizard

540
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:03,680
Sears art actually whatever

541
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:07,264
Did you ever

542
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:13,920
It was

543
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:17,248
Obviously he is still doing his whip people up into a frenzy

544
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,016
But it was

545
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,064
In regards

546
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,088
News stories

547
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,624
Soffer NPR

548
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,392
Sing along the lines

549
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,464
Is Alabama's abortion law is the most

550
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,488
Draconian

551
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:28,256
History

552
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,280
This

553
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:33,888
Channel is the 49er with

554
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:34,912
Separate them

555
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:35,936
With a bed of music

556
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:40,544
They would probably throw in some weird folk songs

557
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:47,200
MP3 world music

558
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:50,528
Two comes in

559
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,320
It's our boy Max Keiser

560
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:58,208
Couch to Max Queens

561
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,256
The Great

562
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,560
He doesn't have that interests

563
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,888
But out of his own volition

564
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:06,656
Let's

565
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:10,240
Something happens

566
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,264
Becoming very

567
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:15,616
He's just pictured around

568
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,152
Because of that

569
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:20,736
Probably really interested in playing

570
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,040
Cancel predictions

571
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:28,928
Between now and April as I predicted

572
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:35,584
I might be wrong but I won't be wrong

573
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,360
Taken

574
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:49,152
So

575
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,432
You think about their prediction

576
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:54,016
Pennywise

577
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,552
He's not entirely wrong

578
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:58,112
Bond market collapse

579
00:32:59,136 --> 00:32:59,648
2013

580
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:02,208
There was a very large cell

581
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:05,024
May 2013 which is close enough

582
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:07,584
Forgiving him kind of partial credit for that predict

583
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:12,448
Yeah I would take that a couple weeks

584
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:17,056
The sell-off was the result of the Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke

585
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,848
To taper off quantitative easing

586
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:19,872
Slow down

587
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,176
It's worth noting that Alex in his gas

588
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:24,736
Constantly call on the feds and quantitative

589
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:29,344
Exactly what they do a downturn in the market

590
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:35,744
Market by the falls

591
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:41,120
Ultimately I fail to believe that Alex or Mac really care too much about the health of the bond market

592
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:44,192
Considering it immediately after Trump won the 2016 election

593
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:48,800
The bond market crash to the tune of the loss of $1000000

594
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:53,664
That situation

595
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:56,736
This prediction by Max Keiser is not really a psychic predicts

596
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,344
I was going to make this move around that time or 2013

597
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,328
Probably could have guessed that there were significant

598
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,864
He's being a little bit more

599
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,912
Sensational that he needs to be possibly but he's

600
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:15,680
Not as

601
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:19,008
He's not being as irresponsible as a lot of viruses

602
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,800
Yeah and the financials

603
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:26,688
I'm talking about the common market trouble and services that second part

604
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:28,224
The gold is going to go up

605
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:29,760
And let me tell you Jordan

606
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,296
It did not

607
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,320
Max

608
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:35,136
It is explicit prediction that it was going

609
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:36,160
To go up because of

610
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,952
The downturn in the market

611
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:38,976
The bond market

612
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,000
Did go down

613
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,536
More or less as he predicted

614
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,632
1800

615
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:47,424
$3.75

616
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,192
4 oz

617
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:50,240
Hannah Davis episode was up to

618
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,008
1690

619
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:51,776
82 + 30

620
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:52,800
2 cents per ounce

621
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:55,360
Market sell-off

622
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:59,456
The price was down to 1470 dollars in $0.44

623
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,272
And if we continue dropping for the rest of the day

624
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,808
You're ending on New Year's Eve

625
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,344
1000

626
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,136
205 dollars in 40

627
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,720
Great representing and approximately 27

628
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:11,744
Set drop in value

629
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:15,584
Gourmet the slight uptick in 2014 but it never reached 40

630
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,352
1809

631
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:20,704
Gear down at 1181.

632
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:25,056
Gold spec 2015 barely above $1,000 an ounce

633
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:27,872
60 dollars in 80s

634
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:30,176
So for the next

635
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,200
2 years

636
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,480
After the school did not

637
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:34,016
Go up very high

638
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:34,784
And it's spelled

639
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:39,136
What may be a little bit more

640
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,160
Give or take it out

641
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,440
That's not good

642
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:44,768
Max's prediction about the bond market Services strength

643
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:48,352
Their appeals for Their audience to bike

644
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,632
Speculative advice

645
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:53,216
If this weren't a show being syndicated by a gold sales company

646
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,752
These sorts of conversation

647
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:58,080
They would be a bit more suspicious

648
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:02,432
If they weren't immediately followed by a commercial for Midas resources

649
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:04,992
Which it is as soon as they go to break

650
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:07,808
Anderson has a commercial for Midas resources

651
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:08,832
So all of this

652
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:09,600
Has to be

653
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:10,880
Proceed with M that

654
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:13,440
Larger context than that

655
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:16,256
Intentional model

656
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:18,560
Simple

657
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:20,096
Call the action in the book

658
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,936
Next thing you know

659
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:25,728
Guess who's selling gold

660
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:28,800
But the thing that I find more interesting about it is

661
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:30,848
Terms of

662
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:31,616
The financial

663
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:33,408
People that I've seen on our to the show

664
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,200
The closest to having

665
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,736
Not

666
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:37,504
Crazy

667
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,040
Set up

668
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:43,136
The other people have pretty insane

669
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:43,904
Yeah

670
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,256
First stages that get to the gold kind of like

671
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,048
Post Harbour

672
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,328
Close

673
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:54,144
It's all around

674
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,448
Because something happens breaking news

675
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,216
Well

676
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:58,752
In the middle of interviewing Mac

677
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:03,104
Will not stop interrupting my

678
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:05,664
I don't know

679
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,248
Irrelevant

680
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,272
Compared to a lot of

681
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:24,096
What's up with the word

682
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,632
Kind of funny

683
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:31,776
Decently clever of him to me for me to get that kind of

684
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:34,336
Depression because they're also kind of boring

685
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:37,664
Cleverness is

686
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,504
Contextually fairly boring whenever I hear him coming up on it

687
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,552
Fat guys are coming up

688
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:44,832
Poopy doopy

689
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:49,184
Realized

690
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:52,768
Yeah that's what

691
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,352
I only get excited when a monster

692
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,008
Of course

693
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:04,544
News

694
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,568
Here's what it is

695
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,064
Lone Star College in Houston

696
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:17,856
So Alex has eggs

697
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:21,440
No I predicted

698
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,720
That

699
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:26,560
After Alex recognized the popularity of these

700
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,328
YouTube

701
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:31,168
Videos about

702
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:31,936
10.6

703
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:32,960
Million views

704
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:34,496
Days on this YouTube video

705
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:36,288
We got to get into this business

706
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:39,104
Paul Joseph Watson interviews James

707
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,384
I had a strong

708
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,664
Suspicion that there was going

709
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,432
Tubi

710
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:48,064
And I believe that the way Alex of covering the shooting at the Lone Star College

711
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,088
In Texas

712
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:50,112
Is

713
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,928
Pretty strong example of

714
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,744
So is he going to go straight

715
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:56,768
Crisis actor

716
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,840
Initiative

717
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,168
Shift that there's something

718
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:08,800
Covering the shooting not broadcasting everything live

719
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,080
For the world to see

720
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:11,872
Because there's a cover-up going on

721
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:14,432
Urns are lessened because

722
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,784
The people on the

723
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:21,344
So Alex

724
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,136
Insists that he is going to

725
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,160
Play the

726
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,440
Stream

727
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,976
From the local news

728
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:31,584
Channel

729
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:34,144
So here is covering this

730
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:34,912
I will get into

731
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:36,448
What's going on

732
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:38,240
It's busy

733
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:45,664
Recorded

734
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:27,392
So Alex is basically pitching The Narrative that this is covering it out by

735
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:29,952
To do the work

736
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:32,256
They refuse to do

737
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,024
The Houston

738
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,816
KHOU

739
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,352
Feed

740
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,632
Infuriated

741
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:44,288
It doesn't matter super transparent

742
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,056
Sandy Hook

743
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,848
Video call to go through

744
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:47,616
Video

745
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:50,688
Is so popular that there's a huge market for it

746
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:53,504
The claim that space early with this next

747
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:56,576
Business is the next one after he

748
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:59,136
Realizes that market share

749
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:01,184
So that's the most

750
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,232
Capitalistic thing

751
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:06,816
Like he's already

752
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:07,840
Plotting it advanced

753
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:09,632
How he's going to make money off of

754
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,912
The next school shooting

755
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:12,704
That his rhetoric makes

756
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,472
Renders

757
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,240
Inevitable

758
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:15,776
He would probably call it

759
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:16,544
Coverage

760
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:18,592
Sure you would call it making money

761
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:21,152
Potato potahto

762
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:23,200
The next

763
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:26,016
Kia is going to live coverage

764
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,552
CNN Warriors

765
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,768
Students are not right

766
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:37,536
YES Prep

767
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,352
Basically

768
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:42,912
128

769
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:43,680
And

770
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,336
Fart

771
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:55,199
Disposition is pretty clear

772
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:59,807
Where he's coming from

773
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:02,623
Is very irrelevant apparently because we are not listening

774
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:05,951
We're just hearing

775
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,279
By Design

776
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:16,191
All the way down back here on the other side

777
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:18,239
That's pretty gross

778
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,007
Wow

779
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:26,431
So on January 22nd 2013 there was a shooting on the Campus of Lone Star College

780
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:28,223
Community College in Harris County

781
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,783
Incorporated area outside

782
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:36,671
The shooting was the result of an argument between Foster and another student

783
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:40,511
People were hospitalized

784
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:41,535
Including

785
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,071
Someone who is

786
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:45,887
There's a second person

787
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:48,447
The name Carlton Berry

788
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:51,519
Later because he wasn't

789
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:57,663
However after the police press charges he admitted that he was there

790
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:00,735
The police defended arresting Barry and charging

791
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:05,343
Because quote Barry Foster might not have been arrested

792
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,879
Recover

793
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:09,439
The police were real insistent they done.

794
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:11,743
Wrong with a sheriff

795
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:16,607
French

796
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:20,703
Did nothing wrong

797
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:22,495
It's a red front

798
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:24,031
The sheriff went to a forest

799
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:26,335
To demand an apology from the local news channel

800
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:30,175
Recovering his own press conference where he showed off Barry's mugshot

801
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:33,503
And said quote if we can make an example out of anyone we will

802
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:35,039
I hope he gets what he deserves

803
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,063
To putting others in harm

804
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:41,439
Basically the apology from school

805
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:44,511
The distinction that this happened at a college

806
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:46,047
And also that it was a shooting

807
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,839
It happened at a school

808
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:49,119
Not a school shooting

809
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:51,935
Yoda meme

810
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:54,239
That distinction it's still a terrible

811
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:55,263
Disaster

812
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:57,055
But I do think that technical difference

813
00:43:57,567 --> 00:44:00,383
Between an argument escalated into a shooting

814
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:01,663
It's the one setting out to

815
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:03,967
The shoe people at a college or any other school

816
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:04,991
Our differences

817
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:06,527
Okay so this was

818
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:08,831
Because it God I wish

819
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:09,855
I wish I didn't

820
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:12,415
I have to say that I don't remember

821
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,999
But we live in a world where they all

822
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:20,095
Yeah this one was a

823
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:22,655
Person to person

824
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:29,311
I've got guns and I'm taking about the

825
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,079
The school day

826
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:33,151
Information

827
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:34,175
And he's barely listen

828
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:35,199
These Witnesses

829
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,991
They're being covered by cage

830
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:40,063
Show you his intentions

831
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:40,831
From the first second

832
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:41,855
He's talking about this story

833
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:44,415
He's convinced that with Sandy Hook the globalist

834
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:46,207
Slipped up and accidentally

835
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:48,255
The gunmen were in the woods and all that s***

836
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:50,303
Alex is saying that they're not going to be

837
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:51,583
So sloppy this time

838
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,631
Which is why he's making a big deal out of the Tiger

839
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:55,935
CNN live streaming coverage of the school

840
00:44:56,703 --> 00:45:02,847
The fact without knowing any of the details he covers this breaking story this way is all the proof you need to know

841
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:03,615
Motivation

842
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:06,431
Proof shooting

843
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:07,711
Did Sandy Hook was fake

844
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:09,759
This story is a prop to him

845
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:12,575
From the job to help justify his own coverage

846
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,903
Eventually

847
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:16,927
Of Sandy Hook

848
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:27,679
Right and so unresponsive

849
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:28,703
And they were like

850
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:31,007
We're going to do responsible reporting

851
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:33,055
F****** up his evidence of a

852
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:33,823
Conspiracy

853
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,639
Responsible reporting is evidence of a

854
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:39,199
Thing you can do

855
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:40,991
Also I need to mention this

856
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:43,807
In researching the story I couldn't help but notice

857
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,087
Trend

858
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:49,183
But the shooter in the victim in this case were both black

859
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:51,999
Generally when I read about one of these shootings

860
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:54,815
The criminal past of the shooter is discussed

861
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:55,583
Wasn't

862
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:58,143
Really weird

863
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,167
Also

864
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,983
Interested in covering the criminal past of the victim Jody

865
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:05,055
To Houston quotes

866
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:11,967
Bo also has a criminal history he was convicted of unauthorized use of a motor vehicle in 2004 in possession of a switchblade

867
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:12,735
Knuckles

868
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:14,271
Assaulted

869
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:15,039
2010

870
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:21,439
Fake news I don't have to care about him anymore because

871
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,975
Record

872
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:29,375
It's really wild this is only part of the story because he was shot but the media felt it some

873
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:31,679
Help flush out the story to discuss his arrest

874
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:36,031
I cannot think of another time when I've been reading media coverage of other shootings

875
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:38,079
Where this sort of coverage is applied

876
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:40,383
And I've read a lot of stories about you

877
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,407
Preparations

878
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:49,343
The only other times I can think of her of course other hope high profile

879
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,623
The police

880
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:51,391
It's

881
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:52,927
Not

882
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:57,791
It's not an illusion how many times do we have to see a white shoe

883
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:59,583
Fuk up

884
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:05,983
30 goddamn people and then the news shows a picture of him playing f****** football in his backyard

885
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:08,287
And a black

886
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:14,687
Get these f****** mugshot put up f*** off a 2018 study out of Ohio State University founded

887
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:16,223
White Mass Shooters are 95

888
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:20,319
More likely to be described as mentally ill as opposed to

889
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:24,159
Media coverage of 219 attack

890
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:25,183
Text to reach this conclusion

891
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:30,047
Quotes much of the media coverage of white Shooters frame them as sympathetic characters who were suffering

892
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:31,071
From extreme life circle

893
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:36,447
Shooters were usually made

894
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,983
To seem dangerous animatics

895
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:38,751
Society

896
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:41,567
It's pretty awful that this bias is so Stark one discuss

897
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:42,847
Just got the perpetrator

898
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:44,895
What is completely insane

899
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:46,687
Defeatist directed towards victim

900
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:49,503
And I find it very hard to ignore that racial element

901
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:50,271
Considering

902
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:51,295
Countless stories

903
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:52,575
About white victims Bash

904
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:54,111
Over the course of

905
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,903
Sofa

906
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:57,951
This is not an isolated case

907
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:59,999
In a 2017 article on the Huffington

908
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:02,047
Composed which is an updating original

909
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:03,583
Publisher 2014

910
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:07,935
Headlines regarding stories of white Shooters and black

911
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:09,471
And he is very

912
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:12,031
Highlights media often response

913
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:15,103
Dwight Shooters around of

If it's good person could do some

915
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:17,407
Something so bad

916
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:19,455
Meanwhile headlines cover in Black

917
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:20,223
Victims

Of murder

919
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:24,575
Highlight how the guy wasn't really that good of a guy and probably a crimp

920
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:26,623
Shouldn't worry too much about that got shot

921
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:31,999
To begin with

922
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:36,607
In high school but let me tell you something

923
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:37,631
GPS

924
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:43,775
Who's the real victim super f***** up and I don't know what else to say about it other than that

925
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:45,311
Alex

Father's not going to help them

930
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:59,903
Alex has a story

About young girl

Pennsylvania

933
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:04,511
You got suspended for

934
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:05,535
For having a bubble gun

935
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:07,583
Little Hello Kitty

936

Kitty bubblegum

937

But yeah

945
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,279
This is the kind of

946
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:10,559
Big stories that Alex

947
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:14,655
Who's been going on about it this time frame I haven't really touched it yet cuz I

948
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:15,423
Kind of thought it was

949
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:18,495
To be a flash in the pan

950
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:19,263
Going to go away

951
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:21,055
Is Aristotle

952
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:22,847
Stupid

Child in Mount Carmel Pennsylvania

954
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:36,415
But the issue wasn't that she had a Hello Kitty bubble gum

955
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:40,255
Not really she was threatening to shoot others

956
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:46,143
What's the school that was in violation of their zero-tolerance policy

957
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:47,935
I'll probably say that this is a little

958
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:51,519
I understand the reason but I think the sort of situation

959
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:53,311
Who won the probably calls for some

960
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,335
Creative thinking

961
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:56,895
Probably the best response would be to not make the

962
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:58,175
Child's your other door

963
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:58,943
Excluded like

964
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:03,551
But to provide them with some kind of a setting where the parents can

965
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:07,135
Disgusted is really inappropriate

966
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:13,279
Yeah whatever my feelings on the matter are I'm not a school administrator and I've never really talked to a five-year-old so my opinion

967
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:15,839
Is useless take it with a grain of salt

968
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:17,375
Doesn't matter

969
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:20,191
On January 30th the school district overturn the suspension

970
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:23,519
Charles record

971
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:27,871
It makes it easier for the mother to get the

972
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:29,151
Suspension overturned

973
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:34,015
Since she was a former cop and had multiple lawyers with her at a closed-door meeting where they discussed

974
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:39,903
The suspension to get over there and under a staff

975
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:40,671
Undertale

976
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:41,439
Somebody trying

977
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:47,071
The meeting was closed to the Press so we may never know exactly what happened within it but

978
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:49,119
Kind of feels like it was about suing the school.

979
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:51,935
Since it's her lawyer announced after the suspension

980
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:53,727
It was erased that there would be no loss

981
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:54,751
Surprise

982
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:57,823
It also is worth noting that the child's mother when interviewed after

983
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:01,407
The suspension was overturned

984
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:02,943
Email the school administration

985
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:06,783
This is almost certainly result of media like Alex covering a case

986
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:08,831
Because otherwise why would someone outside

987
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:12,159
Care about a five-year-old getting it possibly slightly too

988
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:13,183
Punishments in her

989
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:14,207
Kindergarten class

990
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:15,487
Who cares

991
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:18,303
Multiple stories

992
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,583
Infowars.com

993
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:22,399
And it's come up a bunch of times on the radio show that I've been listen

994
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:25,983
Does any story pointing out that this

995
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:27,263
Suspension was overturned

996
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:33,407
Another stories with no clarification that

997
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:35,455
Or any charges of terroristic threatening

998
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:38,271
If you're a journalism Outlet that's pretty important

999
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:39,295
As clarification

1000
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:41,087
Yeah I would see

1001
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:48,767
You know what I was

1002
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:51,071
Cowboys and Indians

1003
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:57,727
Young Generation that's off babies is right

1004
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:03,871
A journalism outlet with post clarification

1005
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:05,407
Something

1006
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:06,687
Come on

1007
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:10,271
We've learned over and over

1008
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:16,671
Hey Dad how do I

1009
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:17,951
Compare coverage

1010
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:21,279
Of similar circumstances where the person they're talking about

1011
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:29,727
What are the clearest examples of in for double standard as it relates to cover the case of Ahmed Mohamed

1012
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:33,311
He built a clock

1013
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:36,383
Showcase there's teachers. Receptive

1014
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:38,687
Infowars

1015
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:43,039
Distantly refers to Ahmed as quote clock boy or clock kid

1016
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:45,087
Variation

1017
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:48,415
Yeah

1018
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:54,559
I don't know

1019
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:57,375
Quotev

1020
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:59,167
Jesus and all the coverage

1021
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:00,703
To take his proven

1022
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:02,751
That Ahmed was engaged in the house

1023
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:03,519
Right

1024
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:05,567
On September 22nd 2015

1025
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:08,127
Watson Road in article with the headline quote

1026
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:08,895
Judge

1027
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:12,991
Klockit family could be charged with fraud

1028
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:13,759
Purposeful hoax

1029
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:16,575
Implied

1030
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:17,599
The case about the child

1031
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:21,951
Fox News hosts

1032
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:23,743
The sub headline to the story is

1033
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:28,351
Quotes on false premise

1034
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:32,447
The problem here is that the full quote from Napolitano

1035
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:37,311
If the parents were involved in a hoax now you have a fraud going because money has been collected on.

1036
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:38,079
Pretenses

1037
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:40,639
Is eating of itself

1038
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:41,663
A frog

1039
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:44,991
It removes the conditional aspect of beginning of the Santa

1040
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:46,527
Which depended

1041
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:51,647
Go to

1042
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:52,415
Urban the same

1043
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:54,719
Infowars went out of its way to post

1044
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:58,815
The story the packing Ahmed framing the situation is an elaborate hoax to make it look like

1045
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:03,423
Islamophobia is an actual problem.

1046
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:06,239
Of course he'll tell you that the population

1047
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:08,031
It is more than 10% Muslim

1048
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:09,567
Bible Hub

1049
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:14,687
That's Islam a reasonable

1050
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:16,735
If you're keeping score

1051
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:17,759
Suspended for threatening

1052
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:18,527
Classmates

1053
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:19,551
The fake on it

1054
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:20,319
Huge deal

1055
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:21,087
We need to take

1056
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:21,855
Is very serious

1057
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:25,439
A child named Mohammed gets taken into custody for bringing the

1058
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:27,999
The clock people thought was a bomb to school without ever

1059
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:34,399
It's an elaborate ruse to defraud people and caused racism against white people

1060
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:35,167
Perfect sense

1061
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:40,543
You see how this works yeah a lot of fourteen-year-olds thinking on the third dimension

1062
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:43,615
Situation

1063
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:46,687
Important

1064
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:48,223
Keep in mind as the coverage of

1065
00:55:57,951 --> 00:56:00,767
Hours of Moraine 2 Guns

1066
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:06,399
Alex gets back to covering this

1067
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:07,423
Texas shooting

1068
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:12,031
He's almost salivating

1069
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,847
To get this coverage

1070
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:15,871
Wilshire

1071
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:16,639
False flag

1072
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:19,455
Or at least yourself

1073
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:25,087
It was a friend

1074
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:29,951
And

1075
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:31,999
Class

1076
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:38,911
What happened was that

1077
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:43,007
Calculus

1078
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:43,775
Computers

1079
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:47,871
And causing just in case

1080
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:50,687
And we was at 4

1081
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:52,479
And of course we start here in the

1082
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:54,783
Helicopter

1083
00:56:58,367 --> 00:56:59,903
So we found out FedEx

1084
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:03,743
Somebody else

1085
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:10,143
So because someone came in your classroom

1086
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:11,935
That was all

1087
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:16,799
I think I've ever heard

1088
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:17,823
You can tell

1089
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:23,967
Is a little disappointed I'm not sure if he came out in that clip you listen to the entire thing

1090
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:25,759
There's a sense of deflation

1091
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:27,039
Anna comes over at 10

1092
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:28,319
He keeps going back

1093
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:30,111
To the yeah

1094
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:33,183
Next clip I think

1095
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:34,463
He finally reaches

1096
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:35,231
The end of his rope

1097
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:48,287
Got to find out what the latest and greatest information

1098
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:54,687
Far as the official for a walk over here

1099
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:00,063
Believe we do know at this point

1100
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:01,343
Is that

1101
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:07,487
Before she was pulled away to get the latest information I did learn that the person that they do have in custody

1102
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:11,071
Sure if that person is actually a shooter

1103
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:27,711
Texas realize that all of the people that are being interviewed or black

1104
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:30,271
I think that there is a

1105
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:32,063
I get a strong sense

1106
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:34,879
That he pivots the narratives

1107
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:36,671
The people that are being

1108
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:37,439
Interview

1109
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:43,839
Well it could be a false

1110
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:46,399
You cannot care about it and push this to the side

1111
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:52,799
Cuz he doesn't talk about it anymore for the rest of the show he goes to overdrive does an extra half-hour he doesn't go back

1112
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:53,567
Back to the feed

1113
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:59,967
On the 23rd of January which doesn't talk about the shooting anymore

1114
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:03,551
Eagerness to be like

1115
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:05,087
The next

1116
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:06,879
And I'm going to be on the ground

1117
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:09,439
Getting the information that others will

1118
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:10,975
To make the super

1119
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:13,279
Popular profitable

1120
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:14,303
Videos

1121
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:17,631
And it's not that and as it goes along he realizes

1122
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:19,167
Suck it

1123
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:21,983
And he just found it's disgraceful I think it's

1124
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:23,263
If you conceived

1125
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:26,079
What's

1126
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:27,359
Interested

1127
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:33,503
You know it's

1128
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:34,271
Nothing

1129
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:40,927
And this is one of the times we're here

1130
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:42,207
The screeching brakes

1131
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:43,231
Extendo crash

1132
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:52,447
Overdrive here on the 22nd

1133
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:53,727
Eclipse

1134
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:55,519
But you're back Kaiser

1135
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:59,359
Glenn Beck is trying to buy a bunch of property and create a libertarian

1136
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:01,663
Disneyland in the middle of Texas

1137
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:05,759
In the middle of a conversation Alex conveniently remember

1138
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:12,159
He had with a real-estate

1139
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:14,719
What is Newtown

1140
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:18,559
It's ludicrous Alex's is making shut off

1141
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:21,631
Let's catch up with beckville how's that going

1142
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:24,447
I wanted to include clips of this but it's so long

1143
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:29,567
Just decided to tell you about it

1144
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:32,639
It's absurd and

1145
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:37,503
Max Keiser swinging for the fences.

1146
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:40,063
Yeah he goes he goes pretty hard on it

1147
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:48,511
Me to tell you about it for about 45 seconds

1148
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:50,559
Or so

1149
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:52,095
The 23rd

1150
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,119
We get into

1151
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:55,167
Something that I've been waiting for for

1152
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:55,935
For quite a while

1153
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:57,983
And that is for Alex to get specific

1154
01:00:58,495 --> 01:01:00,031
About why he thinks Aurora was

1155
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:17,695
A psychiatrist

1156
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:27,423
National Security

1157
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:42,527
Who I am

1158
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:43,807
So

1159
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:46,879
I've been waiting for a while like I said for Alex to bring up

1160
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:52,511
Specific complaints about the Aurora shooting over the course of a bunch of episodes

1161
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:56,095
That's unsatisfying for me to respond

1162
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:57,119
Conspiracy theories are

1163
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:59,679
Details because

1164
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:03,775
Tire 128-page psychiatric

1165
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:05,823
I'm so much more about this case

1166
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:09,151
I was just reaching for Alex Pappas dumb head above the ground so I could

1167
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:10,175
Ahead

1168
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:15,039
I've seen people remember on the night of July 20th

1169
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:18,111
2012 James Knight Dark Knight Rises

1170
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:20,927
Theater in Aurora Colorado

1171
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:22,975
He preceded set off tear gas

1172
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:29,119
Something similar to tear gas before opening fire ultimately killing 12 people and injuring 70 others

1173
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:34,239
After that he exited the theater and waited for the police to come and arrest as you told the authorities

1174
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:37,311
Are you done some calculations and realized he wouldn't survive the attack

1175
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:40,383
He absolutely committed this horrific Act of terrorism

1176
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:42,687
And in the next however long distance

1177
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:43,711
I will deconstruct

1178
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:45,503
And approve each one of Alex's reason

1179
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:47,039
Thanks for believing this is a false flag

1180
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:48,831
Or as he calls it cartoonishly

1181
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:49,599
Free fake

1182
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:51,903
Do you in advance

1183
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:54,463
Do you have the same last name

1184
01:02:54,975 --> 01:03:01,119
Call Jessica

1185
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:08,543
He's not going to like this

1186
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:11,103
Freezing I probably wouldn't be thrilled

1187
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:16,735
Baby that one I'm fine with

1188
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:19,551
Chicago

1189
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:26,207
Doesn't matter if it's a Murder Castle or not you got a rep

1190
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:26,975
Chicago

1191
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:33,887
Yeah I was going to say something about his creativity

1192
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:36,191
Somali pirates

1193
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:40,543
About the DARPA funding

1194
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:41,311
Control stuff

1195
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:42,591
Better Alex bring

1196
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:44,383
I'm just going to go in order of the complaints

1197
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:45,151
He brought up in

1198
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:47,967
What's a good student

1199
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:50,783
High School ended with a GPA of 3.77

1200
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:51,551
Graduated

1201
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:52,575
82nd in the class

1202
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:53,599
531

1203
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:58,207
You want to do is undergrad at UC Riverside initially setting out to get a Bachelor of Arts

1204
01:03:58,463 --> 01:03:59,487
Sendero sign

1205
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:01,279
Bachelor of Science

1206
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:02,559
Still in neuroscience

1207
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:03,839
A few years in college

1208
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:04,607
Career

1209
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:07,679
Graduated college with a GPA of 3.949

1210
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:10,239
Good student

1211
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:15,103
Psychological evaluation that was done to try and determine whether he was compass

1212
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:22,015
Trial GRE scores but they're literally impossible to be accurate as their numbers way higher than the

1213
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:23,551
GRE test scoring range

1214
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:26,879
There must have been a mistyping

1215
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:31,999
I found said that he was in the 98th percentile for the

1216
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:33,791
Of the GRE and 94th

1217
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:36,095
Percentile for the quantitative score

1218
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:39,423
Dinosaurs that put you well on your way towards scholarship

1219
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:41,471
He's eventually at the most guide

1220
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:44,799
But some of the most top-tier schools

1221
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:50,431
Particularly ones with very specific requirements

1222
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:53,503
My dad is involved in the process of grad school application

1223
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:55,807
For the religious studies Department UT Austin

1224
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:57,855
No smoke at him in the past about the process

1225
01:04:58,367 --> 01:04:59,391
It's very complicated

1226
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:00,671
It's put the concrete terms

1227
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:04,767
Go to school doesn't want to offer one of their limited slots in their grad program

1228
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:06,559
Just somebody that they don't feel will succeed

1229
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:10,399
It could be that they feel like the student would do better in a different program

1230
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:12,703
They're aware of the different programs in different

1231
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:19,103
Angry better ex-wife

1232
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:19,871
Jersey school

1233
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:21,919
So that that's one possibility

1234
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:24,479
Could be as simple as the student

1235
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:31,135
Isn't it good

1236
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:34,719
Say 6 other people that are a better fit apply than you

1237
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:37,535
You may still not get into the program that you apply for

1238
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:40,095
And this is what appears to have happened with home

1239
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:44,703
Neuroscience schools in the country but was rejected by all of them

1240
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:47,775
These were the elite program

1241
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:51,615
So you probably against ahead just as good a test scores

1242
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:52,895
Probably better X

1243
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:55,711
Extracurricular records and almost certainly better interview

1244
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:56,991
Because he was

1245
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:57,759
Socially

1246
01:05:58,271 --> 01:05:59,295
Weird course

1247
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:01,599
Tell most people would describe him

1248
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:06,719
Sure

1249
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:11,071
After getting rejected from the school his parents reported it home sell into a depression

1250
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:13,119
Where you sleep most of the day and watch television

1251
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:16,447
They encouraged him to apply to schools that had a better shot of getting

1252
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:20,287
What are the schools you apply to is the University of Iowa

1253
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:21,055
Is there admission

1254
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:21,823
Process office

1255
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:23,615
Gives a glimpse

1256
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:25,151
Into how the application

1257
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:29,503
The person interviewing him noted that Holmes record was a quote slam dunk

1258
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:31,295
But the interview that he gave

1259
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:33,599
Because Brazil

1260
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:34,879
Disconnected in a loop

1261
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:36,415
With a global lack of

1262
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:37,183
A sack

1263
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:40,767
Administrator went on to tell the admissions

1264
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:45,631
At least five schools and was

1265
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:46,655
Accepted 22

1266
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:51,263
Ultimately choosing University of Colorado at Denver over the University of illinois-urbana

1267
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:56,127
His first year they're his performance was not up to what the high school and undergrad

1268
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:56,895
A careers

1269
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:58,175
Atwood Ave

1270
01:06:58,687 --> 01:06:59,967
Let It Go

1271
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:04,319
It is lab rotation

1272
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:08,415
He was making me uncomfortable with his social awkwardness

1273
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:10,719
His habit of quote uncomfortable

1274
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:13,791
About as far as I could get

1275
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:16,863
Details of that but you got it was too

1276
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:18,911
I've met that guy

1277
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:21,727
He entered the program in June 2011

1278
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:25,055
Any year later he had to undergo his preliminary or Alexa

1279
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:26,591
And on June 7th

1280
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:28,127
12 that was when they were

1281
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:28,895
Take place

1282
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:29,663
The results

1283
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:30,431
We're not good

1284
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:32,223
Pass

1285
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:33,503
The preliminary oral exam

1286
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:35,807
Professors report that James was unable to

1287
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:36,831
A2g

1288
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:37,855
In a timely manner

1289
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:39,903
Organized matter in his answer

1290
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:45,023
They stated that they were concerned that he might not have more than a superficial knowledge of the material

1291
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:46,815
Or that he simply knew the words

1292
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:48,607
To use without understanding the concept

1293
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:52,191
They stated that he performed poorly uniformly

1294
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:54,751
Not just in one particular portion or topic

1295
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:58,591
He felt these exams book Rascals don't kick out student slightly

1296
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:00,639
They told him that he could take a different

1297
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:01,919
The program

1298
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:05,503
Alex believes that he received

1299
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:06,271
Starbucks

1300
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:10,623
The reason for this theory is that Holmes was the recipient of a grant awarded by the national

1301
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:13,183
Idiom out of 26,000.

1302
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:14,975
Grant work

1303
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:17,023
Every year there about 6

1304
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:19,071
New Neuroscience grad student

1305
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:20,095
Sweater the program

1306
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:20,863
I'm at University

1307
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:21,631
Colorado.

1308
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:25,215
From the NIH is given to the school

1309
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:27,007
Another director of the neuroscience

1310
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:30,847
Diego Restrepo along with a group of faculty member

1311
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:31,871
First decide what to do

1312
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:35,199
Didn't choose Jamestown

1313
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:37,503
And they probably actually had no idea

1314
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:38,271
Even was

1315
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:41,087
Each year three of the six new grad student

1316
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:42,367
Get this grant

1317
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:44,415
At 3 second-year students get it as well

1318
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:46,975
50%

1319
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:47,999
Through the school

1320
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:51,327
Especially considering

1321
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:52,607
You look like a super promise

1322
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:55,679
You have to understand that element

1323
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:59,007
He was overqualified on paper for a school like University

1324
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:00,031
Colorado Denver

1325
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:03,103
But unable to pass the more nebulous aspect of the application

1326
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:03,871
Process for a

1327
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:04,895
Your school

1328
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:07,455
This isn't meant to insult people

1329
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:08,735
Colorado Denver

1330
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:11,295
Or anybody involved with the school

1331
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:15,135
But they were probably super excited to have a student like him in their program

1332
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:17,439
Total

1333
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:19,999
I also that Grant is

1334
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:23,583
DARPA funding was involved

1335
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:24,351
At homes

1336
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:27,679
He had mind control worker he was doing b*******

1337
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:29,215
It doesn't take into account

1338
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:31,263
Schools work or any of the facts of the case really

1339
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:34,335
From there the assertions get even Wilder

1340
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:38,431
Article on Infowars about

1341
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:40,735
These connections are super

1342
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:43,295
The first is that Holmes was a researcher

1343
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:44,831
The Salk Institute

1344
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:46,111
San Diego

1345
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:48,159
Instituted work

1346
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:48,927
Starfall

1347
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:50,463
Peak Soldier performance

1348
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:51,231
What's program

1349
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:53,023
Hubble

1350
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:55,071
There there

1351
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:57,119
This is going to be so cute

1352
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:04,543
I'm not take the long road around but a little bit

1353
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:05,311
Is Grandma

1354
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:07,359
Sorry

1355
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:09,151
First problem with his.

1356
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:10,175
Soldier perform

1357
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:12,479
What's program

1358
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:15,039
Scary that program wasn't about mind control or any

1359
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:21,183
Creating cool new things gloves as well as warm

1360
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:22,463
A soldier's hands

1361
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:30,655
Save-A-Lot innovative ways for like wounded soldiers lost limbs being able to

1362
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:37,055
Them have mobility and arm you again

1363
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:40,383
All over the god

1364
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:42,943
That doesn't mean anything definitive

1365
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:48,319
All you have here's a super flimsy connection

1366
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:49,599
That you could use the vents

1367
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:52,927
Majestic relieved that there's way more going on here than you know mean you-4

1368
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:59,327
2015 Janelle

1369
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:00,351
The Salk Institute

1370
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:01,887
The same place that you know

1371
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:07,775
To pursue her Research into quote bolstering a person's microbiomes overcoming infection

1372
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:09,567
Anything suspicious there

1373
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:16,991
That's what they would want you to do they were home from getting all messed up

1374
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:19,807
Super public

1375
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:22,111
And open that every year

1376
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:23,391
The form of their young

1377
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:25,183
Sia War

1378
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:25,951
Junior research

1379
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:30,047
Who became more interesting as maybe James Holmes a gotten one of those

1380
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:31,839
Or they were disproportionately

1381
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:33,119
To the schools that he was at

1382
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:35,679
So conspiracy theories

1383
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:36,703
Conveniently just

1384
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,495
Ignore that part with DARPA splashes

1385
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:39,775
Research money all over the

1386
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:41,311
Making it super

1387
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:43,103
Them

1388
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:44,895
Through webs of

1389
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:47,199
Exaggerated which is all that's going on

1390
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:49,759
What

1391
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:52,831
80% of Grants can be six degrees of separation

1392
01:11:58,207 --> 01:11:59,487
So I don't know what

1393
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:02,559
Globalist would choose to

1394
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:10,495
Controlled

1395
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:13,055
Eclipse

1396
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:13,823
Both

1397
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:16,127
So

1398
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:20,991
So it's sort of Mystery Science Theater with like Joel.

1399
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:25,343
I meant Joe Liz doctor Forrester as well

1400
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:26,623
A very ask

1401
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:27,647
To have it all

1402
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:30,975
The conspiracy at least

1403
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:36,095
This piece of it was largely the result of quote-unquote reporting or speculating

1404
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:38,655
Infowars employee

1405
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:40,959
New if you recall is the guy who are making

1406
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:42,751
Photo with our call Larry Nichols

1407
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:44,799
As you can see again

1408
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:45,823
Super interest

1409
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:49,407
Alex has deep connect

1410
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:50,687
And who has it

1411
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:52,735
Relapsed for Infowars

1412
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:54,783
This point is coming up with the b*******

1413
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:57,087
Crazy Theory propagating

1414
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:58,111
The pattern

1415
01:12:59,135 --> 01:12:59,903
Incredibly consist

1416
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:02,207
Work

1417
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:03,231
Alex Presley

1418
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:05,791
Embedded

1419
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:07,839
No problem

1420
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:12,703
Anytime we medicine comes up a responsibility to remind people that it was p.m.

1421
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:16,799
Said that Hillary Clinton got murdered in a piece of paper

1422
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:22,175
Makes no sense

1423
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:26,271
Navigate to the claim of the top Air Force psychiatrist

1424
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:28,063
Working over whole operation

1425
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:30,111
Antonio woodworking

1426
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:31,903
With home

1427
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:38,559
I know

1428
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:40,351
Less interested than the Air Force

1429
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:46,495
So one of the things that's important to point out your evaluation

1430
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:48,543
Uniforms at determine if you would say nothing

1431
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:50,591
The Colorado mental health in

1432
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:53,663
Conducted interviews with 12 mental health clinician

1433
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:55,199
39

1434
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:56,479
Checklist before and after

1435
01:13:57,503 --> 01:14:02,367
During the relevant period between March 21st and June 11th 2012

1436
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:04,159
Home to seeing a therapist

1437
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:06,463
Through the University of Colorado student health

1438
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:08,767
This therapist was dr.lin

1439
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:11,839
Fenton

1440
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:15,167
Her name was made public very early in the investigation

1441
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:18,239
Because before carrying out the shooting HomeSense

1442
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:20,799
The Notebook that I was lying

1443
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:22,079
Think it's a workbook

1444
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:23,615
They worked on together

1445
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:24,895
He sent her package

1446
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:26,175
They can take that notebook

1447
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:27,711
And because

1448
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:28,735
Let her name got released

1449
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:30,271
Possibly unintentionally

1450
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:31,807
When reports came out about the

1451
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:32,575
Yeah

1452
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:33,599
Okay

1453
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:34,879
It is evaluation

1454
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:37,951
Explain the fear of consequences for his actions

1455
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:38,975
Well working with doctor

1456
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:44,095
When asked about it he says that he didn't tell Fenton about it because he knew that she would lock him up

1457
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:45,887
And quote I would not be able to kill

1458
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:48,191
Not be able to get out of this depression

1459
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:49,215
My worth

1460
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:53,055
More here in a little bit

1461
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:56,127
Probably a good idea

1462
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:02,015
Yeah

1463
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:04,575
It doesn't matter if you told her

1464
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:05,599
Because she got the

1465
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:07,391
It is trial

1466
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:10,719
Testified that there last

1467
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:11,743
He left early

1468
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:14,815
She was so concerned at home

1469
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:17,631
The public in the months before the Aurora theater shooting

1470
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:18,655
That you contacted

1471
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:19,935
Mother

1472
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:21,727
Violation of healthcare private

1473
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:25,823
She breached confidentiality but she decided

1474
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:26,847
Further

1475
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:29,919
Specific enough in their sessions

1476
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:33,247
For him to reach the legal criteria for Hospital

1477
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:37,855
Psychological evaluation

1478
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:40,415
Fenton specifically

1479
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:41,695
So she couldn't hospitalized

1480
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:44,767
He said he couldn't tell her that he was buying weapon

1481
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:46,047
Any details with

1482
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:47,071
The specific plan

1483
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:48,863
Or that he wanted to be locked up

1484
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:49,887
Because if you did

1485
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:51,167
She would hospitalize him

1486
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:53,727
I bet he couldn't carry out his plan which he thought would cure

1487
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:54,751
Depression

1488
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:57,823
There are plenty of people who have questions about whether or not

1489
01:15:58,079 --> 01:15:58,591
She did enough

1490
01:15:58,847 --> 01:16:01,663
Therapist who broke protocol

1491
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:03,711
To try and stop this guy from hurting

1492
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:06,015
Definitely not someone who is his mom

1493
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:08,063
Control Handler

1494
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:11,135
Sure sounds like she was trying to save

1495
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:18,559
Probably more than yours but obviously more than you're supposed to

1496
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:20,095
Like she went

1497
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:22,655
Beyond words

1498
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:24,447
Consider I guess I guess okay

1499
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:27,775
The Conspiracy Theory hinges about her

1500
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:30,847
Mind control doctor from the Air Force

1501
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:33,407
I do hinges on one sentence

1502
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:34,943
X41 CNN article about

1503
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:39,551
She worked as a physician in private practice in Denver

1504
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:40,831
From 1994 to 2000

1505
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:44,159
Physical Medicine for the u.s. Air Force in

1506
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:46,463
San Antonio Texas in the early 90s

1507
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:47,487
According to her resume

1508
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:48,511
That was a

1509
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:51,839
From their speculation ran rampant

1510
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:55,423
Conspiracy chef resume said that she was the

1511
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:56,447
The chief of Physical Medicine

1512
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:57,727
Psychiatrist

1513
01:16:57,983 --> 01:16:59,007
For the u.s. Air Force

1514
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:00,031
Antonio from 90

1515
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:01,567
293

1516
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:03,359
Which is absolutely no proof of anything

1517
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:05,663
Other than that she's a doctor and she had a job

1518
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:07,711
Nowhere does anyone prove that

1519
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:10,527
Physical Medicine or mind control

1520
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:15,391
Nowhere does anyone establish that staff psychiatrist

1521
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:17,951
This is just complete assumption and embellished

1522
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:19,487
These people are carrying off

1523
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:21,791
Cross reference

1524
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:24,607
Though with all the other Air Force had

1525
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:26,399
Physical Medicine

1526
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:27,679
Then we can

1527
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:28,959
Conclude of course

1528
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:30,495
Every mass shooting

1529
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:31,775
Has been in Bradley

1530
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:33,055
Has been traced back to

1531
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:34,591
Air Force

1532
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:37,919
Maybe maybe

1533
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:47,647
Prescribing herself and a few other people.

1534
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:48,415
She knew drugs

1535
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:50,719
Sure

1536
01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:51,743
She's not supposed to do that

1537
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:56,351
Closer examination of what she actually makes me infraction look super minor

1538
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:59,935
Although she was reprimanded in 2005 the incident happened

1539
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:02,239
Between 1997 and 1999

1540
01:18:02,495 --> 01:18:05,311
And they were a Claritin and Ambien for her husband

1541
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:06,335
Who cares

1542
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:09,919
It's crazy

1543
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:12,479
She got three tabs of Xanax

1544
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:15,807
Herself not to take while her mother was in the process of dying

1545
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:18,367
4 Xanax is for a friend who is afraid of

1546
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:20,159
I don't care about any of

1547
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:25,023
Nope not at all 0

1548
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:27,839
Kind of Miss prescribing that I would call a moral

1549
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:30,143
Between

1550
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:33,727
Miss prescribing and then abusing

1551
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:42,175
Stop music

1552
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:49,855
I'm not a part of the medical ethics board

1553
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:51,391
And it's not

1554
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:55,231
Getting tons of Vicodin spell on the street

1555
01:18:55,487 --> 01:19:00,863
Stealing is bad but if you're starving and you stole a loaf of bread over there at 6 months

1556
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:04,959
Either way she was reprimanded for it and I have to take class on property

1557
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:07,263
That's the fitting punishment for what you did

1558
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:08,031
I don't see

1559
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:09,055
Problem

1560
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:12,639
Claritin but it was enough to make a conspiracy

1561
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:13,919
All of a sudden

1562
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:15,455
She turned into an unethical

1563
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:19,295
People started to write blog posts that started with the word

1564
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:21,343
A lot of people are asking

1565
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:26,207
One has to wonder is it possible that

1566
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:28,511
Thrown against the wall

1567
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:30,815
She got her undergrad from UC Davis

1568
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:33,375
Apparently some people believe that they have a monkey called

1569
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:35,167
Control

1570
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:38,495
Force bases

1571
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:39,263
She did 40

1572
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:40,031
Years prior

1573
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:41,311
So she must have to do the same

1574
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:43,103
MKUltra work

1575
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:49,503
These are some of them born on insane. They get thrown around

1576
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:51,551
Playing or are tell you about

1577
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:54,111
So there's literally zero evidence that dr. Fenton

1578
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:56,159
Is anything other than a school psychiatrist

1579
01:19:56,415 --> 01:19:57,951
Who also worked at an Air Force Base 13

1580
01:19:58,207 --> 01:19:58,719
Beatrice Prior

1581
01:19:58,975 --> 01:20:01,791
There's no evidence that she was a quote top Air Force psychiatrist

1582
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:02,559
Psychologist

1583
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:04,607
Especially considering that you only work for them

1584
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:06,911
3 gears and Lackland Air Force Base

1585
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:08,703
Isn't even close to being the biggest

1586
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:17,152
That was damaged

1587
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:23,296
That was that was that quote is what

1588
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:24,576
Talking about

1589
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:28,160
Being a top Air Force psychologist Overholt

1590
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:29,184
San Antonio

1591
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:33,792
True he's just taking tiny details of her life and exaggerating them into what

1592
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:36,096
To help him castration

1593
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:42,240
I know where the seven million episodes but somehow they're still a part of me that is like

1594
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:43,520
Alex

1595
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:45,824
You're cheating this is not

1596
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:51,968
To make it worse

1597
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:54,016
Exactly what you're saying

1598
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:55,808
Much of the primary source in for the

1599
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:59,392
She's about Lynn Fenton traced directly back to

1600
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:05,792
Who again is a very frequent contributor to our relationship with

1601
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:11,936
The fourth our host of Alex's show many of the blog the painter is an unethical therapist

1602
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:17,312
Speculate about her being up to no good with home link back to articles on Rappaport blog

1603
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:22,432
No more as well as articles with his byline on Infowars

1604
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:23,968
Again we can see this

1605
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,760
Alex's Associates

1606
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:26,784
Lindsay bolshit

1607
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:29,088
He spreads it presented as well research

1608
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:32,928
So let's talk about this notebook

1609
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:34,720
Workbook

1610
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:38,304
Alright so we're working together

1611
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:41,120
What's your favorite

1612
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:43,936
They were they awful

1613
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:47,776
This is a different notebook

1614
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:54,176
More upset I would say I guarantee I've looked through the notebook

1615
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:55,200
Morissette

1616
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:58,272
Forsythe National

1617
01:21:58,528 --> 01:22:00,832
Security and they don't want to release that up

1618
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:03,136
So

1619
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:05,696
May 2012 homes began planning issue

1620
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:08,512
What do you hope to do

1621
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:13,120
It's important to note very specifically that he wasn't working on this with any Mental Health

1622
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:16,448
Curricular activities

1623
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:21,824
On Infowars anonymously written article claims without proof that the notebook quote is a notch

1624
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:24,384
We arrange a backstory on home

1625
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:26,176
It portrayed him as a murderess

1626
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:26,944
Psychopath

1627
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:30,016
Keep it expressing his desire to kill since March

1628
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:32,320
12

1629
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:33,088
Miss Bee

1630
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:34,112
As much in a group

1631
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:37,952
He said he wanted to kill people

1632
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:41,280
To which she replies that it's too much effort and he just end up in jail

1633
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:43,840
Holmes replies quote that's why you kill many

1634
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:47,680
In these g chat logs as well as his notebook home

1635
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:50,240
Expressed ideas

1636
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:56,128
It's basically a twisted version of believing that an hour of skilled Labour is intrinsically more valuable than an hour ago

1637
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:58,176
And his consent

1638
01:22:58,432 --> 01:22:59,712
The human capital of a lice

1639
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:00,736
Priceless

1640
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:03,808
So quote you take away life and your human capital is

1641
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:04,576
Is Limitless

1642
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:10,720
You seem to believe that his wife was low on human capital and thereby killing a large number of people

1643
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:14,048
He would get the capital that he was missing

1644
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:15,072
Yes

1645
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:16,096
You felt that raising

1646
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:17,376
Is worth in this way

1647
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:18,656
Human capital level

1648
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:20,704
Was the only way that he could read himself

1649
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:21,728
This terrible depression

1650
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:25,824
Energy chat sessions

1651
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:30,432
Energy chat sessions he expresses that he's not all Eva

1652
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:31,712
And that killing people is

1653
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:35,296
He claims that he found a good path that you would rather try

1654
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:37,344
It is described

1655
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:38,368
In the interviews

1656
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:39,392
Subsequently with him

1657
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:42,208
Is the plan that he had was quote Living a good life

1658
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:44,512
Budget

1659
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:46,560
Okay

1660
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:47,328
Cuz he did go for

1661
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:48,608
Yeah

1662
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:50,400
Holmes Road

1663
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:53,984
2012

1664
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:57,824
Specifically because he knew it wouldn't arrive until after the shooting

1665
01:23:58,592 --> 01:23:59,360
He sent it hours

1666
01:23:59,616 --> 01:24:00,896
Before he would go off to do

1667
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:02,688
So he wanted to torture

1668
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:04,224
He doesn't

1669
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:05,248
Know why

1670
01:24:05,504 --> 01:24:08,320
Mental evaluation

1671
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:09,088
Santa tour

1672
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:11,392
And whether he saw her response would be

1673
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:13,952
And he seemed unable to

1674
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:16,768
Say why he did it

1675
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,048
Sea-Monkey want

1676
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:19,584
Torture her

1677
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:20,608
Seems like it was just

1678
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:22,144
I've been working with her

1679
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:25,216
Almost Yelp from reading it like his response was

1680
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:26,496
She might want to know

1681
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:33,408
But yeah

1682
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:36,480
Know if that was his motive

1683
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:38,528
Think about it it didn't seem like it was a

1684
01:24:38,784 --> 01:24:44,416
If you were writing it up as some kind of unrequited

1685
01:24:44,928 --> 01:24:50,560
Maybe if you're making another version of the notebook notebook

1686
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:53,120
Disturbed thoughts

1687
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:56,192
Send descriptions what he was going through in the months leading up to the shooting

1688
01:24:56,704 --> 01:24:58,496
He discusses deceiving doctor Fenton

1689
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:01,056
How is playing with the coke building

1690
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:02,080
Sense of rapport

1691
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:03,104
Truthfully

1692
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:04,640
Incriminating question

1693
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:10,272
So he was intentionally withholding information for a drummer in order to be able to follow through with

1694
01:25:10,528 --> 01:25:11,040
The plant

1695
01:25:11,552 --> 01:25:14,624
Throughout the notebook homes presented himself as having a lifelong struggle about the

1696
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:16,928
The question of the meaning of life

1697
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:17,952
As well as the meaning

1698
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:20,000
It's a question you can't solve

1699
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:21,792
And it seems to give him

1700
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:23,584
The solution he arrives at

1701
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:27,424
Is that quote if you destroy all life then there is no question

1702
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:29,728
So you believe that

1703
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:32,288
Which is really Brandy

1704
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,616
Who discusses having these grandiose thoughts

1705
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:36,384
Since the age of 10

1706
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,664
Imagine

1707
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:38,432
Do something

1708
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:39,712
Everyone in the world

1709
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:40,480
Yeah

1710
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:44,320
Bipolar

1711
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:47,648
I've had delusions of grandeur groups

1712
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:50,208
Like it's like a

1713
01:25:50,976 --> 01:25:53,792
Disconcerting number of times where I'm surprised

1714
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:56,096
I'm still allowed

1715
01:25:58,912 --> 01:26:01,728
So it is

1716
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:03,264
Totally understand

1717
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:04,544
How that can

1718
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,080
Twisted Warp

1719
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:07,616
In ways that you

1720
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:08,384
Like

1721
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:10,432
It's impossible to really kind of

1722
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:12,224
Explain to somebody who's never

1723
01:26:12,736 --> 01:26:18,880
Experience that none of this is to say that what he did was open.

1724
01:26:19,136 --> 01:26:20,672
Provide an explanation

1725
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:23,488
Is is not to minimize his actions are excused

1726
01:26:23,744 --> 01:26:24,256
No

1727
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:25,792
Explain

1728
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:27,328
Conspiracy that Alex's picture

1729
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:29,632
This is something

1730
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:30,912
This notebook

1731
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:32,704
Created on his own

1732
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:35,776
Who knows maybe it helped him

1733
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:37,824
Feel like he was doing something

1734
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:40,384
From the fact that you was going

1735
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:41,664
2 KB

1736
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:43,200
Intellectualize

1737
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:44,992
Work through these issues

1738
01:26:45,248 --> 01:26:47,296
And it had nothing to do with Doctor Fenton

1739
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:48,576
You sent it to her

1740
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:50,880
Before you at did the crime

1741
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:52,416
Knowing that it would arrive later

1742
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:54,976
Yeah very clear from the available information

1743
01:26:55,232 --> 01:26:57,792
Not as

1744
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:02,400
By empathizer or this is the explanation

1745
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:05,216
That's a terrifying reality is

1746
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:10,080
Minimize it there's so many other factors but like

1747
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:14,176
There but for the grace of God go I that kind of situation

1748
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:16,992
You know it's a it's a nightmarish thing to

1749
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:21,344
So

1750
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:22,368
Buck

1751
01:27:22,624 --> 01:27:24,928
Multiple shooters

1752
01:27:25,184 --> 01:27:26,976
There's always reports of multiple shooters

1753
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:31,328
That's not enough evidence

1754
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:35,168
Conspiracy everything that's ever happened probably

1755
01:27:36,192 --> 01:27:42,336
I've looked the conspiracies about the idea of multiple Shooters being involved in the shooting

1756
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:47,456
It's all pretty standard stuff about police dispatcher saying maybe multiple shooters

1757
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:49,504
And Witnesses reporting

1758
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:51,552
Someone said someone was shooting in the lobby

1759
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:54,112
So although all that sort of stuff is

1760
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:56,672
Exactly what you see at every situation

1761
01:27:57,184 --> 01:28:03,328
There is only one shooter with so little

1762
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:09,216
So the question is jailhouse confession

1763
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:10,752
If not knowing who he is and he

1764
01:28:11,008 --> 01:28:12,288
He's drugged up

1765
01:28:12,544 --> 01:28:17,152
Psychological evaluation

1766
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:18,176
To alter his appearance

1767
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:18,944
That's for the shooting

1768
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:23,808
Decided

1769
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:25,856
The part of himself

1770
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:28,928
He bought black contact lenses

1771
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:33,024
Shooting quote as a way to differentiate myself from my normal self

1772
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:34,816
Jesus's Red Dragon

1773
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:38,144
He said that you liked the look because it looked like he was

1774
01:28:39,424 --> 01:28:40,704
In the initial police report

1775
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:44,544
The first officers made contact with him pointed out that his eyes were very dilated

1776
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:47,104
But this was before they knew that he had black contacts

1777
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:54,016
This is where the misconceptions come from Dorothy was whacked out on drugs

1778
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:58,880
Complete explanation explanation

1779
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:06,560
So you taking one Vicodin an hour prior to going to the theater just in case he got injured while doing the shooting but other than that

1780
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:07,328
Completely clean

1781
01:29:07,584 --> 01:29:08,352
Of alcohol

1782
01:29:08,864 --> 01:29:09,376
Street drugs

1783
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:12,960
So he wasn't medications but by that time

1784
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:16,544
Possibility

1785
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:17,568
He rejected the idea

1786
01:29:17,824 --> 01:29:18,592
DIY was working with doctor

1787
01:29:18,848 --> 01:29:20,384
Because

1788
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:21,664
Failed out of school

1789
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:22,432
His insurance

1790
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:23,968
The program wouldn't cover

1791
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:31,648
Into the Joker

1792
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:36,512
Again it was an attempt to differentiate who he was going to be from the part of himself

1793
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:38,048
Betty felt was good

1794
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:41,888
Disappearance because I would not my normal

1795
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:45,728
Good that's another part of it is that like

1796
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:50,080
Text because my insurance

1797
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:54,176
Might be what

1798
01:29:54,432 --> 01:29:55,456
Eve used as a

1799
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:01,856
Particular

1800
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:04,928
Isn't it simply because

1801
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:08,768
Look it's good teachable moments

1802
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:11,840
So that was about protecting the part of himself that he thought was

1803
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:13,376
Good all these changes of his

1804
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:16,960
Alter his physical appearance

1805
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:20,032
Himself anymore and that quote the other me did everything

1806
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:26,176
Therefore it is pretty clear that though this is psychologically relevant it doesn't present with the same symptoms

1807
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:26,944
Disassociation

1808
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:27,712
Turn off

1809
01:30:28,224 --> 01:30:30,272
Compartmentalize

1810
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:31,552
Largely willful

1811
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:34,624
Through all of it

1812
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:38,976
After you put in custody Homestuck a predictable turn for the worse

1813
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:42,048
The ideas about being able to erase

1814
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:44,864
Does human capital and free himself from his depression by killing

1815
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:45,632
Hadn't worked

1816
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:46,912
He was still depressed

1817
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:49,472
He descended into a full-on psychotic break

1818
01:30:49,984 --> 01:30:52,032
Requiring staff to restrain him for his own safety

1819
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:55,360
He was banging his head on walls and apparently trying to fall from his bed

1820
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:57,152
In a manner so as to fall on his head

1821
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:59,456
Dr. Fraser reported that he

1822
01:30:59,712 --> 01:31:00,992
You did not know where he was

1823
01:31:01,248 --> 01:31:03,040
And that is think it was completely disorganized

1824
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:05,600
And talked a lot about being a quote shadow box

1825
01:31:06,112 --> 01:31:07,648
And the need to hide from Shadows

1826
01:31:07,904 --> 01:31:09,952
But this is absurd

1827
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:14,048
He was put on Risperidone

1828
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:15,584
And responded very well

1829
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:20,704
He became able to organize his thoughts enough to understand

1830
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:23,008
Is auditory and visual hallucinations

1831
01:31:23,264 --> 01:31:24,032
Subsided as well

1832
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:25,824
They also found that he was in a

1833
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,104
Starvation delirium

1834
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:30,944
Due to not eating cuz you was paranoid about the food provided at the hospital

1835
01:31:33,248 --> 01:31:34,272
Improve dramatically

1836
01:31:34,784 --> 01:31:37,344
During that time he was also put on the right medication

1837
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,904
He was before

1838
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:42,208
S***

1839
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:44,000
Doctors would have heard him saying

1840
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,560
The stories about the things

1841
01:31:46,816 --> 01:31:50,400
Imprison all come from

1842
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:51,680
What's the time

1843
01:31:51,936 --> 01:31:52,704
Steve Unruh

1844
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:55,264
Claimed it while they were both

1845
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:59,104
Sal's here 24-hour talk with talked about committing suicide

1846
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:03,968
Evil therapist

1847
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:09,088
What we do know for sure is that Unruh was at the Arapahoe Sheriff's Detention

1848
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:09,856
Facility

1849
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:10,880
The hours before the shooting

1850
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:12,160
Haven't been arrested

1851
01:32:12,416 --> 01:32:13,184
Dragon set

1852
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:16,000
Although

1853
01:32:16,256 --> 01:32:16,768
Prisoners are

1854
01:32:18,048 --> 01:32:19,584
Communicate through gaps in cell door

1855
01:32:20,864 --> 01:32:24,704
Multiple officers at the Sheriff's Department

1856
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:25,728
And said the communication

1857
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:28,032
Like Unruh is depriving is

1858
01:32:28,288 --> 01:32:28,800
Impossible

1859
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:30,336
Due to the layout of the whole thing

1860
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:32,128
So

1861
01:32:32,384 --> 01:32:32,896
That's one

1862
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:36,992
Problem with historic perhaps

1863
01:32:37,248 --> 01:32:41,344
Plane on the idea that we have for movies of the jails being bars

1864
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:42,368
And you can

1865
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:43,136
Still like

1866
01:32:43,392 --> 01:32:45,184
Even if it's a solid wall

1867
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:46,464
Between

1868
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:48,000
Through the bars

1869
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:51,328
A big person

1870
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:53,376
Gave him and told him to call

1871
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:59,776
That number goes to a bereavement counselor

1872
01:33:00,032 --> 01:33:00,544
North Devon

1873
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:07,456
He claims that Holmes tried to send a letter in prison but that it was intercepted but no official record of an interception

1874
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:08,224
Our letter x

1875
01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:11,040
Shark movie

1876
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:18,464
Given the unlikely nature of their communication be possible

1877
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:20,256
I see this with a little bit of skepticism

1878
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:24,608
Probably one important thing to consider is that true just been released

1879
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:25,888
From 6 years in prison

1880
01:33:26,144 --> 01:33:27,424
Admitted been re-arrested

1881
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:28,192
Was looking to

1882
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:31,264
From an article in Westworld

1883
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:32,032
Quotes

1884
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:33,312
He's going public with us

1885
01:33:33,568 --> 01:33:38,176
Account of the encounter with the Arapahoe County District

1886
01:33:38,432 --> 01:33:39,712
Attorney's office in a story

1887
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:42,784
He's currently facing habitual criminal charges and it helped

1888
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:44,832
Mental health treatment

1889
01:33:45,088 --> 01:33:46,368
Rather than a 12-year prison

1890
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:49,440
Although investigator

1891
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:51,488
The DEA hasn't been working with

1892
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:52,512
He sighs

1893
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:55,328
Occam's razor

1894
01:33:55,584 --> 01:33:58,400
And it unroe was spending it to cut DeLand somehow turn

1895
01:33:58,656 --> 01:34:00,448
A coincidence that he was in the holding at the

1896
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:02,240
Appositive

1897
01:34:03,008 --> 01:34:04,288
The DEA didn't believe his stories

1898
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:07,360
To the public

1899
01:34:07,616 --> 01:34:08,128
See if you can find any

1900
01:34:09,664 --> 01:34:14,272
It's also probably worth noting that in 2014 Steve on roof self-published book called the truth

1901
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:16,064
Massacre at Cinema 16

1902
01:34:16,576 --> 01:34:18,112
And here is the description of that

1903
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:23,232
Addiction relapse

1904
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:25,024
And also in a mass murderers life

1905
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:28,096
Just hours after the man kills 12 people and injured 70

1906
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:29,120
The killer wants to

1907
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:32,448
Commit suicide and the author is used as a power

1908
01:34:32,704 --> 01:34:34,496
Dupree with the killer convinced him to repent

1909
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:36,544
I talked him out of his Suicidal Thoughts

1910
01:34:37,568 --> 01:34:40,384
I think all this is pretty simple pretty simple explanation

1911
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:42,688
That is true is not a good source of

1912
01:34:42,944 --> 01:34:44,480
Information and we should not believe

1913
01:34:44,736 --> 01:34:45,760
About the jailhouse confession

1914
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:47,296
It seems kind of

1915
01:34:47,552 --> 01:34:48,064
Likee

1916
01:34:48,832 --> 01:34:50,368
Inopportune

1917
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:52,928
Oh man

1918
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:59,584
Is it any good did you read I didn't cuz it's I couldn't find a PDF of it or anything but

1919
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:00,608
And a lot of

1920
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:01,888
Indications that

1921
01:35:02,144 --> 01:35:08,288
The people who published it the house that published is on a lot of people

1922
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:09,824
A lot of warning

1923
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:11,872
Gotcha

1924
01:35:12,128 --> 01:35:13,152
Big things about don't

1925
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:14,432
Work with

1926
01:35:14,688 --> 01:35:17,504
It may not be one of the more credible publishers

1927
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:18,272
Of books

1928
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:19,040
Which

1929
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:20,064
Surprise

1930
01:35:21,344 --> 01:35:24,672
It's one of those games where he wound up paying a lot

1931
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:27,488
Did not he did not recoup

1932
01:35:38,496 --> 01:35:39,520
Future future

1933
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:40,800
This is

1934
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:43,616
A complete rundown of all of the conspiracies

1935
01:35:43,872 --> 01:35:45,920
Is the people spin about the Aurora shooting

1936
01:35:46,176 --> 01:35:46,688
But

1937
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:48,480
There's no way that you possibly

1938
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:54,880
Could I do what I want specific claims position

1939
01:35:55,136 --> 01:35:56,160
Parachuting with cartoonist

1940
01:35:56,928 --> 01:35:58,208
And obviously a false flag

1941
01:35:58,720 --> 01:35:59,488
None of them stand up

1942
01:35:59,744 --> 01:36:01,024
The scrutiny even in the least

1943
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:03,328
And easily cast aside but as

1944
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:05,632
Completely manufactured or misrepresented B

1945
01:36:05,888 --> 01:36:06,400
Information

1946
01:36:06,656 --> 01:36:08,448
Speaking of predetermined conclusion

1947
01:36:08,704 --> 01:36:09,472
Namely that the shoe

1948
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:11,776
Is evidence that the shooting is

1949
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:13,312
Cartoonishly fake is

1950
01:36:13,568 --> 01:36:14,336
Cartoonish Lee awful

1951
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:16,896
At least series I can trace back

1952
01:36:17,152 --> 01:36:20,224
Specifically to Infowars contributors as either being the root of

1953
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:22,784
The theory or being the largest propagators

1954
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:24,576
Once they got robbed

1955
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:32,512
Seems important ultimately what's going on here is Alex's aggressively arguing with the Aurora shooting

1956
01:36:32,768 --> 01:36:34,304
Was fake to justify his position

1957
01:36:35,584 --> 01:36:38,144
Claims about Aurora you can clearly see that there's

1958
01:36:38,656 --> 01:36:39,168
No-spa

1959
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:40,704
Here for a Sandy Hook

1960
01:36:41,472 --> 01:36:41,984
And in fact

1961
01:36:42,752 --> 01:36:43,520
Behavior look worse

1962
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:45,568
Very stupid

1963
01:36:55,552 --> 01:37:01,696
Do we ever referee somewhere to be like not know you're cheating Jordan unfortunately you've just described what

1964
01:37:01,952 --> 01:37:04,000
What we are becoming

1965
01:37:04,256 --> 01:37:10,144
NBA referees

1966
01:37:11,168 --> 01:37:13,984
So let's move on to the next clip where Alex has

1967
01:37:15,264 --> 01:37:15,776
She is going to win

1968
01:37:16,032 --> 01:37:16,544
Oh no

1969
01:37:18,848 --> 01:37:23,456
Contacted

1970
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:24,992
On the

1971
01:37:27,296 --> 01:37:28,832
Another

1972
01:37:29,088 --> 01:37:35,232
Ford.com

1973
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:37,792
Oh no

1974
01:37:42,144 --> 01:37:45,984
Skateboard company at least it's big enough that I ate. Skateboarder

1975
01:37:46,752 --> 01:37:50,848
It's real f*****-up

1976
01:37:51,104 --> 01:37:53,408
That's f***** up they released decks in collaboration with

1977
01:37:53,664 --> 01:37:54,176
Infowars

1978
01:37:54,432 --> 01:37:55,200
January 23rd

1979
01:37:56,224 --> 01:38:02,368
But it also does speak to something that I've learned from doing a lot of skaters over the course of my life

1980
01:38:02,624 --> 01:38:04,672
And some of them are pretty clever but they're not the best

1981
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:06,208
General

1982
01:38:07,232 --> 01:38:13,120
Is that the time Alien Workshop was owned by Rob Dyrdek

1983
01:38:13,376 --> 01:38:17,472
Star of the delightful TV shows Robin big and Rob Dyrdek's Fantasy Factory

1984
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:21,312
Really sad for me to realize that he put out an Infowars deck

1985
01:38:21,568 --> 01:38:23,104
Between the 5th and 6th

1986
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:24,640
Seasons of fantasy factory

1987
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:31,808
Rob

1988
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:40,256
Makes me look a little differently enjoy those shows

1989
01:38:40,512 --> 01:38:42,560
Show Android Robin big quite a bit

1990
01:38:44,864 --> 01:38:46,144
And most the responses

1991
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:48,192
Confined or not positive

1992
01:38:48,448 --> 01:38:51,264
Ranging from a red, that just says pluck out

1993
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:55,104
To a message board threat accusing Alien Workshop of being a state

1994
01:38:55,360 --> 01:39:00,224
Company their boards and clothes

1995
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:04,320
Alright are they also accused of selling out for working

1996
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:06,624
Which is pretty funny to imagine the cobra

1997
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:09,696
The point of which someone would accuse our two

1998
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:16,608
The radar

1999
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:17,632
This is nothing

2000
01:39:17,888 --> 01:39:22,496
Neither of them. They wanted out of people attacking Alien Workshop and Alex

2001
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:28,896
Perfect synthesis of the bad parts of your heart.

2002
01:39:31,712 --> 01:39:34,272
Sorry Rob I'm out

2003
01:39:39,136 --> 01:39:39,648
Alright

2004
01:39:39,904 --> 01:39:42,208
All right I told you earlier

2005
01:39:42,464 --> 01:39:43,488
I told you earlier

2006
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:45,280
We were going to meet

2007
01:39:45,792 --> 01:39:46,560
A real crazy

2008
01:39:46,816 --> 01:39:47,840
A real bad purse

2009
01:39:48,096 --> 01:39:48,864
Real monster

2010
01:39:52,704 --> 01:39:57,056
Yeah really excited about the opportunity to talk about the Aurora shooting

2011
01:39:57,312 --> 01:39:59,104
Because Alex brings it up all the time

2012
01:40:00,384 --> 01:40:00,896
Could be safe

2013
01:40:03,712 --> 01:40:04,992
To do that

2014
01:40:05,504 --> 01:40:06,272
Probably like

2015
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:08,832
20 minutes half an hour of this episode

2016
01:40:09,088 --> 01:40:13,696
I'm sorry it's not for anybody but it's essential that we cover that as we go through

2017
01:40:14,208 --> 01:40:14,976
It's a big piece of the ship

2018
01:40:15,488 --> 01:40:16,000
Fight

2019
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:18,048
Thought that was going to be

2020
01:40:19,072 --> 01:40:19,584
Okay

2021
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:20,352
And then crazy

2022
01:40:20,864 --> 01:40:21,376
Alright

2023
01:40:21,632 --> 01:40:23,680
I was like

2024
01:40:23,936 --> 01:40:29,568
More interesting, Moto Moto

2025
01:40:29,824 --> 01:40:30,336
Asia

2026
01:40:40,064 --> 01:40:44,160
I'm going to just go ahead and play this clip and then I'll explain why this is super exciting

2027
01:41:42,016 --> 01:41:44,576
FM 92.1

2028
01:41:45,344 --> 01:41:47,392
Incredible

2029
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:52,000
Long time I've heard Alex make

2030
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:52,768
The following are key

2031
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:54,304
Which is what he's talking about

2032
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:55,584
Jim Garrow

2033
01:41:56,096 --> 01:41:56,608
Talk about

2034
01:41:56,864 --> 01:41:58,144
Obama

2035
01:41:58,400 --> 01:41:59,936
Bloodthirsty Patriot haters

2036
01:42:00,192 --> 01:42:02,496
The highest offices of the military the police

2037
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:06,336
In order to achieve this goal these put it a litmus test in for advance

2038
01:42:09,152 --> 01:42:10,176
Central Canada

2039
01:42:12,736 --> 01:42:15,552
Sometimes this couch days shooting people

2040
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:21,952
Dinosaur wouldn't go along with martial law

2041
01:42:22,208 --> 01:42:23,488
Alex wants to push

2042
01:42:23,744 --> 01:42:24,256
The point is the same

2043
01:42:24,768 --> 01:42:29,632
Obama selectively promoting Patriot haters so they can have a top-down control

2044
01:42:29,888 --> 01:42:32,704
Over Law Enforcement which will then press Alex and his friends

2045
01:42:33,472 --> 01:42:35,520
I've literally never once thought to look at it

2046
01:42:35,776 --> 01:42:37,312
That's because it sounds like complete

2047
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:38,848
And just dumped paranoid

2048
01:42:39,616 --> 01:42:43,200
But one of the other reasons I never looked into it and I never wanted to dig into it

2049
01:42:43,456 --> 01:42:45,248
Was it Alex never gives a citation

2050
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:51,648
3999 4420

2051
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:55,744
You never talk about where you got this information from

2052
01:42:56,256 --> 01:43:01,376
So I'm happy to look into all sorts of obviously not true things

2053
01:43:01,632 --> 01:43:02,400
Better use of my

2054
01:43:02,656 --> 01:43:04,192
My time not much better

2055
01:43:04,448 --> 01:43:05,728
Slightly.

2056
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:11,360
Silver platter Alex tells me that he got this information from

2057
01:43:11,872 --> 01:43:13,152
Even makes it seem a little bit too

2058
01:43:13,408 --> 01:43:16,736
Clear that clip that goes claims are all he has.

2059
01:43:16,992 --> 01:43:19,808
And he's taking his word for it because he thinks Garrow is credible

2060
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:21,088
Who is

2061
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:23,904
If the debate is based on Cairo

2062
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:25,184
Darrow's credibility

2063
01:43:25,696 --> 01:43:28,256
I can look into

2064
01:43:29,792 --> 01:43:30,816
And then it says

2065
01:43:31,328 --> 01:43:32,864
Welcome to Infowars

2066
01:43:33,632 --> 01:43:34,656
You're not a trustworthy so

2067
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:39,264
I don't care

2068
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:43,104
Lizzo flute

2069
01:43:43,616 --> 01:43:45,664
Here are some of the completely unfounded claims

2070
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:46,688
But he has made over the

2071
01:43:47,712 --> 01:43:53,856
He was a radio show where he claimed that he knew Breitbart

2072
01:43:54,112 --> 01:43:55,136
Hastings were all killed

2073
01:43:55,392 --> 01:43:57,440
Under direct orders by Barack Obama

2074
01:43:57,696 --> 01:43:59,744
Because they leave the key wasn't actually in America

2075
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,560
President

2076
01:44:04,096 --> 01:44:05,120
Did Tom Clancy

2077
01:44:05,376 --> 01:44:06,656
Specifically know this

2078
01:44:09,216 --> 01:44:12,800
Sources man you think he does write a book

2079
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:18,432
I don't because he doesn't like

2080
01:44:18,688 --> 01:44:21,760
4 books

2081
01:44:22,272 --> 01:44:24,832
On the Tea Party podcast

2082
01:44:25,088 --> 01:44:27,136
He claimed that Obama was in touch with

2083
01:44:27,392 --> 01:44:28,416
Or some group that would

2084
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:30,464
It's kind of Uncle

2085
01:44:30,976 --> 01:44:35,072
Either way Obama was planning to unveil the contact with these aliens

2086
01:44:35,328 --> 01:44:37,632
Which is dangerously close to the plot of childhood

2087
01:44:39,936 --> 01:44:46,080
On November and November 2013 you went on another right-wing show and alleged that Obama and George Soros working fire

2088
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:47,872
American

2089
01:44:48,128 --> 01:44:54,272
Newk's on Tuesdays

2090
01:44:54,528 --> 01:45:00,672
Obama Soros and Valerie June

2091
01:45:00,928 --> 01:45:04,000
Quantitative easing

2092
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:05,792
Ninety percent of the population

2093
01:45:06,304 --> 01:45:08,096
So he goes on

2094
01:45:08,352 --> 01:45:11,680
To argue that Obama almost carried out this plan

2095
01:45:11,936 --> 01:45:18,080
But he was stopped at the last minute military map

2096
01:45:18,336 --> 01:45:20,896
Misfits

2097
01:45:21,152 --> 01:45:26,528
He said that Obama and Soros

2098
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:37,024
There's literally no evidence that any of this ever happened in Nuuk

2099
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:44,448
For his part in this imaginary place

2100
01:45:44,704 --> 01:45:45,216
Okay

2101
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:48,288
I don't think that's how we

2102
01:45:48,544 --> 01:45:50,080
Seems dangerous

2103
01:45:51,872 --> 01:45:52,896
He claimed it Obama tried

2104
01:45:53,152 --> 01:45:54,176
The Killing by sabotaging

2105
01:45:54,432 --> 01:45:55,968
God protect

2106
01:45:56,736 --> 01:46:01,088
More likely decided to

2107
01:46:02,368 --> 01:46:02,880
Publix

2108
01:46:03,136 --> 01:46:04,416
He's claimed

2109
01:46:07,232 --> 01:46:10,304
And is also accused Obama of being a secret

2110
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:12,096
Operative along with Saudi Arabia

2111
01:46:12,608 --> 01:46:13,120
Anybody else

2112
01:46:13,632 --> 01:46:15,424
Probably

2113
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:16,704
He's not working with

2114
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:18,240
Against being serious

2115
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:22,336
They are working against the United States Obama

2116
01:46:22,592 --> 01:46:24,128
By definition work with that

2117
01:46:24,384 --> 01:46:24,896
I suppose

2118
01:46:25,152 --> 01:46:30,016
It was part of his original.

2119
01:46:30,272 --> 01:46:36,416
He began claiming that he was a former CIA officer

2120
01:46:36,672 --> 01:46:42,816
Overtime

2121
01:46:43,072 --> 01:46:49,216
Is the Dutchman 2013 by Obama and Valerie Jarrett

2122
01:46:49,472 --> 01:46:51,776
Oh great was this before or after they tried to bother

2123
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:54,592
A few problems this story

2124
01:46:56,128 --> 01:46:56,896
MCI at 8

2125
01:46:57,152 --> 01:46:58,688
You also have to have a bachelor's degree

2126
01:46:59,456 --> 01:46:59,968
Reply

2127
01:47:00,224 --> 01:47:02,528
It's not unheard of to have a bachelor's at the age of 18

2128
01:47:02,784 --> 01:47:03,552
Super unlikely

2129
01:47:04,064 --> 01:47:05,856
Especially if

2130
01:47:07,136 --> 01:47:08,416
Another one

2131
01:47:08,928 --> 01:47:15,072
Another requirement is that you have to have experience in a relevant field

2132
01:47:15,328 --> 01:47:16,864
Like being in the military or law enforcement

2133
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:19,168
My which I don't Euro story

2134
01:47:20,192 --> 01:47:20,704
Static required

2135
01:47:21,216 --> 01:47:24,032
Both of you have to be a citizen of the US

2136
01:47:24,288 --> 01:47:27,104
CIA

2137
01:47:33,248 --> 01:47:37,856
I should point out

2138
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:44,512
His bio is written by an alternate route

2139
01:47:46,816 --> 01:47:52,960
Alright alright

2140
01:47:53,216 --> 01:47:54,240
He was born in

2141
01:47:54,496 --> 01:47:56,032
And it lived most of his life in Canada

2142
01:47:57,568 --> 01:47:58,080
30s

2143
01:48:01,152 --> 01:48:02,176
Yazbek Canadian

2144
01:48:02,432 --> 01:48:03,456
Aboot

2145
01:48:03,968 --> 01:48:09,088
Sort of vowel pronunciation

2146
01:48:09,344 --> 01:48:09,856
Canada

2147
01:48:10,112 --> 01:48:10,880
Furlong.

2148
01:48:11,136 --> 01:48:11,648
Oh boy

2149
01:48:12,416 --> 01:48:13,440
He has a profile on IMD

2150
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:15,232
Bbsi mentioned because in 2050

2151
01:48:15,744 --> 01:48:17,280
Started

2152
01:48:17,792 --> 01:48:19,328
Appearing in nothing you've ever heard of

2153
01:48:22,144 --> 01:48:25,216
Girl did two episodes of a show called Shadowland

2154
01:48:25,472 --> 01:48:28,288
Performance

2155
01:48:28,544 --> 01:48:29,056
Fly fishing

2156
01:48:36,736 --> 01:48:38,784
He called himself doctor Jim Garrow because

2157
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:43,904
Doctorate degree from North Carolina College of theology

2158
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:44,672
It's cool

2159
01:48:44,928 --> 01:48:47,232
Any case anyone wants to go back and look through the records and

2160
01:48:47,488 --> 01:48:48,512
Pull up his coursework

2161
01:48:48,768 --> 01:48:51,584
Don't worry about it because

2162
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:52,608
Degree of Honor

2163
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:54,144
So he didn't actually even

2164
01:48:54,656 --> 01:49:00,800
A place where you could probably buy an honorary non-accredited

2165
01:49:01,056 --> 01:49:03,104
Geology in North Carolina

2166
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:04,896
Like many weirdos Alex

2167
01:49:05,152 --> 01:49:07,712
Girl claims for a Nobel Prize

2168
01:49:07,968 --> 01:49:08,992
Lost

2169
01:49:09,248 --> 01:49:10,528
Specifically to Obama

2170
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:13,344
That's only further igniting the Rivalry

2171
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:14,880
Now I will say this

2172
01:49:15,392 --> 01:49:18,208
I too agree that Obama did not deserve that

2173
01:49:18,464 --> 01:49:18,976
Peace Prize

2174
01:49:19,232 --> 01:49:20,768
I'm also going to say that

2175
01:49:21,024 --> 01:49:26,656
Hero does not deserve it either or situation

2176
01:49:33,056 --> 01:49:34,080
United States

2177
01:49:35,616 --> 01:49:36,384
He will say

2178
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:38,176
Like Obama

2179
01:49:38,688 --> 01:49:42,016
Personal grudges

2180
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:49,184
He's a user by the name of Jim Garrow also

2181
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:53,024
The claim of his lost Lowdown nomination

2182
01:49:53,536 --> 01:49:59,680
In 2001 Garrow tried to run a flight school at the Region of Waterloo International Airport in Canada

2183
01:50:01,472 --> 01:50:06,592
He got a little bit of trouble in transit

2184
01:50:07,104 --> 01:50:10,176
Leading to a $2,850

2185
01:50:10,432 --> 01:50:12,736
After quote

2186
01:50:12,992 --> 01:50:13,504
Intentionally

2187
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:15,296
Steve instructors

2188
01:50:15,552 --> 01:50:21,696
2850 dollars is beat

2189
01:50:21,952 --> 01:50:22,976
Alma School

2190
01:50:23,232 --> 01:50:25,792
Alright open today that I don't know if I

2191
01:50:26,304 --> 01:50:27,072
Jim garrels very crowded

2192
01:50:27,328 --> 01:50:32,448
Will stores

2193
01:50:32,704 --> 01:50:36,544
Based on all this other b*******

2194
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:40,128
A former eighteen-year-old

2195
01:50:40,896 --> 01:50:43,712
You're going to you're going to Texas

2196
01:50:43,968 --> 01:50:47,040
All other available sources over this man

2197
01:50:47,296 --> 01:50:48,832
Well maybe I'm being a little bit

2198
01:50:49,088 --> 01:50:50,624
Too quick to judge

2199
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:55,232
Because there's other things

2200
01:50:57,024 --> 01:50:58,304
Is the Jim Garrow.

2201
01:51:01,376 --> 01:51:01,888
Almost

2202
01:51:02,656 --> 01:51:06,496
No one of these

2203
01:51:17,248 --> 01:51:20,064
Children from China

2204
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:34,912
So

2205
01:51:36,448 --> 01:51:42,080
45000

2206
01:51:42,592 --> 01:51:43,104
He's a hero

2207
01:51:43,616 --> 01:51:44,128
Also

2208
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:49,504
That's Alex's portraying David adoption

2209
01:51:52,064 --> 01:51:52,576
What

2210
01:51:52,832 --> 01:51:54,880
Save them from being eliminated

2211
01:51:55,136 --> 01:51:57,184
Yes it's sticking a little

2212
01:51:57,440 --> 01:52:01,792
Alex

2213
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:05,120
Next BART

2214
01:52:05,376 --> 01:52:06,144
Source from a grape

2215
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:07,680
Macro lens

2216
01:52:07,936 --> 01:52:09,216
Guelph Mercury

2217
01:52:11,776 --> 01:52:12,288
Investigative

2218
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:13,312
On

2219
01:52:13,568 --> 01:52:14,080
Jim Garrow

2220
01:52:16,384 --> 01:52:17,152
Might blow your mind

2221
01:52:17,664 --> 01:52:18,432
Really don't think so

2222
01:52:18,944 --> 01:52:21,504
Alex

2223
01:52:22,016 --> 01:52:24,576
Describe 45,000

2224
01:52:25,344 --> 01:52:26,112
It's one of the reasons

2225
01:52:29,184 --> 01:52:29,952
This organization called

2226
01:52:30,464 --> 01:52:30,976
Pagoda

2227
01:52:31,232 --> 01:52:33,792
Raclaims to alternatively the number varies

2228
01:52:35,328 --> 01:52:37,120
Sometimes it's 34,000

2229
01:52:38,656 --> 01:52:41,984
Children

2230
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:43,776
Abandoned or killed them

2231
01:52:44,032 --> 01:52:45,824
One child policy

2232
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:46,592
Question

2233
01:52:46,848 --> 01:52:48,640
Right it's called pink pagoda

2234
01:52:51,456 --> 01:52:52,480
To your question Chinese

2235
01:52:52,992 --> 01:52:53,504
Don't worry about it

2236
01:52:54,016 --> 01:52:54,528
Okay

2237
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:56,064
Really feel like as a

2238
01:52:56,320 --> 01:52:58,368
If he's really doing this

2239
01:52:58,624 --> 01:52:59,392
Good on him

2240
01:53:00,416 --> 01:53:04,000
However some Blu-ray some questions about whether or not Garrow is just me

2241
01:53:04,256 --> 01:53:04,768
Making all this stuff

2242
01:53:05,536 --> 01:53:07,072

Jim Garrow a lot about the program

2248
01:53:19,872 --> 01:53:21,664
Communicated areas in China where he works

2249
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:25,760
I've made contact with orphanages in those areas and has been unable to substantiate

2250
01:53:26,016 --> 01:53:26,784

International

2254
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:49,824
Because

2255
01:53:50,336 --> 01:53:55,712
He's doing this s*** without the proper Authority on a very real and Technical level

2256
01:53:55,968 --> 01:53:56,992
The flip

2257
01:53:59,552 --> 01:54:05,184
Children out of China has quote in the buying and selling of babies

2258
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:14,144
Nobody knows who you are

2259
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:15,168
What

2260
01:54:15,424 --> 01:54:17,984
Properly registered as a charitable organization

2261
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:21,312
Not supposed to take in philanthropic donations

2262
01:54:21,824 --> 01:54:23,104
But that doesn't stop him from

2263
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:24,896
Listening donations

2264
01:54:27,712 --> 01:54:30,016
He's claimed to pick Pagoda his

2265
01:54:30,272 --> 01:54:31,808

Dollars in Spanish

2267
01:54:33,344 --> 01:54:34,368
Pictures over the

2268
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:36,928
And that the money came from running an importing

2269
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:39,232
Particularly of Tim Horton's Coffee

2270
01:54:41,024 --> 01:54:42,048
Alexandra cycle

2271
01:54:42,304 --> 01:54:44,864
Quotes girl has no affiliation with the company

2272
01:54:47,424 --> 01:54:49,472
He's definitely not authorized and not licensed

2273
01:54:49,728 --> 01:54:50,496
To sell our products

2274
01:54:50,752 --> 01:54:56,384
So I guess we can add smuggling to his resume

2275
01:54:56,640 --> 01:54:59,200
30 adopted Chinese children

2276
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:05,600
Hey come on board with Pagoda as their legal advice

2277
01:55:06,368 --> 01:55:07,648
Weather report

2278
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:09,440
Never been involved

2279
01:55:09,696 --> 01:55:11,744
Pink Bogota and I have no idea

2280
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:15,840
Malaysian I'm really mad at this guy

2281
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:18,912
That's a little bit of an understatement

2282
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:22,496
Jim Carroll going to write a book about his work with Agoda

2283
01:55:23,008 --> 01:55:24,288
One of the people who wrote

2284
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:26,080
For him included in the book

2285
01:55:26,336 --> 01:55:27,360
It's part of the book

2286
01:55:27,616 --> 01:55:28,128
What is endorsement

2287
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:34,784
One is none other than our old friend

2288
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:41,440
Cuz I put the helfrich fingers at everybody

2289
01:55:41,696 --> 01:55:47,840
This one interesting

2290
01:55:48,096 --> 01:55:49,632
Division published Gyros book

2291
01:55:53,984 --> 01:55:55,008
It is

2292
01:55:58,080 --> 01:55:59,872
I read a review this book that I can only

2293
01:56:00,128 --> 01:56:00,640
Only describe

2294
01:56:00,896 --> 01:56:03,456
There was posted on the research China vlog

2295
01:56:03,712 --> 01:56:05,760
Run by helping

2296
01:56:06,272 --> 01:56:06,784
The stories of the

2297
01:56:08,064 --> 01:56:09,344
So as to help them create a folder

2298
01:56:09,856 --> 01:56:10,880
Themselves as they grow up

2299
01:56:11,392 --> 01:56:12,928
The book is described as a

2300
01:56:14,208 --> 01:56:15,744
Stereotypes about Chinese culture which

2301
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:17,280
Quotes

2302
01:56:17,536 --> 01:56:19,328
He was watching a predictable movie

2303
01:56:20,096 --> 01:56:21,376
Darrow's view of China

2304
01:56:21,632 --> 01:56:22,656
Describe this quote

2305
01:56:22,912 --> 01:56:24,960
Simplify

2306
01:56:25,216 --> 01:56:25,728
Familiar

2307
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:27,520
The book is devoid of any

2308
01:56:27,776 --> 01:56:29,312
Discussion of the specifics of how adoption

2309
01:56:31,616 --> 01:56:33,664
It seems like that's not a stylistic choice

2310
01:56:34,176 --> 01:56:40,320
It appears that Garrow does not even know the forms that are required to complete the process of bring the child into the country

2311
01:56:40,576 --> 01:56:44,160
You want some candy

2312
01:56:44,416 --> 01:56:46,208
It's only made worse by four

2313
01:56:46,464 --> 01:56:47,232
Protracted action

2314
01:56:47,744 --> 01:56:53,888
The book where where Gyros Chinese intelligence operative friend who he calls Yoda

2315
01:56:54,144 --> 01:56:57,216
Commits a bunch of murders to protect Garrow and his mission to save children

2316
01:56:57,472 --> 01:56:58,240
The whole thing

2317
01:56:58,496 --> 01:57:02,080
Is ridiculous now I want to read this book

2318
01:57:02,336 --> 01:57:02,848
Because

2319
01:57:03,104 --> 01:57:04,640
Tom Clancy

2320
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:10,784
There's a really good girls never been arrested for child trafficking

2321
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:13,344
Operate

2322
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:14,112
Because you just make me

2323
01:57:16,672 --> 01:57:17,696
As we like

2324
01:57:17,952 --> 01:57:22,304
About us laughing about this

2325
01:57:22,816 --> 01:57:28,960
Yeah I think he's just lying about all day

2326
01:57:29,472 --> 01:57:34,080
That doesn't there's there's not a

2327
01:57:34,336 --> 01:57:34,848
There's not a

2328
01:57:35,104 --> 01:57:36,384
Goodchild

2329
01:57:40,224 --> 01:57:43,808
Journalist who tried to contact any of the school's orphanages and claims associate

2330
01:57:45,344 --> 01:57:47,392
Unable to find any proof

2331
01:57:47,648 --> 01:57:49,440
And end up just dialing phone numbers that lead

2332
01:57:51,744 --> 01:57:52,512
Daryl did get arrest

2333
01:57:53,792 --> 01:57:55,840
A light 2014 us

2334
01:57:56,096 --> 01:57:58,400
We all assumed we were getting to an arrest record

2335
01:57:58,656 --> 01:57:59,424
Could sooner or later

2336
01:57:59,936 --> 01:58:01,984
In late 2014 was arrested in quote

2337
01:58:02,240 --> 01:58:07,360
Is charges of unauthorized possession of a firearm possession of a firearm possession of

2338
01:58:08,896 --> 01:58:09,664
Storage of a firearm

2339
01:58:10,432 --> 01:58:13,248
As is the case with everyone who Alex hangs out with Gary

2340
01:58:13,504 --> 01:58:15,040
Immediately claimed you would set up

2341
01:58:15,296 --> 01:58:16,576
Is probably Obama Bhai

2342
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:18,880
I can't find out

2343
01:58:19,392 --> 01:58:20,160
Nation about the outcome

2344
01:58:20,416 --> 01:58:22,976
Severe

2345
01:58:23,232 --> 01:58:25,792
And afterwards he'd spill all over right-wing media

2346
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:29,376
So this is

2347
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:31,424
Anybody

2348
01:58:34,496 --> 01:58:35,008
About

2349
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:36,288
Other culture

2350
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:38,080
Would probably look at him be like

2351
01:58:38,592 --> 01:58:39,616
What the f***

2352
01:58:41,664 --> 01:58:43,456
Because if he doesn't do any

2353
01:58:43,712 --> 01:58:44,224
It's work

2354
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:45,248
Then

2355
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:54,464
Because it's illegal you're not actually

2356
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:55,744
To get a child

2357
01:59:05,216 --> 01:59:05,728
Super busy

2358
01:59:05,984 --> 01:59:08,800
If someone comes to you and says you took my child you know that you didn't

2359
01:59:09,056 --> 01:59:13,920
Yeah it's kind of a really great skin

2360
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:18,272
They tried to scam the scammer

2361
01:59:18,528 --> 01:59:22,880
$40,000

2362
01:59:23,392 --> 01:59:25,440
I don't I don't know

2363
01:59:25,696 --> 01:59:26,464
Like a pretty good

2364
01:59:27,488 --> 01:59:28,256
I mean it's a terrible

2365
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:31,328
If you're someone like

2366
01:59:31,584 --> 01:59:32,096
Kim

2367
01:59:32,608 --> 01:59:33,632
It seems pretty women

2368
01:59:34,144 --> 01:59:36,704
Yeah if you are of great

2369
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:37,984
Humanitarianism

2370
01:59:38,752 --> 01:59:39,776
Get a lot of people

2371
01:59:40,544 --> 01:59:41,824
I think a lot of people are

2372
01:59:42,848 --> 01:59:43,360
He seems

2373
01:59:43,872 --> 01:59:45,152
I can story is full of holes

2374
01:59:45,664 --> 01:59:46,432
His careers

2375
01:59:46,688 --> 01:59:47,200
Full of bulls

2376
01:59:47,456 --> 01:59:47,968
Fraud

2377
01:59:48,224 --> 01:59:49,248
Also I didn't even get into

2378
01:59:49,504 --> 01:59:50,016
This stuff

2379
01:59:50,272 --> 01:59:51,296
He is like an educator

2380
01:59:53,856 --> 01:59:55,648
In his backstory

2381
01:59:56,928 --> 01:59:57,952
Mercury

2382
01:59:58,208 --> 02:00:00,512
Article in the number of incidents

2383
02:00:01,024 --> 02:00:05,376
Running the school or the teacher to school and then people in the area

2384
02:00:05,632 --> 02:00:06,912
They remember him leaving

2385
02:00:10,240 --> 02:00:10,752
Seems like there's

2386
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:22,784
Kind of vibe go Motown

2387
02:00:25,088 --> 02:00:26,624
Problem

You got to give it up

2402
02:01:04,512 --> 02:01:05,792
A very similar thing for me

2403
02:01:08,352 --> 02:01:11,168
Anyway look can have two edges

2404
02:01:11,424 --> 02:01:15,520
On one Edge is child trafficking

2405
02:01:16,032 --> 02:01:16,544
For good

2406
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:18,080

And it was because

02:02:09,792 --> 02:02:11,072
A question was asked of him

Now I called it Alyssa

2430
02:02:13,376 --> 02:02:16,192
See what it is

2431
02:02:17,216 --> 02:02:20,032
Where the military was called upon to go

2432
02:02:20,288 --> 02:02:20,800
And confirm

2433
02:02:21,056 --> 02:02:22,336
People who were armed

2434
02:02:22,848 --> 02:02:25,408
American citizens who would not relinquish

2435
02:02:26,688 --> 02:02:29,504
In spite of the Second Amendment right to hold arm

2436
02:02:30,016 --> 02:02:31,040
Atwood you

2437
02:02:31,296 --> 02:02:33,088
Fire on American citizens

2438
02:02:33,600 --> 02:02:37,696
Related to me that the officer was total video

2439
02:02:38,976 --> 02:02:39,744
He would be asked

2440
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:40,512
Question

2441
02:02:40,768 --> 02:02:44,608
And he said that his answer was no I would not fire on America

2442
02:02:52,032 --> 02:02:56,640
That is amazing

2443
02:03:13,792 --> 02:03:14,304
The hero

2444
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:16,352
In the military

2445
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:17,632
Situation here

2446
02:03:25,824 --> 02:03:27,872
He's trying to imply

2447
02:03:28,128 --> 02:03:30,688
It's most important story

2448
02:03:30,944 --> 02:03:31,968
Is related

2449
02:03:32,224 --> 02:03:33,248
Ruag a metallic

2450
02:03:33,504 --> 02:03:38,880
Telling you the story that I heard from a former officer

2451
02:03:39,136 --> 02:03:40,416
From a guy he encouraged

2452
02:03:40,672 --> 02:03:41,440
To join the military

2453
02:03:42,208 --> 02:03:42,976
Gato it's

2454
02:03:43,232 --> 02:03:44,256
It's real thin

2455
02:03:45,536 --> 02:03:46,048
So far

2456
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:52,704
Get into it because

2457
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:54,752
The household name

2458
02:03:55,008 --> 02:03:56,288
And he will not

2459
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:57,824
Becoming popcorn popper

2460
02:03:58,592 --> 02:04:02,432
This man is a legend yes you would know his name every American with no

2461
02:04:02,688 --> 02:04:04,992
And no he will not be coming

2462
02:04:07,552 --> 02:04:10,624
He thought that the best thing he could do is

2463
02:04:11,136 --> 02:04:13,184
I was honored that he called me

2464
02:04:13,952 --> 02:04:14,464
But you didn't call you

2465
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:22,144
General Mad Dog Mattis

2466
02:04:23,424 --> 02:04:23,936
A command

2467
02:04:24,448 --> 02:04:26,752
What if Obama tried to get mad

2468
02:04:27,008 --> 02:04:27,520
Civilians

2469
02:04:27,776 --> 02:04:29,312
And he being a Mad Dog

2470
02:04:29,568 --> 02:04:30,336
You said no sir

2471
02:04:31,104 --> 02:04:33,152
Was drummed out of the service

2472
02:04:33,408 --> 02:04:34,432
Case closed

2473
02:04:35,200 --> 02:04:35,712
The problem is

2474
02:04:35,968 --> 02:04:38,016
Jim Mattis announced his resignation in April

2475
02:04:38,272 --> 02:04:40,064
2012

2476
02:04:40,576 --> 02:04:43,392
Neither Obama told Madison needed to shoot on civilians

2477
02:04:43,904 --> 02:04:45,184
Known Obama said okay

2478
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:47,744
Keep you around for 11 months while we try to find a replacement

2479
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:49,792
Meanwhile Battleship serving the president

2480
02:04:50,048 --> 02:04:50,560
You do is try to

2481
02:04:50,816 --> 02:04:51,328
Kill paper

2482
02:04:51,584 --> 02:04:53,120
Or

2483
02:04:53,632 --> 02:04:55,168
4 Mattis resign

2484
02:04:55,680 --> 02:04:58,752
And then Obama

2485
02:04:59,264 --> 02:05:00,032
I'm not sure exactly

2486
02:05:00,544 --> 02:05:03,616
Removing mobile.

2487
02:05:04,128 --> 02:05:04,640
Mic drop

2488
02:05:05,152 --> 02:05:08,224
This is the only high-profile military resignation around

2489
02:05:10,528 --> 02:05:11,040
Comply

2490
02:05:11,296 --> 02:05:12,064
Is the person who stalked

2491
02:05:13,088 --> 02:05:13,856
He knows better than to be

2492
02:05:14,112 --> 02:05:15,904
Pacific

2493
02:05:16,160 --> 02:05:16,672
Madison

2494
02:05:16,928 --> 02:05:18,208
Nation was because he

2495
02:05:18,720 --> 02:05:19,488
See eye-to-eye on Madison

2496
02:05:21,536 --> 02:05:23,072
Also matters join the Marines the 19

2497
02:05:23,584 --> 02:05:25,632
69

2498
02:05:26,144 --> 02:05:26,912
Madison

2499
02:05:27,168 --> 02:05:27,936
The oldest ship

2500
02:05:28,448 --> 02:05:28,960
Madden 16

2501
02:05:29,984 --> 02:05:30,752
Retired

2502
02:05:31,776 --> 02:05:32,800
Hey wife

2503
02:05:33,056 --> 02:05:37,664
This is just another fraud being carried out by this frog guy

2504
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:40,480
It's right

2505
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:43,808
But he's not going

2506
02:05:49,952 --> 02:05:50,720
So Alex knows

2507
02:06:04,544 --> 02:06:06,848
It's Boykin

2508
02:06:12,224 --> 02:06:13,504
Sheboygan

2509
02:06:17,856 --> 02:06:18,624
Which is stupid

2510
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:20,416
Because retirement

2511
02:06:20,672 --> 02:06:21,184
2007

2512
02:06:22,464 --> 02:06:22,976
Even took office

2513
02:06:23,488 --> 02:06:24,768
So we wouldn't

2514
02:06:25,024 --> 02:06:27,584
2013

2515
02:06:28,352 --> 02:06:30,400
Also in 2013

2516
02:06:30,656 --> 02:06:31,168
Was employed at

2517
02:06:31,424 --> 02:06:33,216
Executive Vice President of the family research

2518
02:06:33,728 --> 02:06:39,872
F****** God

2519
02:06:43,712 --> 02:06:44,736
Information

2520
02:06:44,992 --> 02:06:46,272
Real piece of s***

2521
02:06:46,784 --> 02:06:50,112
Unfortunately we don't have time to get into him today but I'm sure he'll show up as a gas

2522
02:06:51,136 --> 02:06:51,648
Alex

2523
02:06:51,904 --> 02:06:56,768
ProSource

2524
02:06:57,024 --> 02:06:57,792
Into some sort of us

2525
02:06:58,304 --> 02:06:58,816
Yeah

2526
02:07:00,096 --> 02:07:01,632
This interview goes

2527
02:07:02,656 --> 02:07:03,168
Alex

2528
02:07:03,680 --> 02:07:04,192
Love's

2529
02:07:05,728 --> 02:07:09,824
I don't think the two of them has ever spoken before and they are fast friends

2530
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:11,104
Mostly because

2531
02:07:11,616 --> 02:07:12,896
Garrow is reinforcing

2532
02:07:13,152 --> 02:07:14,432
Sing all the things that Alex

2533
02:07:14,688 --> 02:07:16,480
Yeah that's about

2534
02:07:16,736 --> 02:07:17,760
He does the steeper

2535
02:07:18,016 --> 02:07:18,784
Move

2536
02:07:19,040 --> 02:07:20,320
Really over flattering

2537
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:23,392
I need to talk to you today

2538
02:07:23,648 --> 02:07:24,416
You know

2539
02:07:24,928 --> 02:07:26,464
You are right on about all this

2540
02:07:29,792 --> 02:07:30,304
Hitler Youth

2541
02:07:30,816 --> 02:07:31,328
Ready

2542
02:07:32,096 --> 02:07:34,912
Replace these old generals

2543
02:07:35,424 --> 02:07:37,728
Okay

2544
02:07:39,008 --> 02:07:39,520
Excited

2545
02:07:39,776 --> 02:07:40,800
This guy is on the same

2546
02:07:42,336 --> 02:07:44,640
The right answer to this

2547
02:07:44,896 --> 02:07:47,712
They got a whole Army of young kids who don't know any better

2548
02:07:47,968 --> 02:07:48,992
Ready-to-move-in

2549
02:07:49,248 --> 02:07:50,016
And keep in mind

2550
02:07:50,272 --> 02:07:52,320
Who are the people who get away with

2551
02:07:52,576 --> 02:07:56,672
In the despotic times who were the ones that they rely on Indiana

2552
02:08:15,616 --> 02:08:17,408
Exactly where here's the Hitler Youth

2553
02:08:18,176 --> 02:08:19,200
Resurrected

2554
02:08:19,456 --> 02:08:19,968
Now

2555
02:08:20,224 --> 02:08:22,016
Under this name of Obamacare that's

2556
02:08:37,632 --> 02:08:38,656
If you think it's William Boyd

2557
02:08:40,192 --> 02:08:40,704
Amanda

2558
02:08:42,496 --> 02:08:43,264
Excitement

2559
02:08:43,776 --> 02:08:44,544
It was not.

2560
02:08:45,824 --> 02:08:49,152
Hello tushy

2561
02:08:49,408 --> 02:08:52,224
No more frequently

2562
02:08:52,480 --> 02:08:54,016
And maybe go get coffee

2563
02:08:55,552 --> 02:09:00,160
New friendship developed that part is me

2564
02:09:00,416 --> 02:09:02,720
So you didn't actually say that

2565
02:09:02,976 --> 02:09:05,792
Friendship is

2566
02:09:06,048 --> 02:09:07,072
Solidified

2567
02:09:07,328 --> 02:09:08,352
And he leave

2568
02:09:08,864 --> 02:09:10,656
And then Alex goes into overdrive

2569
02:09:11,168 --> 02:09:12,704
Has Melissa Melton

2570
02:09:13,472 --> 02:09:14,496
I'm sorry

2571
02:09:14,752 --> 02:09:16,800
Eclipse it is but it does

2572
02:09:17,312 --> 02:09:20,384
Comes in as a guest

2573
02:09:22,432 --> 02:09:27,552
It's absurd

2574
02:09:27,808 --> 02:09:28,320
Spectate

2575
02:09:28,576 --> 02:09:29,344
Kind of unsatisfied

2576
02:09:30,624 --> 02:09:31,392
Just saying

2577
02:09:31,904 --> 02:09:36,768
How much control

2578
02:09:37,024 --> 02:09:42,656
Over and over

2579
02:09:46,240 --> 02:09:47,264
Aunt

2580
02:09:47,776 --> 02:09:49,824
Thoughts keep bringing up

2581
02:09:50,336 --> 02:09:50,848
Alex

2582
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:53,920
Even if I had a thousand guns and I was in the woods

2583
02:09:54,176 --> 02:09:55,456
Fortified position

2584
02:09:55,712 --> 02:09:56,480
If those drones

2585
02:09:56,736 --> 02:10:01,088
Oh, the military is going to be able to

2586
02:10:01,344 --> 02:10:02,880
Really going to make that much of a difference

2587
02:10:03,648 --> 02:10:06,720
I don't

2588
02:10:06,976 --> 02:10:07,488
I thought like

2589
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:12,864
When Alex said where can I be on parking garage and it's going to be alright have a comment

2590
02:10:13,376 --> 02:10:13,888
This is

2591
02:10:15,168 --> 02:10:17,216
It's ultimately not that crazy

2592
02:10:17,472 --> 02:10:18,752
Never boring interview

2593
02:10:19,008 --> 02:10:23,360
Reject right this is more complicated

2594
02:10:23,616 --> 02:10:24,896
And then finding points

2595
02:10:25,152 --> 02:10:26,176
Agreement and I drank

2596
02:10:26,688 --> 02:10:27,456
Find Alex that

2597
02:10:27,968 --> 02:10:28,480
What do you believe

2598
02:10:28,992 --> 02:10:29,760
It's stupid

2599
02:10:33,344 --> 02:10:36,160
You can go find it on YouTube if you want to listen to that interview

2600
02:10:36,416 --> 02:10:37,440
I just didn't think there was much

2601
02:10:37,696 --> 02:10:39,488
Worthwhile there

2602
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:40,768
Merrilee Rush

2603
02:10:42,048 --> 02:10:43,072
Appearing on the showing

2604
02:10:43,328 --> 02:10:45,376
Trying to appeal to Alex on a

2605
02:10:45,632 --> 02:10:47,936
Not yelling at each other level

2606
02:10:48,192 --> 02:10:49,728
That doesn't make for good clips

2607
02:10:50,752 --> 02:10:51,264
Check that out if you

2608
02:10:51,776 --> 02:10:53,056
Alex Goes to Overdrive

2609
02:10:53,824 --> 02:10:54,848
Yes Melissa Melton

2610
02:10:55,104 --> 02:10:56,384
Who is one of his employees

2611
02:10:56,640 --> 02:10:57,664
Who has

2612
02:10:57,920 --> 02:10:59,968
XVideos

2613
02:11:00,224 --> 02:11:01,248
Yeah well

2614
02:11:01,504 --> 02:11:04,064
Yeah because

2615
02:11:05,344 --> 02:11:06,112
In college

2616
02:11:08,416 --> 02:11:09,440
+ 5

2617
02:11:09,952 --> 02:11:10,976
And they're trying

2618
02:11:11,232 --> 02:11:11,744
To argue

2619
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:12,512
Do that

2620
02:11:15,328 --> 02:11:16,352
Violent crime

2621
02:11:16,608 --> 02:11:17,120
Flooring

2622
02:11:17,376 --> 02:11:18,656
But there's a causal connection

2623
02:11:20,704 --> 02:11:21,728
Bring up with Jen

2624
02:11:23,264 --> 02:11:24,544
There are other factors.

2625
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:25,824
Consider that might be

2626
02:11:26,080 --> 02:11:28,128
Attributable it's not necessarily

2627
02:11:28,384 --> 02:11:29,152
That gun ownership

2628
02:11:29,408 --> 02:11:29,920
Pause that

2629
02:11:32,736 --> 02:11:34,528
Probably refutation to your argument

2630
02:11:37,856 --> 02:11:38,624
Concentrate

2631
02:11:40,160 --> 02:11:40,928
Is not falling

2632
02:11:43,232 --> 02:11:46,304
That's compared to

2633
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:47,328
Concealed carry

2634
02:11:48,864 --> 02:11:49,632
Head come out of

2635
02:11:51,936 --> 02:11:53,216
Alex's just taking

2636
02:11:54,240 --> 02:11:55,520
Some raw data from the app

2637
02:11:56,544 --> 02:11:57,312
And create

2638
02:11:57,568 --> 02:11:58,080
Conclusion

2639
02:11:58,336 --> 02:12:03,712
Which people on the right never twist

2640
02:12:03,968 --> 02:12:05,760
Statistics in order to make a bulge

2641
02:12:06,272 --> 02:12:09,344
Also talking about UK

2642
02:12:10,112 --> 02:12:14,976
Since they took

2643
02:12:15,232 --> 02:12:17,280
But

2644
02:12:18,816 --> 02:12:22,656
Call Brittany

2645
02:12:23,168 --> 02:12:24,960
Or higher

2646
02:12:25,216 --> 02:12:28,800
I believe Australia South Africa here

2647
02:12:30,336 --> 02:12:30,848
Britain

2648
02:12:31,360 --> 02:12:37,504
The violent crime compared to Northern Ireland

2649
02:12:39,296 --> 02:12:39,808
How do you say

2650
02:12:40,064 --> 02:12:40,832
Scotland

2651
02:12:44,416 --> 02:12:50,560
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland

2652
02:12:51,072 --> 02:12:53,376
South Africa in the United States

2653
02:12:54,656 --> 02:13:00,800
North America part of the UK of Great Britain

2654
02:13:01,056 --> 02:13:02,336
The United States

2655
02:13:02,592 --> 02:13:03,616
Canada

2656
02:13:03,872 --> 02:13:08,736
South Africa and New Zealand

2657
02:13:08,992 --> 02:13:10,016
Could be a slip

2658
02:13:14,880 --> 02:13:17,184
You don't think so

2659
02:13:18,464 --> 02:13:20,256
And also of course it is

2660
02:13:20,768 --> 02:13:22,304
It's London

2661
02:13:22,560 --> 02:13:23,328
I don't think that's what you

2662
02:13:25,888 --> 02:13:27,680
Britain is the violent crime capital of

2663
02:13:27,936 --> 02:13:28,448
You

2664
02:13:29,216 --> 02:13:31,264
That could be

2665
02:13:31,520 --> 02:13:34,336
Except that as a possibility

2666
02:13:34,848 --> 02:13:35,616
Specious

2667
02:13:36,128 --> 02:13:37,664
Poorly set

2668
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:41,760
Melissa

2669
02:13:42,016 --> 02:13:43,296
Talkingshit on Joe Biden

2670
02:13:43,808 --> 02:13:44,320
Which is

2671
02:13:45,344 --> 02:13:46,112
I guess whatever

2672
02:13:46,368 --> 02:13:46,880
Auto Care

2673
02:13:47,136 --> 02:13:52,256
I'm not going back to bed for Joe Biden

2674
02:13:53,024 --> 02:13:53,536
Disgraceful

2675
02:13:54,048 --> 02:13:55,072
Ambrose

2676
02:13:57,376 --> 02:13:57,888
The Press

2677
02:13:58,144 --> 02:14:00,704
Yeah

2678
02:14:04,288 --> 02:14:06,592
He talked about how these are kids that were just killed

2679
02:14:06,848 --> 02:14:07,872
They were riddled with bullet

2680
02:14:08,640 --> 02:14:09,152
And so Alex

2681
02:14:09,664 --> 02:14:10,176
Playing

2682
02:14:10,432 --> 02:14:10,944
Supercut of

2683
02:14:11,200 --> 02:14:12,224
Him saying riddled with bullet

2684
02:14:12,480 --> 02:14:14,528
What's aha

2685
02:14:15,296 --> 02:14:16,576
What about the bullets

2686
02:14:17,088 --> 02:14:17,600
God

2687
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:19,392
But

2688
02:14:19,648 --> 02:14:20,672
He doesn't weird Biden

2689
02:14:24,512 --> 02:14:25,024
Feed the trolls

2690
02:14:25,280 --> 02:14:27,840
You know I got to do in these wagons

2691
02:14:28,096 --> 02:14:30,400
Trolls cover it

2692
02:14:31,680 --> 02:14:32,192
Can you really get

2693
02:14:33,216 --> 02:14:33,728
Matter

2694
02:14:33,984 --> 02:14:34,496
About

2695
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:36,288
Supposed trolls

2696
02:14:37,312 --> 02:14:37,824
And he wants

2697
02:14:39,616 --> 02:14:40,640
This clip is our

2698
02:15:14,688 --> 02:15:18,272
Gun statistics

2699
02:15:18,528 --> 02:15:19,552
If you ever want

2700
02:15:20,064 --> 02:15:22,880
Is trolls

2701
02:15:25,184 --> 02:15:29,024
I'll be damned to hell

2702
02:15:29,792 --> 02:15:31,584
It's weird

2703
02:15:31,840 --> 02:15:32,352
Fillmore

2704
02:15:32,608 --> 02:15:35,168
I think part of it is probably just muscle

2705
02:15:35,680 --> 02:15:37,728
Daddy started down that road

2706
02:15:39,264 --> 02:15:41,568
Field madder than you probably

2707
02:15:44,128 --> 02:15:50,272
Personal

2708
02:15:50,528 --> 02:15:53,088
She was kind of non-committal

2709
02:15:53,344 --> 02:15:55,392
Welsh

2710
02:15:55,648 --> 02:15:57,440
Aggressively so

2711
02:15:57,696 --> 02:16:02,560
Must you go to how many more

2712
02:16:03,072 --> 02:16:04,096
Frozen lake in the knights

2713
02:16:04,864 --> 02:16:05,888
Absolute

2714
02:16:07,424 --> 02:16:09,216
We come to the end of this stretch

2715
02:16:10,752 --> 02:16:11,264
Because

2716
02:16:12,544 --> 02:16:13,824
That I expected are coming

2717
02:16:14,080 --> 02:16:15,104
Pass

2718
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:17,408
The prediction that after Alex

2719
02:16:17,664 --> 02:16:18,176
Had

2720
02:16:18,432 --> 02:16:19,712
Paul Joseph Watson work correctly

2721
02:16:22,272 --> 02:16:23,296
And they recognized

2722
02:16:23,808 --> 02:16:24,320
Value

2723
02:16:25,344 --> 02:16:26,368
Sandy Hook conspiracy

2724
02:16:27,136 --> 02:16:28,672
More aggressive

2725
02:16:29,184 --> 02:16:29,696
Market

2726
02:16:30,464 --> 02:16:31,232
His behavior

2727
02:16:31,488 --> 02:16:32,768
In the aftermath

2728
02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:33,792
They literally

2729
02:16:35,328 --> 02:16:36,864
Of the Lone Star College shooting

2730
02:16:37,120 --> 02:16:37,632
Indicates

2731
02:16:38,656 --> 02:16:39,680
A few days after

2732
02:16:39,936 --> 02:16:42,752
All the talk about how popular videos

2733
02:16:44,288 --> 02:16:45,056
See that is kind of

2734
02:16:45,824 --> 02:16:47,616
Pretty strong indication that

2735
02:16:48,384 --> 02:16:49,920
Wanting to get into that market

2736
02:16:51,712 --> 02:16:54,016
Whenever there's any kind of a shooting brake

2737
02:16:54,272 --> 02:16:55,296
Alex try to behave

2738
02:16:56,320 --> 02:16:56,832
I think

2739
02:16:57,088 --> 02:16:57,856
He's going to lose her

2740
02:16:58,112 --> 02:16:59,136
His mine

2741
02:16:59,648 --> 02:17:00,416
That constant

2742
02:17:00,672 --> 02:17:01,184
Chase for the

2743
02:17:01,440 --> 02:17:01,952
Proof of the Earth

2744
02:17:02,208 --> 02:17:03,232
The fakeness

2745
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,560
And you know what I got that's a sentence that is so

2746
02:17:06,816 --> 02:17:10,912
People outside of our world

2747
02:17:11,936 --> 02:17:13,216
He's looking for constant

2748
02:17:13,472 --> 02:17:15,008
Proof of this

2749
02:17:17,056 --> 02:17:19,616
What are you

2750
02:17:22,432 --> 02:17:23,456
Called working yourself

2751
02:17:24,736 --> 02:17:27,808
Where at

2752
02:17:28,064 --> 02:17:31,136
You're faking

2753
02:17:31,392 --> 02:17:32,672
But sometimes people get

2754
02:17:34,208 --> 02:17:36,000
It's so aggressively that it becomes real

2755
02:17:40,864 --> 02:17:42,144
Kind of doing that now

2756
02:17:43,680 --> 02:17:44,448
Process of

2757
02:17:45,472 --> 02:17:45,984
Capitalize

2758
02:17:47,264 --> 02:17:47,776
On this

2759
02:17:49,056 --> 02:17:50,336
The profitability of

2760
02:17:51,616 --> 02:17:52,896
He's going to end up in a shoe

2761
02:18:01,088 --> 02:18:01,600
I think

2762
02:18:03,392 --> 02:18:06,464
Siri right now

2763
02:18:06,976 --> 02:18:08,256
I think he accidentally

2764
02:18:10,048 --> 02:18:12,352
Too far in

2765
02:18:13,632 --> 02:18:15,424
We got into that territory where those comp

2766
02:18:18,240 --> 02:18:19,776
He just kept going like

2767
02:18:20,032 --> 02:18:21,312
So much of my time

2768
02:18:23,360 --> 02:18:26,176
I get so much more excited and it's so much more.

2769
02:18:29,504 --> 02:18:30,016
Reinforced

2770
02:18:30,528 --> 02:18:31,296
Audience

2771
02:18:31,808 --> 02:18:32,832
Many people say

2772
02:18:33,088 --> 02:18:34,112
You got to tell the

2773
02:18:38,208 --> 02:18:39,232
Hello

2774
02:18:41,280 --> 02:18:41,792
Really

2775
02:18:44,864 --> 02:18:45,632
Trouble

2776
02:18:49,472 --> 02:18:50,496
Trouble

2777
02:18:50,752 --> 02:18:53,312
I can't get over how fascinated I have but how

2778
02:18:53,568 --> 02:18:55,104
How badly this is going to go

2779
02:18:55,872 --> 02:18:56,384
I mean

2780
02:18:56,896 --> 02:18:58,944
The prediction that I had on the last episode

2781
02:18:59,200 --> 02:18:59,712
Ickey Woods

2782
02:18:59,968 --> 02:19:00,480
Start getting in

2783
02:19:00,736 --> 02:19:01,248
Into this business

2784
02:19:01,504 --> 02:19:05,344
A bit more before I listen to that episode with Lonestar

2785
02:19:05,600 --> 02:19:07,392
College shooting

2786
02:19:07,648 --> 02:19:11,744
Text David he's back in after his vacation

2787
02:19:12,256 --> 02:19:13,536
That's the angle he take

2788
02:19:14,048 --> 02:19:14,816
It

2789
02:19:16,608 --> 02:19:18,144
Suggested

2790
02:19:18,400 --> 02:19:20,192
Very very rare production

2791
02:19:22,752 --> 02:19:23,520
But if we got to get

2792
02:19:23,776 --> 02:19:24,288
It worries

2793
02:19:24,800 --> 02:19:26,336
I might I might be at

2794
02:19:28,384 --> 02:19:28,896
Real hard.

2795
02:19:29,408 --> 02:19:30,176
You know it

2796
02:19:32,480 --> 02:19:33,760
Relatives

2797
02:19:34,272 --> 02:19:37,088
Because he was so far under the radar

2798
02:19:37,344 --> 02:19:37,856
Back in 2003

2799
02:19:41,440 --> 02:19:42,464
Even more damning

2800
02:19:51,936 --> 02:19:53,216
Eva

2801
02:19:54,752 --> 02:19:55,264
He did say that

2802
02:19:55,520 --> 02:19:56,032
The Wreckers

2803
02:19:57,824 --> 02:19:58,336
Provide the

2804
02:19:58,592 --> 02:20:01,152
Preceded that light him down that road

2805
02:20:01,408 --> 02:20:01,920
It makes it

2806
02:20:02,176 --> 02:20:04,224
Even worse

2807
02:20:04,480 --> 02:20:04,992
Being there

2808
02:20:05,504 --> 02:20:06,784
He recognized 10 points

2809
02:20:07,040 --> 02:20:07,552
6 million V

2810
02:20:07,808 --> 02:20:10,368
Reviews on this video and everyone is demanding

2811
02:20:18,048 --> 02:20:21,376
Psychological evaluation

2812
02:20:21,632 --> 02:20:22,912
Is mentally fit

2813
02:20:23,168 --> 02:20:23,936
