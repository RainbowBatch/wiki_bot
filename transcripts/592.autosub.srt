00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important swetik

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge B. I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
MoneyGram

4
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

5
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
Dot-com

6
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:05,024
Lean and talk a little bit about Alex

7
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,792
June

8
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,632
Giordano Giordano

9
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,264
Look I don't know a lot about a lot of thing or at

10
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,824
I know a lot about some very specific

11
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:24,480
Specialist you're not a squirrel

12
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:25,504
All things that I'm unaware of

13
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,368
And I believe is on our last episode I mentioned that I was starting to play like a deck building game

14
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:35,488
Yes indeed you should try Magic the Gathering

15
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,768
Cuz there's a way you

16
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,816
Can play it on a computer

17
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,352
I didn't know

18
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,888
I wear underwear

19
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:45,216
Me too I didn't know that thing existed

20
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,240
And

21
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,008
I started

22
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:55,712
Goodbye you roped me into this s*** to you dickwad

23
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:58,016
It's been a couple days of like

24
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,296
You going to dabbling around

25
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,160
I don't really know what I'm doing exactly

26
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:04,928
Because it was demonic

27
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,488
Scratching a lot of inches

28
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,792
It's scratching a lot of inches of the like

29
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,840
Card collecting

30
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:17,728
The sort of bizarre magical things of course of course creatures

31
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:22,080
Are you love Byzantine rules basically like logic puzzles

32
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:25,920
In a game for because there's so many conditional things about like

33
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:29,248
You can only play this if and only if these

34
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,528
Conditions are mad

35
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,296
Yeah

36
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:37,696
It's it it does tickle that a little bit

37
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:39,744
It's like a it's like a

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,584
You've just had more imagination and you didn't know what the other player had

39
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,864
Yeah

40
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,728
Yeah it also is really making me feel a little bit of like this reclaimed

41
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:50,752
Stuff from

42
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:53,312
When I was younger the stuff that I wasn't allowed to play

43
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:58,944
Eminem you know it makes me realize that I was also the one who decided to accept that rule when I was younger

44
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,088
I couldn't play it but I can't

45
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,880
We are playing another kind of wish I had

46
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:09,440
That's really cool that I could be online that doesn't make a mess

47
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,720
What is my house worth

48
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,024
Yeah that yeah that could be real trouble

49
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:19,936
Considering the number of Magic the Gathering cards there are if you got to Intuit this whole place

50
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:26,336
To be f***** it's over on it so I don't lose

51
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:29,408
Myself into the Otherworld

52
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,688
Of playing that

53
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:37,088
I'm struggling we played one match after I dragged her and you murdered me so bad

54
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,136
But now I'm like in the back of my head I'm like

55
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,672
Don't get too into it

56
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:43,744
It's not that big a deal I know there's a part of me is like

57
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:50,400
The next time you played and you better beat the s*** out of him or your dad's never going to love you I'm never going to play you again just so you can't

58
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:54,752
Appreciate

59
00:03:56,544 --> 00:04:00,128
Great and I appreciate the people who recommended that and

60
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,176
To basically inform me that it exists

61
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,200
Cuz I had no idea

62
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:03,968
Well done

63
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:09,344
My bright spot it could be I could go with that cuz I have course

64
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,880
Began dabbling as well

65
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:17,536
Said I'm going to go with be under spoken about album that has just been released it

66
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,559
Very good

67
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,327
Is churches

68
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,119
Churches Olivia

69
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:21,887
Fantastic

70
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:25,983
Do like them quite a bit

71
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:32,383
A couple of standouts and then you got roberts-smith Gaston what being a sad boy for a yeah

72
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,783
Simpson sad boys that's what you should have named the album summer

73
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:42,367
I also why were the topic of new albums

74
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:48,767
Do you have the rapper iodine gives a new album called a little above Loki

75
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:52,607
Listen to it enough

76
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,887
Till I fully Digest

77
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,191
And have strong opinions

78
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,471
2 hour but I enjoyed

79
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,263
Manziel

80
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,543
To go take that up to the lawn

81
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:06,175
Overwriting Spotify

82
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:13,343
Sue Jordan today we have an episode where we're going to go back into the past again

83
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:18,207
The reason is I just need to put Alex on timeout and while I was doing that

84
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,255
I just I felt like I was

85
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,047
Falling down a mountain

86
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:25,887
Like just like or a staircase hit mystere over and over

87
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,263
Superfund

88
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,079
Honest-to-god

89
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,103
I didn't sign up to

90
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,127
Do an anti vaxxer

91
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,919
Podcast

92
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,943
Hahaha

93
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,247
That is the one thing that I really didn't want

94
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,271
What is podcast

95
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:46,367
I didn't I didn't sign up when we started doing the show to talk about

96
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,903
Bizarre and stupid

97
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,463
Conspiracies about vaccinations every single

98
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,743
Go around

99
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:56,351
Otherwise I would have started a podcast about like Robert Kennedy Jr or something

100
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,375
You know into

101
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,143
I just

102
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,167
Why president stuff is

103
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:02,239
The bomber was trying to find anything that

104
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:06,079
Could be another angle and I came up with a pretty decent angle that I thought

105
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:06,847
Would be

106
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,151
Teachable and interesting

107
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:12,223
And that is to go over an episode of somebody else

108
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,247
Talkin about

109
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:17,343
Alex interesting interesting okay

110
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,879
The ways that you can

111
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,903
Highlight

112
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:24,255
Unawareness but other people have when they comment on Alan right

113
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,559
Right Right Alright transparent

114
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,143
Poison which they falling for the tricks that Alex

115
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:35,007
This is an evolution of our how not to cover Alex Jones series

116
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,031
Snapchat

117
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,335
And so I want to do that I put a bit of time at

118
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,663
Couldn't get over the hurdle of feeling like

119
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:48,319
I'm being a huge a****** to these people really feel like before you even said it I was like oh no we're going to be dicks.

120
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:52,671
These people I don't want to be mean kind of impossible to do that without putting

121
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:53,695
Specific

122
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:57,791
Person on blast Yahoo maybe is certainly

123
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:01,631
Small YouTube channel to give you a performing

124
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,167
Prince review exactly

125
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,727
I think there are things that you can learn from it and I think the

126
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:09,055
I need to find a better way to present that information that doesn't involve Kik

127
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:12,383
Taking some small YouTube channel is it just feels dirty

128
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:17,759
We got a we got to do some blind

129
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,087
It was a a Time sink

130
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,367
Yeah for me

131
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,159
And then of course

132
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:29,023
All my all my efforts and everything get interrupted by Joe Rogan getting

133
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,839
A fuking idiot

134
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:38,239
So Alex is pretty thrilled that Joe Rogan got covid and he cured himself with Ivermectin

135
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:41,055
Yep that sounds about like how it went

136
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:46,943
Yeah I think that people are really missing the forest for the trees on that story when they reporting that he took Ivermectin

137
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,271
Because he says a laundry list of things he took

138
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,575
Yeah he said he threw the kitchen sink at it

139
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:55,647
Doug z-pack you bought a quadrilateral antibodies

140
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,463
The prednisone

141
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:01,023
But he was taking tons and tons of stuff

142
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,583
So let's say that any of that help

143
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:07,167
That's my purse of the Ivermectin helped at all

144
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,983
I think that's the funny thing about science

145
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,775
Is that you can't draw

146
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,543
Conclusion

147
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,567
Unless you

148
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,615
Isolated the variable

149
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,919
If they were just get there going to do it's like

150
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,199
A study and they were like

151
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,503
Let's just give this group a bunch of s***

152
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,575
And then let's say give this group a bunch of different shapes

153
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,111
That would not have learned any

154
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:26,879
Anything no

155
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:29,183
No it won't be two different groups of s***

156
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:34,303
We can maybe make some wild speculation about

157
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,583
These different piles

158
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,679
Do people has better that Pilots yet sure

159
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:43,519
Maybe when we do it again it'll just be a different file s***

160
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:49,407
He took all this stuff and one of the things was Ivermectin and it just made me think of like okay

161
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,175
Yeah

162
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,711
I had an infection so I

163
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,479
I took like

164
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,503
Some antibiotics

165
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:54,783
And also a gummy

166
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,903
Total yeah that sounds about right

167
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,951
I don't know

168
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,999
Cena this is why this

169
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,791
What we missed

170
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,583
Was a real opportunity

171
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:11,167
To find out if hallucinogenics would cure covid

172
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:15,519
That's our control experiment for this if Joe Rogan

173
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,287
Gets

174
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,823
Covid he doesn't get to take

175
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:21,407
Any regular medication

176
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,687
Just rooms

177
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,711
That's what he's

178
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:30,623
If only he had a commitment to the public health but the science

179
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,951
What we're here for

180
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:42,143
You know trying to prepare an episode and I see a headline Joe Rogan has covid

181
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:46,495
Woohoo

182
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,079
Didn't see this coming

183
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:50,847
That's today

184
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,127
Alright

185
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,919
So I'm sure they'll learn a lot from this

186
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:56,223
This and that

187
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,015
Everything will be fine

188
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,575
Hahaha

189
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,135
I've no interest

190
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,951
Ms the most sarcastic

191
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:09,535
And devastating thing you can say to somebody knows just missing their budge

192
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,327
I just saying I'm sure they'll learn about

193
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,959
But next time this will go a lot smoother haha

194
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:20,799
Enzo all this all this world together and we are left with

195
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,079
June 12th

196
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,359
2003

197
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,639
June 12th 2003

198
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:30,527
On our last episode of 2003 Alex interview the guy who went to heaven

199
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,087
That is the day before this

200
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:33,855
Correct

201
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:34,879
So now he's back

202
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,647
Nubian real Siri

203
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,975
The day before the day we're about to speak of

204
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,023
We had a very serious

205
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,303
Home

206
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,327
And

207
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,095
Just

208
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,935
Discussion about what was in the waiting room to heaven

209
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:51,007
Yes and Alex allowed a guest

210
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,031
To discuss

211
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:55,103
How it's your snitch of an imaginary friend that you had

212
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,127
From childhood

213
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,175
And he did not push back on this light

214
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,479
So that means that I'm assuming that

215
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,759
Today I will be

216
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,551
Taking him very seriously

217
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:09,951
When he complains that the Bass party is still in charge of Iraq correct I will save there are no updates on the back party

218
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:11,743
Going

219
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,279
Exactly as they have been

220
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,559
On that front

221
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:18,399
But let's take a little moment say thanks

222
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:24,031
Send hello to some walks carsick thank you so much and I'll probably want

223
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,311
I'm a policy wonk

224
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:28,895
Thank you very much

225
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:33,759
Opening arguments

226
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,927
I'm a policy wonk

227
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,207
Andrew Bird

228
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:46,815
Liza's not a policy wonk but he plays one on patreon thank you so much right now apology want

229
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,679
Value play White

230
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:56,543
Say what up to so Ross beef

231
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,943
How's your 401k

232
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,783
What's the business

233
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,831
Money off that heroin

234
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,671
Large

235
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,607
Come to the family of Selena

236
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:27,007
On behalf of Matthew abroad to brought a tree kangaroo into the mix

237
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:30,591
Kangaroo in the tree or are they is it a type of tree

238
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,871
Depends on if it's

239
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,151
The animal or the magic

240
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:33,919
Jacquard

241
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,735
The tree Guru

242
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,015
Completely different

243
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,623
Restarting here after Alex stocks

244
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,159
About going to heaven

245
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:48,511
I mean I guess he's gotten back to Earth now

246
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,327
U.s. can't rule out

247
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,607
North Korea

248
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,663
North Korea

249
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,503
Reported story

250
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,903
On the border with North Korea

251
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:27,167
Alex's pretty preoccupied with the idea that we're going to go

252
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,215
Start a fight with North Korea

253
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:29,983
This point

254
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:34,079
Easy saying that this leak leaking of the battle plan is an attempt to get

255
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,103
Get them to attack

256
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:35,871
I got so weak

257
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,895
Can have a war with them

258
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,943
I'd like to point out that none of this

259
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,271
No.

260
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,039
But

261
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:43,807
That was

262
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:44,575
What's the plan

263
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,135
Right and I think there's a decent chance that be

264
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,695
Because Alex covered it on his show

265
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,487
He averted this

266
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,303
I mean I didn't hear anybody else

267
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,327
Think about it at the time

268
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,655
I can safely assume that

269
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:01,215
By talking about yeah it has been all Alex

270
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:04,799
Save the world once again

271
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:11,199
By himself this is a little bit you know I guess fear-mongering a little bit putting

272
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:14,015
Putting more into the the idea that we're going

273
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,831
Going to go to war with North Korea there

274
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,415
At least it's

275
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,695
Cut it like it's on Earth

276
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:28,095
The problem about when you introduce somebody who has been to heaven

277
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:31,423
And then the next day you're talking about war with North Korea

278
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:37,823
All I want to know is what does my imaginary friends think about war with North Korea because he's the one who's going to be keeping track

279
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,847
How I failed

280
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,383
Whenever I go to heaven

281
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,199
Why are we talkin about I think your imaginary friend is

282
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,223
Is against it

283
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:48,319
Then I can't go to war now can I guess you can

284
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,599
Yeah yeah

285
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:55,743
I also think there's a big difference between someone being like we're going to war until I'm saying like

286
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,791
All options are on the table

287
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,583
And when it's like Rumsfeld

288
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,375
Assistant or whatever

289
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:06,751
Anybody has reported on a mean to say

290
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:09,823
Report directory

291
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,615
So we got to

292
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:14,175
Unless I'm too along with heaven

293
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,223
And we got a little dose of monkey paw

294
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,015
Yes we did this

295
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,575
Is a preoccupation of Alex

296
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,367
Says oh my God

297
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,927
Gearbox

298
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,463
So much

299
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,519
99%

300
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,359
Medical workers

301
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,199
Now they seem

302
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:49,503
Everywhere

303
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:58,207
Well you just might have to have

304
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,999
So there was no attempt

305
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:03,839
Soar initiation program launched

306
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:07,423
To try and get the general public native for smallpox

307
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,191
In response

308
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:08,959
Monkeypox

309
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,751
They should have used Jeff Foxworthy

310
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,031
Because monkey talk

311
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:17,407
Wow that's not bad just might need a vaccine

312
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:21,247
Yeah the CDC advises that a very limited set of people get

313
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:24,063
Smallpox vaccine during this 2003 monkey pox outbreak

314
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:27,135
These people included people who investigated the monkeypox

315
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:29,439
Cases people who are in close contact with patient

316
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,207
You got it

317
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,487
And people that directors

318
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,279
Contact with an infected animal

319
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:39,935
The only way to make it look like an attempt to scare the masses of the public into getting smallpox vaccine is like completely lying about the details of the

320
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,215
Story in exaggerating

321
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,263
Ridiculously which is what Alex is doing

322
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,311
Yeah if your warning is like hey

323
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:48,639
Have you been around anybody with monkeypox recently or an in

324
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,663
Infected animal

325
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,711
Then get vaccine

326
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,271
You're fine

327
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,063
That's not scaremonger

328
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,111
That's just like a regular

329
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,415
There's a flood around

330
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,207
If you're nearby where the flood is half

331
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:04,511
Happening

332
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,279
Yeah it's

333
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,839
Doing the least

334
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,863
That you can

335
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,143
Help people make a

336
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,423
Yep good choices

337
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,215
So

338
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,495
Alex's said this

339
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,519
This the

340
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,287
Narrative

341
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:20,127
At the beginning of it is the 99.999%

342
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,151
Of folks

343
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,943
Rejected the smallpox vaccine

344
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,479
And that's why they needed

345
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:28,319
To do the SARS and they needed to do the monkeypox over to scare people in order to get

346
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:32,415
Presumably which would then kill them or something

347
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,951
I guess yes

348
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,743
The covid vaccine real but just

349
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:38,303
Planet of the past history repeats itself

350
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,655
Yeah and one of the interesting things I've learned this episode

351
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,423
Is that Alex

352
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,447
Made-up let's that

353
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,983
That sounds right

354
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:55,967
.

355
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,343
But if you've got

356
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:04,927
Scott

357
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,287
The police

358
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,359
Well

359
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:35,903
This is not have stats work and I'll Alex the saying is that he made up that number that he cites his me rate of excellent

360
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:40,255
This was only a plan to vaccinate a total of 1000000 people

361
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:44,863
Well half of them were in the military on the other half who were Frontline workers like at the

362
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:49,727
Over 500,000 soldiers did get vaccinated but in terms of civilian

363
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,519
Only 39200

364
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,055
30 + gacha

365
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,895
I was just taking straight numbers that he saw him by

366
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,199
Like who knows what local news Outlet

367
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,991
Presumably about low turnout at

368
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,271
Specific vaccine station

369
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:06,111
Extrapolating those numbers to be representative of the entire story

370
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:09,951
No one with an actual vested interest in reporting stories accurately would engage with the

371
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:10,975
Sick this way cuz it's

372
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:15,071
Just meaning 100,000 members

373
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:17,375
Oh well then everything that I like said

374
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,143
Is

375
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:18,911
Pointless in

376
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,447
Stupid write a dead they're fine

377
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,007
They all got the vaccine they're all fine

378
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:30,431
So why is he saying all this other s*** there was 500,000 people who got the vaccine at 99.99%

379
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,479
It doesn't make any sense cuz half of them got it

380
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,015
No I know but you can

381
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,039
If you just like

382
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:41,439
Read a local news article out of Connecticut and you see if there's low turnout at one place and then you try and do that math

383
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,743
But you know you just use that

384
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,047
Fraction that percentage

385
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,863
If in the next five years everybody dies of Monk

386
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:53,215
Epoch something to be real mad at the military I think the odds of that are love

387
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,287
So yeah it looked

388
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,823
Do you need to understand

389
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,359
About the world

390
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:00,895
And

391
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,687
Please tell me there's so much

392
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:08,063
Well here's the thing everything everything that you hear about

393
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,343
You only hear about

394
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,135
Because the globalist want you to

395
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,183
To hear that all that's scary formation

396
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,463
Yeah yeah yeah

397
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:17,535
If they didn't want you to know about the monkey pox outbreak

398
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:20,095
You never know about

399
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:31,871
Noah Brown

400
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,687
Medical journal

401
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,903
Depressed

402
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:44,671
Call people

403
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,439
Morning

404
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:00,799
Smallpox

405
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,199
I just think that this is a

406
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,479
The dumbwaiter engagement

407
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,247
I got with

408
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,271
Information

409
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:14,111
Yeah everything that they tell you is curated and I must

410
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,135
Must be deceived

411
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,184
I suppose that's easier to

412
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,816
I suppose that's an easier thing to come to an easier conclusion in like 2003

413
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:27,680
It's not the monoculture it's not like you've only got the four channels or whatever

414
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:31,520
But now if somebody said that you would the only information you get is

415
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,288
Is curated

416
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,056
You'd be like

417
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:33,824
Dude

418
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:39,712
I got information coming from everywhere always all the time and it doesn't matter

419
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,136
Doesn't matter

420
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,184
But I think that some of that was true in two

421
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,536
732 I mean the internet was obviously not as

422
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,120
Is it is now but there were there were elements of that

423
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:59,936
And I think of it like if you're just going to say that

424
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:05,312
You know even with just like the news channels the mainstream Legacy News Channel sure

425
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,384
If you want to say that everything that they are covering

426
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,152
Ever

427
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:13,504
Is highly curated because it's what they want you to be aware of or whatever

428
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:17,600
That's just a lazy way of advocating your responsibility to

429
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,648
Like engage with news

430
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,184
Figure out like

431
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,208
What

432
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,792
There are some things that are probably likes

433
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,328
Sponsored content

434
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,864
4 /

435
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,448
You know you can have a responsibility to to dig through and figure out what's what

436
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,776
Yeah and it's also a good way of saying

437
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:42,944
You can only trust me never trust anyone else ever about anything especially if they tell you're not

438
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:49,344
To trust me because again I'm the only person you can trust their lying to you so if they point out all of these things that I lied

439
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:56,768
I didn't actually know anybody who went to have and all of that b*******

440
00:22:57,024 --> 00:23:00,352
You to know and what I want you to know it's not that

441
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:04,704
But different than what the heck why they're going to shut me now

442
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,240
I don't need your money

443
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:10,080
My imaginary friend is broke

444
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,968
Imaginary Friends imaginary car as is a

445
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:17,248
Blew a fuse

446
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:23,648
I would love to pay him back but I owe him twenty bucks so man we're all screwed here in this case adjust a mountain

447
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:27,488
That he's got imaginary loan sharking

448
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,536
That guy

449
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,840
The imaginary Lonestar

450
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:37,216
Do you do not want to f*** with that

451
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:38,240
He's too good

452
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:42,080
Sharks are somebody's friend

453
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:45,664
The imaginary must be somebody's imaginary friend

454
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,200
Shrew

455
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:53,856
A real sad day for the real said day-to-day life of the imaginary LoJack friend but what if I cure it

456
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:57,952
Wild in the mafia or something like that you might have an imaginary love sucks

457
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:02,304
Possible

458
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,840
Because when your Kik you look up to

459
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:07,936
To your father doesn't matter if your father was a brutal lodestar

460
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:11,008
Protection rackets that's not what's important

461
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,824
What's important is that he's your dad

462
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:19,968
I think we have some bad predictions so far monkeypox seems like

463
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:22,528
Bigger deal to Alex than the rest of the world Trail

464
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,856
The somehow he's thinking that's going

465
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,904
Tube used to give everyone

466
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,928
Smallpox

467
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,072
The nuclear war with North Korea thing is

468
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,656
Also apparently the draft

469
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,424
Coming back

470
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:42,240
Also I'm mr. Rumsfeld

471
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,640
North Korea

472
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:53,248
Wind-up do you and your family and you'll be all for it

473
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:56,576
Aunt Tara

474
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,392
1/4

475
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:05,024
That is really condescending for something that is

476
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,144
Love that smug tone

477
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,168
Call boy

478
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:15,008
Shout out to everybody who thinks Alex is right about everything

479
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:20,384
On this episode nobody has been to heaven

480
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,408
I will say that

481
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,176
But

482
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,712
Alex does have Aaron zelman

483
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,992
The guy who runs

484
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:31,392
Jews for the preservation of firearms ownership

485
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,416
R a

486
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,464
Support at this point

487
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,488
NRA

488
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:40,096
Brighton 2003 but he's in favor of this organization and then gunownersofamerica

489
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,936
But before Aaron zelman shows up Alex takes

490
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:44,704
Call

491
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:48,288
Batman is call is so funny in 2021

492
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,336
Warrior on the air go ahead

493
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:51,616
Alex

494
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:52,896
Talking about

495
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:54,944
Cragar robber

496
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,224
Work yesterday and

497
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:56,992
I like that was

498
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:57,760
A very good

499
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,040
Like even though

500
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,320
Some might consider that a

501
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,344
Materialism

502
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,368
No

503
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,416
That you do have to do so

504
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,464
Look like there again

505
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:09,024
Was that

506
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:12,864
Nothing

507
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,168
Against DIA

508
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:18,496
Send your family you still have to try

509
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,288
Because you are going to answer

510
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,312
For what you do

511
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:23,872
I also wanted to

512
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:28,224
I just want to host

513
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:30,784
Pics of aliens

514
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,344
He's robotoid

515
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,624
Come across Ciara

516
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:35,904
It's important to me

517
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,696
Maintain credibility in NatWest

518
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,232
Patriots

519
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,024
Idiots

520
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:47,936
Proven

521
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:55,872
Oh really don't mix it things that can't be proven like your imaginary friend is waiting for you to snitch when you get to heaven

522
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:58,432
Man that clip really f**** me up

523
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:01,248
I don't know maybe I'm dumb

524
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:04,064
Maybe I'm done listening to that clip because they want

525
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,928
I think it's a powerful delusion

526
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:12,000
Being mutually reinforced

527
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:18,144
That clip is funny the day after he talks to someone who went to heaven

528
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:21,472
It's also funny considering where he's

529
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:25,056
Like what type of s*** that Alex covers now

530
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,848
In the past

531
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,664
Would look at his jet like if you modulated The Voice

532
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:32,736
Of Alex's show in the present-day so we couldn't tell it was him

533
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:35,296
You might not even be able to tell his voice his voice

534
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:42,976
A pitch adjuster you play it for him he be like this purse

535
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:45,024
Trying to make the Patriots look terrible

536
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:49,120
Hundred percent would be like this guy is

537
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:52,192
Is f****** killing the movement destroying Alex

538
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,472
Been the president

539
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:54,496
Would be the

540
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,032
Perfect foil for Alex

541
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:03,712
Yeah but I mean I feel like Alex in the present would have a pretty unbeatable argument which is

542
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,480
Is just like

543
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:06,528
Look at how stupid that guy is

544
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,832
What he was saying is

545
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:11,904
Tone it down so you can be credible in the real world

546
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,928
What one

547
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,976
What's going as far and as

548
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:15,744
The hardness

549
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,280
Loud as humanly possible

550
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,816
True

551
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,888
Maybe I feel like maybe that guy's an idiot

552
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:23,936
I mean I know he's in

553
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:24,704
There we go

554
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:31,872
I was looking in the mirror when I said that I think I might be the dump

555
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:32,640
One here

556
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:34,944
Strange hits

557
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,480
Really it's really straight

558
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:40,064
Cuz it seems like he's making a really reasonable point

559
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:45,696
But not like that what you was trying to differentiate himself from like David Icke

560
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:50,048
That's what you would say about him back in the day and now they're best friends

561
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,328
A sort of

562
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,352
Timing thing

563
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:53,376
Nina

564
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,144
Duet

565
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,680
Go crazy at the right time

566
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:58,496
Don't be David I can go crazy too soon

567
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:02,336
When the going gets weird the weird turn pro

568
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,360
What you got to do

569
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:06,176
You got a running president

570
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:08,480
The going is getting weird

571
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:11,552
Money wins it's all over

572
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:15,648
So Aaron zelman comes in and I don't know

573
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,928
Inasmuch as

574
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,208
Somebody just like wants

575
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:20,512
People to be allowed to own guns

576
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:21,792
Vine

577
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:24,864
Sure but he troubles me in other ways

578
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,312
Picking up a spider

579
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:34,848
And

580
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,152
The master

581
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,432
Long range rifle

582
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:41,760
I would have to peel an onion anymore

583
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:51,488
Coronavirus

584
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,560
You'll learn how to master

585
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,328
Range rifles

586
00:29:58,912 --> 00:29:59,936
Cancer spread

587
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:02,240
OK Google

588
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,032
Disappear

589
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,312
Holyshit

590
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,592
Cut that level

591
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:12,992
Sierra zellman's coming in and he's like big I'd learn to f****** use a sniper rifle

592
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,016
Self

593
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:18,112
And it's going to your going to have to be on a rooftop shooting everybody

594
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:21,952
Why are you even saying sniper rifle you don't need a scope

595
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,768
Holy

596
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,048
Yeah that's upsetting

597
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:32,448
That's a great little bit of a little bit of a

598
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:33,728
I hope I don't have to

599
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,264
The people that own anymore

600
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:42,688
If I say what I think I think I'm going to commit a crime that's all I really want is to imply heavily

601
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:44,480
Leave it everyone else should committed

602
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:46,272
Crime

603
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:49,856
It's about implying come on

604
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,672
You got to get

605
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,232
Capable with a sniper rifle

606
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:56,768
And part of the reason is because

607
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,048
Everybody

608
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,840
The cops everybody's out of control

609
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:05,984
What is state is Alton f****** society look like if everybody's good with a sniper

610
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:13,920
How do you go how do you go to f****** stores somebody's got him beat on you yeah

611
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:18,784
I know be really dangerous to use instacart

612
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,576
You sure it's not going to show up

613
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,136
Yeah

614
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:31,840
Elaborate body armor suits might become more popular

615
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:38,240
Anime instantaneously

616
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,032
I love it

617
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:42,592
Bruce Lee underground tunnel

618
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:46,432
I do like a good underground tunnel we might become the morlocks

619
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:51,808
It's Alex I mean

620
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:55,136
You got to do something

621
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,952
That's a good rewriting of

622
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:58,720
The Time Machine

623
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:02,304
There's a reason for getting into sniping

624
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,840
And it's because like I said

625
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:04,864
The state

626
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:07,424
The government as evidence

627
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,752
Let's buy this third-hand story that has K wants to tell

628
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,104
New York

629
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,696
But the distance

630
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:32,512
Situation

631
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:33,792
Is this the best

632
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:35,584
Example you have I mean

633
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,632
Listen I think it's b*******

634
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:41,216
Criminalizing just hanging around is a good way to destroy the poor

635
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:47,616
What you do I don't disagree with the long rifle probably not

636
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:50,944
Probably not I also don't know if this story happened

637
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,272
As it being told the lawyer in charge may have been

638
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:55,808
Related to something else

639
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:02,720
Be completely made up by this person that Aaron zelman was talking to

640
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:07,328
There's a hundred like Wyatt why are you even bringing this up why does this rank

641
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:09,376
There we go

642
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,680
Nazi again

643
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,728
I think it's wrong

644
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:16,544
And I'm sure if regardless of whether or not this story is

645
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:22,944
Exactly true let's go with that mean if you were not a racist you might just go with the stop-and-frisk policy

646
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:29,344
Even bothering with a third-hand story from some a****** who doesn't know any details who may have been loitering and you have to

647
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,184
Admit I just bought I don't know what happened

648
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:39,584
Datavac hang up stop Aaron's almond expect something like that to be

649
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,376
Like is it really

650
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:43,168
I am not convinced

651
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:43,936
That

652
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:46,752
The government is out of control based on this story

653
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:47,776
Now imagine that

654
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:51,872
That's right so you are hanging out on a hydrant

655
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,920
And a cop comes up to your knees like a

656
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:58,016
Can't loiter here and you're like no I can absolutely order here and he gives you a ticket

657
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:58,784
Right

658
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:03,648
You're long-rifles not going to do much in that situation you don't have the speed

659
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,184
To close down

660
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,512
What's the point of a long rifle if this is your example of how we have to

661
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,280
Fight back against

662
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,304
True

663
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:16,192
1 timeout stop nose for this one time I was skateboarding.

664
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:20,032
And I jumped up onto a hydrant and I spun around like a

665
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,824
If this a weed

666
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:23,872
Cop punched

667
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,920
I fell over

668
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,712
The police are out of control

669
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:32,064
Control this was in a video

670
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:35,904
How to tell Aaron Belmont about it he's going to tell Alex

671
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:36,672
Bellboy

672
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:40,512
So yeah Alex is this thought about the drug war

673
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,352
Audio

674
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:48,448
The more I learn about Alex's positions

675
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,728
About things that I

676
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:52,544
In fiery thought I agreed with him about

677
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,872
The more convinced I am that I'm not I don't really actually agree with him

678
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:59,456
All that much like legalization of drugs

679
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,224
I think is one of the

680
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:08,160
And you had

681
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,072
Look for low-level drug

682
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:18,656
Live now

683
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,008
I don't feel like I agree with him

684
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:26,592
And I don't feel like this is the way I understood his position

685
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,360
Yeah

686
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:30,944
I would say the reason that I felt

687
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,272
To place I've come to with never agreeing with Alex about any

688
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:36,064
About anything ever

689
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,648
Is because no matter what it is his position is

690
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,464
What I know now is that all of his positions

691
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,744
Have conditions

692
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,768
That can change on

693
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:46,816
On his whim and only his wings

694
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:51,424
It's true that whatever it is he thinks his position is or is presenting his position at

695
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,728
Given the opportunity to do something about it

696
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:56,800
He would change the conditions to whatever it is he wanted them to

697
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,384
Yeah yeah I think I don't think you're right on that count

698
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:01,920
Oh I think that

699
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:04,480
Decriminalization is something that's really important

700
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:05,248
Because

701
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,784
Many drug

702
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,088
Issue should be dealt with as medical issue

703
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:12,160
This is something that's not necessarily

704
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,696
Putative

705
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:14,976
Approach is

706
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,256
I don't know if it has

707
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,024
The best

708
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:19,328
Cheats for for helping p

709
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,352
Right

710
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:23,680
I suppose what it has the best chance of doing is

711
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,264
Creating more slave

712
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,312
ABS California to use

713
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:31,360
To fight their fires

714
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:34,176
I don't know it's a primary motivation for wanting

715
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,712
Drug legalization

716
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:36,480
Listen to happen

717
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,808
Is because the globalist make money on drugs

718
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:45,696
That to me is empty

719
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:49,536
That's what happens when you reduce everything down to Capital isn't it

720
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,328
I guess the wrong people I mean

721
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,864
Choose as a consumer

722
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:56,192
Do not let all of these millions of people get

723
00:36:56,704 --> 00:37:02,336
F***** over forever but that's only because the wrong people make money off of it if I was making money off of

724
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:03,104
The drug war

725
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,896
Yeah of course we're having the driveway

726
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:07,968
So on this collar

727
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:08,736
Because in

728
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,016
And he wants

729
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:11,296
To know why

730
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,320
Aaron zelman

731
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:14,624
Is telling people that they need to

732
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,160
Sniper rifles

733
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:20,000
This made me really

734
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:24,096
Recommend

735
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:26,912
Do you do know about the weapon

736
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:32,032
Do you want to be

737
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:36,384
Far away from the enemies you can

738
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,688
Can you tell me why

739
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:43,296
Call Tom

740
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,160
Sheree we're not going to say go kill people sir

741
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,440
You know that's what we me

742
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:55,328
You you know that the answer is you can't get close to high-profile people

743
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:56,864
That we would want you to talk

744
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:58,400
Be quote-unquote 12

745
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:04,288
That's f***** up I mean what he might as well have said is

746
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:09,152
You think Kennedy's getting his head blown off with a short rifle in oh

747
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:15,552
Alex later then goes on to be like in obviously

748
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:21,952
Chinese troops Landing or landed Vision sniper rifle would not be helpful

749
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:24,000
Against a land invasion

750
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,536
I mean

751
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,328
Alright

752
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:33,728
China storm agar beaches what are we going to do alright we're going to line the border with 10 million

753
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,264
People with sniper rifles

754
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:38,080
Fire whenever you feel like it

755
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:42,688
Strategies metalman the Revolutionary War

756
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,992
So I feel like

757
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:49,344
In the same way become a little bit disillusioned with Alex's

758
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,368
Dunno is is

759
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:53,184
What would seem to be an agreement

760
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:53,952
In terms of

761
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:54,720
Drug

762
00:38:54,976 --> 00:39:01,120
Policy I feel like I've also become disabused of the notion that he and I actually agreed about bush

763
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:01,888
Either

764
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:05,984
I think that he was using George Bush as a bit of a political tool

765
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,080
Down exposing a corrupt

766
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,640
Liberals

767
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:14,176
Convert

768
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,240
Look at you

769
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:43,872
Okay YouTube

770
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,176
Sia buddy

771
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:49,248
So it's only the Liberals need the program

772
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:52,064
And you were able to achieve this

773
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:52,832
Bye

774
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:56,928
Hearing sane by criticizing bush

775
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:01,792
So what you're doing is essentially trying to gain credibility for your

776
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:03,840
Extreme right-wing positions

777
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:07,424
By throwing the middle right under the bus

778
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,704
That's what you're doing

779
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,752
You're trying to appeal

780
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,288
It seemed reasonable

781
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:15,104
I mean that's what he's doing now with the the big box

782
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,128
Churches kind of

783
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:16,896
You know

784
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:17,664
ACH

785
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,200
Throwing the

786
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:23,552
Mainstream Christianity litterbug

787
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:25,856
Throw them under the hood

788
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,648
That kind of b*******

789
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:34,048
Christianity and all this nonsense we're waking up all these liberal Christians

790
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,840
Killing everybody we don't like

791
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:36,864
That's great

792
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:38,144
Yeah it's

793
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,936
It just seems like an intentional strategy

794
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:42,240
Yeah it is absolutely an intentional

795
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:45,824
I think I think part of that might be because I

796
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:50,432
Maybe he doesn't have much hope of actually converting all that many bush

797
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:52,224
Or like.

798
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,272
Conservative-leaning people maybe

799
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:56,320
Maybe maybe he's aware of that

800
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:59,392
They like that that's not that's not a fruitful Pawn for him

801
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,160
Deficient

802
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,184
Yeah I mean that

803
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:01,952
I guess

804
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:04,512
I guess it in that was born out because they came to him

805
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:07,328
You know he didn't he never convinced

806
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:10,912
Neocon still love him all the sudden they just started going f******

807
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,448
I'm crazy and then

808
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,216
He was there

809
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:16,032
Yeah he was ready and waiting for those

810
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:18,848
Dumb dumb dumb people to show up

811
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:23,200
Dora tea party event Trump eroded everything to the point where

812
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:24,736
Is normal

813
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:26,272
Is like a f******

814
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,040
Bilbo

815
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:29,088
Hobbit situation with Bjorn

816
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,160
Dwarf showing up one at a goddamn time

817
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,184
Can't Stop

818
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:37,536
Sorry that's a weird Hobbit reference for no reason

819
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:38,304
They got there

820
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,120
So Alex could take another call from a guy

821
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:44,960
And this service fellow would like Alex to speak at the University of Austin

822
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:47,264
Do UT Texas

823
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,312
Is Austin better be an interesting day

824
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:54,943
Yeah I'm going to tell you that the booking doesn't seem likely for me it doesn't seem like he's going to get that book

825
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:57,503
But there are some conditions upon which you would accept

826
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:00,319
Stopwatch

827
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,343
On table

828
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:02,623
Donald Trump

829
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:12,351
Krowd

830
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:15,935
I'll come do it

831
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:19,007
Well I can do a bullhorn

832
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:23,871
Invicta Viper smoking at UT twice before

833
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:29,247
Visited my dad's office I said hi to somebody

834
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:31,039
I've spoken of UT

835
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:37,439
I would say go f*** yourself with it if you can get me a big enough crowd also

836
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:44,607
You went to Kansas City to feel like a opening of a tire store local radio

837
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:48,191
Fly across the country to open a grocery

838
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:49,471
Restore

839
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:51,775
How do you open a grocery store

840
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:54,335
Like mask

841
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,991
UT got him two people

842
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,319
If you take out of a

843
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:06,111
Sandwich

844
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,903
So there's more calls

845
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,439
Most of the rest of the show is called

846
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:11,999
Actually not a whole lot of

847
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:13,023
Meat left on the phone

848
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:14,815
But

849
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:17,631
I don't know if I like that lesser more than that

850
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:20,447
Cuz it seems like he doesn't take too many calls

851
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:21,727
Yet

852
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,007
It's not as

853
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:26,079
Facts about taking calls now

854
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,615
A b a b

855
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:28,639
Elephant doesn't happen

856
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:30,431
I meant also

857
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:32,223
He has like just the same

858
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:33,247
People calling

859
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:36,831
Yeah in the present like this guy Carlos calls in all the time

860
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,111
Pretty much every time though

861
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:40,671
Phone lines are open that doodle get in there

862
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:42,719
Yeah it makes me wonder if like

863
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:45,535
There are just a few people who call

864
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:48,863
I don't know I really have no idea

865
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:50,143
I think

866
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:50,911
Vets

867
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:52,959
In terms of my listening

868
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:53,983
Enjoyment

869
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:56,031
I prefer it like this in 2000

870
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:59,615
Sees it feels like a radio show

871
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:06,271
I was thinking that about this from like a purely enjoyable standpoint I prefer being in the past and these colors are are

872
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:08,575
No I'm suck and are boring

873
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:09,599
But

874
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:12,159
It's still like at least

875
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:17,023
There is victus input of the listeners and Alex has to

876
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:21,631
Yes and with them a ramshackle charm to it

877
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:27,519
And I don't know if I would like that now though because I don't know if I would be able to handle what the

878
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:28,799
Callers would say now

879
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,847
Yeah you know like back then

880
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:36,479
The closest we got was that guy being like hey what do you think I should use this wrong long rifle for

881
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:37,503
That was

882
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:40,319
Right now if somebody called in I feel like they be like

883
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:43,391
No no I didn't ask you what should I use it for I said

884
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:46,463
Who who do you want me to kill with his rifle

885
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:51,071
I don't want to live there yeah I think I think you're right I think

886
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:54,143
If I were Alex I would be aware that

887
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,679
It might not be a good idea to

888
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:57,727
To trust a lot of the audience with a

889
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,263
Can open phone

890
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:01,311
That could be that could be rough

891
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:07,967
But then again I probably wouldn't trust most of the people he has on his guests to speak

892
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:10,783
What's this color

893
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:12,575
Hellboy

894
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:14,879
I mean obviously this is a sovereign

895
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:16,415
Sure

896
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:18,975
There were a lot more of them in Alex's audience

897
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:19,999
At this point

898
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:21,279
I would say

899
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:23,583
You know I mean I'm not like Alex I don't

900
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:24,351
Does makeup stupid

901
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:28,703
Explode say 99.9999 percent of his callers or suffer

902
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:30,751
Okay that sounds about right

903
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:32,543
It's about four out of 20,000

904
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:33,567
TimberTech

905
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:35,871
This person believes

906
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:37,151
This lady she believes

907
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:38,175
Yes

908
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:39,199
Is that

909
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:41,759
According to God and the Constitution

910
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:44,063
She does not need a driver's

911
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:46,111
Because all right

912
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:47,647
Her husband owns the car

913
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:49,183
And he gave her permission to use a

914
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:50,975
Which makes sense

915
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:57,631
Alex how are you today

916
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:01,215
I'm pretty good people how are you

917
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:02,495
Being followed

918
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:06,335
Monday I took a trip to town

919
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:08,127
Aaron's hours

920
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:09,151
Pulled over by

921
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:11,967
State trooper he was doing his dad

922
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:12,991
I don't know what

923
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:15,039
He never gave me an explanation

924
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:17,087
He was just pulling people over

925
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:19,135
They were standing in the middle of the highway

926
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:20,927
And after

927
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:22,207
Going to say their driver's license

928
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:26,559
So he had to a gentleman on one on the other Saturday

929
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,351
Black and his wife

930
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,119
Anthony told me

931
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:29,887
Waited

932
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:30,655
Give him

933
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:34,751
And I said no sir I do not have one

934
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:39,103
First mistake

935
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:40,383
It came back

936
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:41,407
Umi

937
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:43,967
My son and I

938
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:47,295
He said you want to tell me why you don't have a glass

939
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:49,599
Everything I said yesterday I believe in the car

940
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:51,135
United States

941
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:53,951
Believe in the Bible

942
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:56,255
My husband is this track

943
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:58,559
Give me permission to drive it

944
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:01,887
So therefore unless he tells me to get a driver's license

945
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:03,679
You show me where the

946
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:04,703
Selena

947
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:07,007
The state says that I have to have a driver's license

948
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:08,287
Or a license

949
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:09,311
At all

950
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,335
How to operate

951
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,871
Thing that my husband owns

952
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:14,687
And gives me permission to you

953
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:16,223
Then I'll go get one

954
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:21,343
Cetme

955
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:24,159
And the funny thing about this story

956
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:29,791
Teas that it ends up with the cop letting her go with a warning

957
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:35,679
Goddamnit she's actually I think she's totally right but in the wrong way like she says that

958
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,983
She probably wouldn't have been

959
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:41,311
Been treated this way if she didn't have her kid with her in the car

960
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:43,359
He's saying that you would have gotten roughed up

961
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:48,735
And like Tina beating up for being a Patriots fan mad about this kind of thing

962
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:53,855
But I think she probably was treated differently because she had a young child in the car and the guy probably

963
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:55,903
Just get a really

964
00:47:56,159 --> 00:48:00,511
F****** their day I'm just going to let this go

965
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:04,095
This is going to be

966
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,375
Too much insanity

967
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,655
To try and beat through

968
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:09,215
What's that what's what's going on here what

969
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:11,007
Know if she calls in

970
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:17,407
To Alex's show to tell this nonsensical story about how is your husband owns the truck and he gives you permission

971
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:20,479
Then the constituted could drive

972
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:25,087
Ed Dudley the cop was nice and let her go and then they demonized him but I wanted to beat her up

973
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:27,135
Crazy

974
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:29,695
To think about

975
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:30,975
I imagine being a

976
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:33,535
Like whenever you ask people

977
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:34,559
Tell me why your

978
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:35,583
Do this

979
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:38,143
You don't want to hear him say like no I'm not going to tell you

980
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,679
Like that's going to be a lot of work

981
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:40,959
But if you hear him safe

982
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:43,007
Yes I would love to tell you why you're like

983
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,543
This is some Sovereign Center

984
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:47,615
It's about to happen the only people who have your like

985
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:49,663
Do you want to tell me why you don't have a

986
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:54,783
Sansar like yes I do and the Constitution like no go just go

987
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:57,343
Go go get into an accident

988
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,903
A pull-down on like the

989
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:02,975
The Duru for that car it's a screen

990
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:09,375
Projector setup I have a present

991
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,655
Temptation ready to go

992
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:14,751
Excuse me ma'am you need to understand this question was more rhetorical

993
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:16,543
And I have no

994
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:19,359
Justin the answer the problem is you don't have a life

995
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:21,919
Pushes in at 8

996
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:24,479
This presentation is a soundtrack

997
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:30,111
Put a lot of work into this officer you will listen to it

998
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,135
Excuse me officer

999
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:36,767
Would you be happy to know that I have been waiting just for this exact situation with a lot of

1000
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:38,303
Props

1001
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:44,191
7 hour and I am going to open the door just to do a little soft-shoe

1002
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:47,007
There's a cop number in the middle of the presentation

1003
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:48,287
Real Tavern intermission

1004
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:49,567
So please don't shoot

1005
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:52,639
You can't have a 3-hour show without an intermission that's just rude

1006
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:55,967
I find it really fascinating

1007
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:59,295
How many times there are people who call in

1008
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,831
With horror stories

1009
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:02,879
To Alex's show about things

1010
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:05,695
Things that are just like they're just being annoying

1011
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:08,255
Another story is

1012
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:09,279
Nothing happened

1013
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:17,471
I was bothering somebody and then I didn't receive any consequences for it Alex can you believe this world

1014
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:22,847
I was being super annoying to a cop who just decided to let me go with a warning man

1015
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:23,615
I am us

1016
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:26,175
Call Alex about the

1017
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:27,199
Because of that

1018
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:28,735
I feel like so much of Alex

1019
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:29,503
Scholars

1020
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:30,527
With these types

1021
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:33,343
YouTube stories like the unspoken parentheses is

1022
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:35,135
And I'm white

1023
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:38,463
You know like this type of treatment happens to non-white

1024
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:40,255
I can't believe it happened to me

1025
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:46,143
I think a lot of the time they're probably a little bit of that energy but in this case I think it's more just

1026
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:48,447
Rosario sabado

1027
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:49,215
Different world

1028
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:54,335
Alex wants to know whether or not there was

1029
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:57,407
Chicanery going on with the 2000 election

1030
00:50:57,919 --> 00:51:02,015
Guess there was a document

1031
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,039
Romance

1032
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:05,855
Fraudulent

1033
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:10,207
Fragile activity what with the with the

1034
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:11,231
What's going on

1035
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:16,863
I only do

1036
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:19,679
Buck off

1037
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:23,007
Very rarely

1038
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:34,271
Oklahoma City

1039
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:39,391
Took over

1040
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,191
Was the president

1041
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:54,751
Okay

1042
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:58,847
What's the present

1043
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:05,247
Democrat

1044
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:06,527
Voting machines

1045
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:07,295
Car

1046
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:12,415
He has an example of Republicans treating to just to be like

1047
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,463
Aboveboard and make sure that

1048
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:16,255
I cut it off

1049
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:21,119
Ver Broncos like the rest of the clip Rambles on a bit but it does give an example of like

1050
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:23,679
Okay are the Republicans

1051
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:24,447
Yes of course

1052
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:28,799
I didn't know that voter news service

1053
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:30,079
Is

1054
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:31,871
Behind everything

1055
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:37,759
The military-industrial complex change their name to voter new service

1056
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:40,575
I don't know that was a

1057
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:43,903
That was a real grocery list of being wrong about stuff how

1058
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:49,535
How is it possible that I've listened to thousands of hours of Alex's show

1059
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:55,167
I've never heard him weaving Yarns about voter new service they change their name

1060
00:52:55,679 --> 00:53:01,823
They had so many names you don't even know what their name is now I don't even know if it was that they don't exist okay well there's that

1061
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:02,591
They didn't exist

1062
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,639
At the time of Alex's recording

1063
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:05,663
Husqvarna

1064
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:12,063
This is Addison exit polling group that was formed to various news entities didn't have to do duplicate work exit polling

1065
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:13,599
Doing the same question

1066
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:16,415
All have one uniform

1067
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:17,183
Source

1068
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:23,583
The organization did such a bad job with a 2000 election however that they were disbanded in January 2003

1069
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:28,191
Well before the episode Alex is doing right now that we're going over

1070
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:32,287
Okay I have no idea how voter new service could have took it over after

1071
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:35,615
Kennedy was killed seeing as they were formed in 1990

1072
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:38,943
Also I think that if Alex knows the people were stopping ballots

1073
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:45,343
Did the voting machines that they had stored in their cars then the answer to the question of whether or not he knows of any fraud going on and that election is

1074
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:46,367
Yes

1075
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:53,791
The answer is not a long-winded non-answer about I only know things that I know

1076
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:55,583
Do a yes or no question they are looking

1077
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:56,607
For an answer that is

1078
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:57,375
Is yes

1079
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,143
Or no

1080
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:59,935
And when the answer is yes

1081
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,727
Because there were people

1082
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,263
7 ballots are devoting

1083
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:04,031
Machines that they hadn't

1084
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:05,823
The cars you just say yes yeah

1085
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:06,847
You were stuffing

1086
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:07,871
Balance

1087
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:10,175
Into voting machines

1088
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:11,711
In their car

1089
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:14,527
Yeah they're sitting the cargo my God has so many pellets

1090
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:19,903
I'm supposed to believe that fraud

1091
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:24,767
Get my call right now I am freaking out I'm still so many ballads

1092
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:31,935
These people are so bad at feeling election all the sudden they're in their cars

1093
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:33,215
And their fuc

1094
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:35,775
Wait wait

1095
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:38,335
What if this is fast 10

1096
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:42,175
This is what we do they're stealing election ultimate fever

1097
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:49,855
What's a ildas feel all that f****** money just to train to steal an election

1098
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:50,623
And they're going

1099
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:58,047

Machines in cars

Presenting I don't know what

1115
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:45,919
He's trying to insinuate

1116
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:47,199
Is he insinuating that they

1117
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:51,039
Killed Kennedy or that they just filled the power vacuum after Kennedy

1118
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:52,319
No idea

1119
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:59,487
I'd love to learn more will come up in other 2003 episodes cuz

1122
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:03,583
Confusing

1123
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:04,863
So

1124
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:07,679
You know the people revolutionaries

1125
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:09,983
The catchphrases

1126
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:10,751
They've used

1127
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:13,055
Chirp

1128
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:14,847
Each one teach one

1129
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:16,383
Read something that said

1130
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:17,407
Gets used to know

1131
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:22,015
In order to grow a movement needs a friend

1132
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:25,087
Then you tell somebody

1133
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:27,647
The Alex is talking to somebody

1134
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:28,415
Showed his

1135
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:30,207
What about Alex's documentaries

1136
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:30,975
At their Church

1137
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:32,255
Function

1138
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:35,583
Gray metallic slime view longest winded way possible

1139
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:36,863
To say Each one teach one

1140
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:51,967
Bring 100 we going to do this

1141
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:59,647
Alright

448

1143
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:10,399
Yeah I don't know if he realized like this was getting a little long or if he couldn't do that do that Matthew

1144
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:12,703
You seem to be doing okay up till that point

1145
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:18,847
Yeah it didn't even seem like it was taking him that long to come to the the x 2 and there

1146
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:20,127
I mean

1147
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:21,407
I just think there's an

1148
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:22,943
Talking easier way to express

1149
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:30,367
Concept that's been around since the beginning of humans

1150
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:32,671
Trying to let you know

1151
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:36,767
Congregate yeah I would assume that we would have figured out a shorter way to say it by now

1152
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,583
This Mexico

1153
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:40,607
I just think it's really funny

1154
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:43,423
Because I want to talk to this guy who played this video

1155
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:45,215
Documentaries for his church

1156
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:45,983
And Alex

1157
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:47,519
Needs to know like

1158
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,311
How did it go how'd it go today

1159
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:50,591
Standing ovation

1160
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:56,991
Yeah I mean

1161
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:02,879
Gas

1162
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:09,023
1 and over

1163
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:12,351
Not even like good people like it he went straight to

1164
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:16,191
How crazy did people find it at people gas

1165
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:20,031
How many how many Church ladies fainted

1166
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:23,615
How many people brought out to another fans

1167
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:30,527
How did they like the new movie did anybody get down on their knees

1168
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:31,551
Play some good to worship me

1169
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:33,087
Is that

1170
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:39,487
No no zero people not even one that's you and that's unusual I'm going to call voter new service

1171
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:42,303
Exit poll data address

1172
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:47,423
I need one last clip here and it's one of the other big headlines that Alex

1173
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:48,191
Has been hitting

1174
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:49,983
And that is that

1175
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:55,615
There's been a little bit of a stock market downturn and the United States has lost

1176
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:58,431
North America as a whole has lost some millionaires

1177
00:58:58,687 --> 00:59:01,759
Oh no I would like you

1178
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:02,527
2

1179
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:03,551
Think about

1180
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:05,087
The way in which Alex

1181
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:06,111
Describes

1182
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:07,647
Relative wealth

1183
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:08,415
Okay

1184
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:16,607
Millionaire

1185
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:19,167
Are you getting ready

1186
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:25,311
What

1187
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:27,359
The

1188
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:45,791
That's pretty interesting but that's

1189
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:46,815
What is conception

1190
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:49,375
Also also it's not the crumbs

1191
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:50,399
The Klumps

1192
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:51,167
Yeah

1193
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:54,495
Sorry

1194
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:56,799
Yeah

1195
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:58,335
That's like whenever there is

1196
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:00,127
Ask a politician they like how much does a

1197
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:06,527
Is a gallon of milk cost at $23 isn't real to me anymore

1198
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:09,855
It's really strange that Alex in 2000

1199
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:11,135
3:00 would have this

1200
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:11,903
Kind of

1201
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:13,695
Up respect

1202
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:19,839
Ociaa dentist dad his family comes from oil money I wouldn't be surprised if he's not

1203
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:23,679
Unfamiliar with the Finer Things and very on

1204
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:26,495
Familiar with I do believe that Alex

1205
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:28,031
Is

1206
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:30,591
It was a boy of memes that say

1207
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:35,711
But I I still think so much of his primary brand is supposed to be like

1208
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:36,735
I'm like you

1209
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:38,015
Yeah you know that

1210
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:39,039
Sing

1211
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:39,807
Sings it

1212
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:41,855
Having a couple million

1213
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:44,415
Is being lower-middle-class is

1214
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:46,463
Inaccurate

1215
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:49,535
Do you know how many people have a couple of million

1216
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:52,607
That would be the top 1%

1217
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:55,679
But there are a lot of millionaires

1218
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:58,495
That is true I mean yeah but

1219
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:01,311
The even if I'd remember the numbers correctly like

1220
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:02,335
It is

1221
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:06,687
90% of the country does not have anywhere near a million.

1222
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:08,223
So

1223
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:09,247
Yeah

1224
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:10,527
Yeah the middle class

1225
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:11,551
What you would say

1226
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:14,111
Suggested somewhere in the median in o

1227
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:19,487
There that they're nowhere near a million. Middle middle class is going to be

1228
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:21,023
Do you know something in the alike

1229
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:23,071
$100,000 a year

1230
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:27,167
Salary I know it's going to be in that conversation

1231
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:29,983
Not a couple billion dollars

1232
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:31,263
Batman

1233
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:33,311
Well

1234
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:35,871
A couple million dollars

1235
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:36,639
Christ

1236
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:40,223
What it what Daisy just did I just I have no idea

1237
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:43,039
They just don't know if you're rich you just

1238
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:45,343
You have no idea if you're listening to Alex

1239
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:48,159
2003 and you hear that and you're like

1240
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:49,439
I make

1241
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:50,719
30 grand

1242
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:51,487
The year

1243
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:52,511
You've got to be like

1244
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:53,535
What am I

1245
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:55,583
I'm so poor

1246
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:00,191
Lower middle classes somebody with millions of dollars

1247
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:00,959
She's a

1248
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:02,495
Jesus Christ

1249
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:03,263
It's just it's

1250
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:04,031
It's very strange

1251
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:06,335
I think it speaks to his brain

1252
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:07,103
He's weird

1253
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:08,383
He doesn't know how people live

1254
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:11,199
Nope nope rich people don't

1255
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:14,271
Also about as much connect

1256
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:15,295
Come to reality as

1257
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:21,695
Before when you talk to somebody who have been to heaven

1258
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:22,719
Michelle Cohen

1259
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:29,119
You know we come to the end of this year and we've had a little bit of a ride

1260
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:30,911
2003

1261
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:32,959
Well we have Alex on timeout

1262
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:38,079
Will be back to check in on him in the present-day are on Monday but

1263
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:39,359
I need it I need a little

1264
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:40,383
That's

1265
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:41,663
Stay in the past

1266
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:42,431
Got to break

1267
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:43,199
For my own

1268
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:44,479
My own well-being

1269
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:49,599
Alex and his friends have been trying

1270
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:50,879
Time to enlist

1271
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:51,903
Sniper Coors

1272
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:58,303
For long time long time people just been thinking that it's a good idea to get sniper

1273
01:02:58,559 --> 01:02:59,071
The Rifleman

1274
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:00,095
For what's coming

1275
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:01,887
Also I think it would be fun

1276
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:04,447
If we ever watch another one of Alex's films

1277
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:07,519
We just gas but everything

1278
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:09,055
How many gases are there

1279
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:09,823
We're going to count

1280
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:16,223
We're going to f****** keep count there's going to be a projector screen

1281
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:16,991
Try

1282
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:19,039
I don't have a car but you do

1283
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:20,063
I like

1284
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:22,111
To get your permission to drive it

1285
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:23,391
Without a license

1286
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:25,439
I meant try and get myself pulled over

1287
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:28,255
And I know she hears the problem there

1288
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:32,607
One I don't believe in the Bible so that justification is out s***

1289
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:35,935
I'm too I think the Constitution is b*******

1290
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:38,751
I don't have a driver's license I can't have insurance

1291
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:41,055
Another is that

1292
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:45,663
Anyway we're not going to do this

1293
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:49,759
Permission that says not equal license

1294
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:58,207
We are fighting that go to bed

1295
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:04,607
Please find a local charity or Bellefontaine area to help out people doing

1296
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:06,143
Indeed

1297
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:06,911
Until then

1298
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:09,727
