00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:13,824
Sit around and drink red wine

00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,848
Discuss

4
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:17,408
Proposal threadworm

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,944
Think I was looking for pitfalls

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,272
Unless Alex Jones is

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,184
Is 100% honest about everything

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,792
Even when he trips

9
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:34,816
Yes

10
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:38,400
We talked about The Life and Times about

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,472
Hey let me let me ask you

12
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:42,752

17
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:05,536
Who would want that Billerica

18
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:11,168
Speaking of the people who like to give a shout out to your friend Mike what's up Michael

00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,264
Spectacular

30
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,544
Dumbass Alex

31
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:54,688
Adjust nightmare storm

32
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:58,784
I would say that Friday has been one of the worst days

33
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,552
If you probably ever

34
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,160
Thursday into Friday

35
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,720
There aren't

36
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,536
Bring up on Thursday night

37
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,584
The jury and his custody case

38
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,352
Came back

39
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,400
And weather

40
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,424
They were against two

41
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,704
They were not big fans

42
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:19,008
No it's

43
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,336
Sole custody of his children before

44
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,872
And the jury came back with

45
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,152
The decision to

46
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,432
Give the wife

47
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,200
Joint cuts

48
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:29,504
What she also has

49
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,552
Where the kid

50
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:34,624
Yep and they are not they're going to be living with her

51
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,184
And Alex only has visitation

52
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:40,256
And she gets to decide all that

53
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:41,536
So

54
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,840
There's more to be worked out apparently in the courts

55
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:44,864
Like the judge has

56
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,656
Do ghetto get the

57
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,728
Time and stuff like that.

58
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,008
But it reads

59
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:51,776
It's an owl

60
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,312
If it's enalapril Alex

61
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:58,432
It's not good first of many quart Elvis

62
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:04,832
Text going to be experienced Chobani lawsuit

63
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:09,440
So we're going to get into our episode 10 explained what we're going to be talking about today but

64
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:12,000
Before we go for our

65
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:14,816
Out of context of Alex Jones

66
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:18,144
It's fun

67
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,680
We agree

68
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:29,152
We're honest

69
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:34,784
The Rock has become sentient has worth

70
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,064
Boy

71
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,368
I keep I keep saying we're about to get into this

72
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,672
We have been about to get into a lot of

73
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:43,232
I'm a little hungover I got to be

74
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,536
So I have no idea

75
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,840
And this is a new thing that we're going to

76
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:48,608
The startup

77
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:56,544
You're on board

78
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,968
I'm not on board for that

79
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,808
It would be fitting

80
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,368
Ultra Simon Alex Jones's life for us

81
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,160
So just break up crazily

82
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,440
So

83
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:17,536
If you don't agree on at any level you become a policy

84
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:22,655
That stroke you get to you know Alex nights you over over over our Airwaves

85
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:25,215
And you were officially in the weeds

86
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,263
Details

87
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:32,127
Now if you donate $10 or more a month

88
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,431
I am going to make this offer

89
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,295
A bunch of old episodes of Alex Jones

90
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,319
Okay

00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,599
And you could choose

92
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,367
Any date

93
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,207
And as long as I can find the episode

94
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:50,047
We will do an episode about someday in the past

95
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,583
Of your choice

96
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:59,007
The day that Trump announced his candidacy

97
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,431
You can just send an email

98
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,991
Just to tease this even more

99
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,039
I would like to take us back

100
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,575
The February 1st

101
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,111
Of 2016

102
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,903

107
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,399
17%

108
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,727
Everybody was like

109
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:33,823
This is a blip on the radar it's was not the

110
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:42,527
That's what the rest of the world

111
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,551
What was Alex

112
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,679
They had tanks

113
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:06,079
People with gills

114
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,383
Humanoids

115
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:26,303
Aeon Farms or embryos

116
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,327
I keep them alive

117
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,167
The doping

118
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:39,871
Open their eyes

119
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,175
Skills in there

120
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:44,223
Place where humans

121
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:50,879
Yep so that's what he was up to everyone else was talking about the Trump

122
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:57,023
Trump is not a scary the joking Alex Jones is like a pimple

123
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,583
Is basically living in the shadow over in

124
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:02,399
Is living in an HP Lovecraft novel

125
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,423
1 fish

126
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,447
Two fish

127
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,471
Redfish

128
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,055
Picture taking over human eye

129
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,431
Cookbook

130
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,455
Rich people

131
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,831
With horror

132
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,647
Human horror

133
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,439
The kind of fear that only humans

134
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,463
Skin experience

135
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,511
These fish people

136
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:32,607
Anyway

137
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,447
And I was really down

138
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,263
I started research

139
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,055
Can I have a pet

140
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:44,127
Okay now the answer to that is

141
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:46,175
If I have $8,000 to send

142
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,223
Maybe

143
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,527
There's not a fox

144
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,319
Embargo going on with Russia

145
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:58,719
You can also order from Indiana

146
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,607
You get a pain in your leg

147
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:10,495
Can I ask you what the point of Israelites came arrows what I'm saying is

148
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,823
Now I know I don't want a pet

149
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,871
No I want to fish

150
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,895
Person

151
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:19,455
Scared all the time

152
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,271
My play with it I feed a little fish food

153
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,159
I grind up freeze-dried steak

154
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,951
That's what I do

155
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:36,607
Lest anyone think they were making fun of something could be happening

156
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,887
Offended on behalf of fish

157
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,167
People one

158
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,447
I bet you know some

159
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:44,031
I did some research into this

160
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:48,383
The information you can find about fish people

161
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,431
Fish hybrids

162
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,783
All unsourced

163
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:58,623
Heather's onelink I was able to find to an article in Daily Mail

164
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,647
Which of the

165
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:02,719
Daily Mail

166
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:03,743
Hackers

167
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,535
And today I

168
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,119
Goddamn Murdoch's

169
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,191
The article that they linked to is about this guy

170
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,471
Who is a genetic

171
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,007
Scientist

172
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:16,799
He

173
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:19,871
The article was about how this guy believes that humans

174
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,151
Were the result of

175
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,687
Monkeys and pigs f******

176
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,223
Make sense

177
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,551
Actually you know what

178
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,599
I want to give you some more rope to hang yourself

179
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,159
I'm not

180
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,999
That's the end of your research

181
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:39,071
No no. Yeah it is

182
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,119
Alex Jones

183
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,679
An article that was about

184
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,471
Chimpanzees

185
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,751
And pigs having sex

186
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,031
Creating human

187
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,823
Evidence

188
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,103
Official people

189
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,639
Great

190
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:53,919
Okay

191
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,967
Were there were there

192
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:59,039
Also

193
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:01,087
Considering that whenever he was

194
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,111
Who's on the

195
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:02,879
The courthouse steps

196
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,439
Trial

197
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:08,255
Interview

198
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,303
After being ass like

199
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,399
How do you feel about

200
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,287
Moment On You

201
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,639
Just read it

202
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,431
One of those

203
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,247
Was very unhappy

204
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,039
About chimeras

205
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,831
Intellectual publication

206
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,599
Yeah

207
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,439
Here's the deal

208
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:41,535
That is the kind of stuff we can find that fish people

209
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:47,935
Stop is what we can find on any random

210
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,263
Just cuz sometimes

211
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,895
It's it's interesting that you brought up

212
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,175
That press

213
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:58,943
Yes

214
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:03,295
Because that's what we're going to be talking about Alex Jones

215
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,831
On Friday

216
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,879
Put out a video of one of the

217
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,951
Fakest looking press conferences I've ever seen in my life

218
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,743
There were maybe

219
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,511
10

220
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:17,375
212 reporters I would say maybe 15 from being generous it's very sparse

221
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,959
He gives you give the press conference that is

222
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:21,727
Ostensibly

223
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,263
Supposed to be about

224
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,031
The Cay

225
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,567
Just children

226
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,335
And all that

227
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,871
Erase

228
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:34,271
Chimeras a little bit everything except

229
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,855
Come up a little bit

230
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,159
I know that it is

231
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:41,951
People

232
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:42,975
They might be

233
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:49,119
Teresa

234
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,655
Chrissy has a tank

235
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,959
So

236
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,199
Does custody suit

237
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:04,991
Now we are

238
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,271
A Wyatt

239
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,831
Alex started talking about it

240
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:17,279
Personal life is not for us even as we discussed this

241
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,303
Talk about it

242
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,351
Raz-Kids

243
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,727
Satire

244
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,735
When you confusion tell by your voice

245
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:48,255
His personal life is no longer

246
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,071
Congratulations Alex you're doing this to yourself

247
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,375
Here is the beginning

248
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,935
Beginning

249
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,543
Alex Jones

250
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,311

251
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,175

254
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,631
I need to file for divorce

255
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:31,263
Four separate times you file to take him away

256
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,335
System

257
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:50,975
No way is that true

258
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:57,375
Closing argument

259
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:03,775
Now

260
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,223
That's why

261
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,503
You guys

262
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,087
Actor

263
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:21,439
Dial Alex

264
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:34,239
A big Corporation

265
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:40,895
Is it who's it doesn't he's already way off track

266
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,943
Please

267
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,247

268
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,135
There's no there's nothing back

269
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,415
He's just a serving

270
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,463
She's not

271
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:58,047
I actually think Alex is website

272
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,839
He said he was going to post the documents

273
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,887
Posted

274
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:04,703
I even searched

275
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:09,311
What infowars.com

276
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:13,407
It specifically says powered by Google

277
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,223
On his divorce

278
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,759
To see if there's like some article

279
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:20,063
Anyting about like

280
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,623

00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,671
But I would like to read you a list

282
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:28,255
Of article titled come up when you search divorce

283
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,559
Infowars.com

284
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,095
The war on men

285
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:34,655
10 ways masculinity is under attack

286
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,935
By Paul Joseph Watson

287
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,215
Another article

288
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:40,799
Lee Ann McAdoo and Alex Jones respond to dating allegation

289
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,871
This one's from 2012 this headline

290
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:47,711
Review Michelle and Barack Obama's divorce papers

291
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:49,759
Diddy

292
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,783
He didn't

293
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:54,111
Another one

294
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:58,719
Nope

295
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,255
Another headline

296
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:05,631
Will men finally start like men again

297
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:08,703
A lot more racism is happening

298
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:09,983
Batman

299
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,031
This is one of the headline 420

300
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:12,799
16

301
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:17,151
Quote I'm considering going after the clintons marriage

302
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,039
Headlights

303
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,855

By Paul Joseph

305
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,951
Spoiler alert the article is

306
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:32,511
Women aren't women anymore that make sense

307
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,559
Men are men women are women

308
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:39,423
And then the final one of the final article that I have pulled from

309
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,447
The search was

310
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,215
Photo

311
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:44,031
Michelle more muscular than the president

312
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,871
What should you count trumpets tilt

313
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,175
Is that

314
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,711
Is that why they

315
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,759
Do muscular

316
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:56,575
Yeah so Michelle Michelle finally beat the

317
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,343
Fish it out of her

318
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,135
It must be

319
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:05,535
So he's not really he's not dealing with the he's not providing any in

320
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,095
Information he's just broadly a certain thing

321
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:12,959
And then not following through the trial other than

322
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,751
How the news media

323
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:18,079
Lies Rodgers trial

324
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,359
It's Sarah.

325
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:22,687
He actually kind of has the kernel of a good point there

326
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,223
In that they did

327
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:27,551
A lot of the reporting on the trial was

328
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:33,951
About how he ate a big bowl of chili and couldn't remember his kids teachers name like that

329
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:35,999
Clown on that

330
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,303
Of course people are going to make fun of that

331
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,327
But it didn't

332
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,631
A lot of reporting was not substantiated

333
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:48,287
It was more about hey look Alex Jones is a crazy person and he's being forced to testify

334
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:52,895
I'm has a point but he goes the wrong direction with that fair

335
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,943
Write any plays a

336
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,223
Massive addictive game

337
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,039
The kids really

338
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,319
Only what the left

339
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,623
Because we know he's

340
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,391
Classical

341
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,927
Is a libertarian

342
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,743
True libertarian Victor

343
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,279
Absolutely

344
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,047
Call Joseph

345
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:13,631
Who's really really afraid that masculinity is in crisis

346
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:21,311
Bingo

347
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:27,711
Baby that article should read reasons why

348
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,551
Scared all the time

349
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:36,415
And I didn't really cut out anything this is just

350
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,719
Again segmented

351
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,511
I think it's a fake breasts

352
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,583
Smells bad

353
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,631
It has the wrestling promos

354
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:48,959
It kind of does cuz the people who ask questions

355
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,495
Until the end

356
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:54,591
BNB goes off the rails a little bit but the people were asking questions

357
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:57,663
Like if I were in the Press

358
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,943
And I was there

359
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,223
I would be

360
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,247
I'll be going to

361
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,015
Pound on him

362
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,111
There's so many questions you could ask that would be

363
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,903
So hard for him to answer

364
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:10,463
I made us all very tame question

365
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,743
And then on top of that

366
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,279
Just abusing them

367
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:18,143
No one is like f*** you doing

368
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:24,287
Places really trade for that like if you go to if you and look if you're in the White House Press brief

369
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:25,823
Sean Spicer

370
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,871
She says a word every one of the rooms

371
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,175
You're f****** lying you

372
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:34,271
Editors are allowed to do that to Barack Obama

373
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:36,063
But it's not because of race

374
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:40,927
Selling a business

375
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:41,951
You know

376
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:46,559
Good

377
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:49,119
I totally agree

378
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,143
Defense

379
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,423
Of the

380
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,263
Throwing absolutely

381
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,543
Not writing

382
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,079
But not the voice of the oppressed

383
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,359
Costume shoes

384
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,383
Choose anyway

385
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,407
The next one

386
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,199
Alex Jones makes a statement

387
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,223
Are you reading

388
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,247
You can tell that

389
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,015
Because

390
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,319
Kind of an edible

391
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:11,903
He thought a piece of paper this is a statement

392
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,719
About how everyone's wrong about what

393
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:15,999
Course in this

394
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:17,791
So

395
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:20,095
Here's my basic statement that I wrote

396
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,375
On this whole situation

397
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,911
I want to respond

398
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,471
Somebody else wrote it for you

399
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,823
SWAT

400
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,103
Every two years ago

401
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:43,903
Withdrawal limit

402
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,975
Supervisor

403
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,423
That's Austra

404
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:06,687
Began three years ago fishery agree we should remain as joint

405
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:13,087
Conservator effectively a change of 10 miles

406
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:19,488
As only the judge will decide what amount of time with her children

407
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:23,840
That the judge will carefully consider the various schedule that have been put in place

408
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:27,680
Last two years of each of us does appropriate

409
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:31,520
German

410
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,056
Schedule

411
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:35,360
Regard to their own wishes

412
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:48,160
So this is the last instance of him being professional throughout the entire

413
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,464
Episode

414
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:55,840
The chest

415
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:59,680
You really really hit a lot of those points I don't like the way

416
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:06,080
Conservator

417
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,872
Minute of reading

418
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:16,832
Obfuscating like crazy is really muddying the waters because he like we have joint custody

419
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,368
Technically that is true

420
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,648
But she is

421
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:23,232
The conservator or the person who is in charge

422
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:28,864
Primary parent now

423
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,144
Isn't not allowed

424
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,960
And they can stay with him

425
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:33,984
She says he's

426
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,544
I'm not sure she's actually allowed to do that

427
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:39,104
Apparently

428
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,408
Apparently he does have to have supervision

429
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,968
Stuff like that which is

430
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,552
A complete inverse of the way it was before

431
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,320
Supervision before

432
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,880
The idea that

433
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:53,440
Doesn't seem to understand the jury either

434
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,208
Sequestered

435
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:57,024
Like you don't understand that they're not watching Colbert

436
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:03,424
I'm seeing these like for Trails what's going on entirely on what's in the courtroom

437
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,960
Rite Aid if they go in

438
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:07,008
With one situation being true

439
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,056
Is the main parent

440
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,592
Sam has the right to

441
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:11,616
Choose all these things about

442
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:12,384
Kids

443
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,432
Bob louder there where they live

444
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:17,248
I am at the end of the other way

445
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:19,040
That means there was something

446
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:19,808
Compelling

447
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:20,832
In that courtroom

448
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,928
Probably just listening to Alex Jones

449
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,208
Holyshit

450
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:31,584
George Soros is responsible for getting good

451
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:40,544
Quoted as saying that he smokes marijuana once a year to lay Siege how strong it's getting

452
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,616
More effective for you

453
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,152
Kids from doing drugs

454
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,944
The Dare program

455
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,504
Fear of course fear of global

456
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,552
Absolutely one of those

457
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,368
Bulshit and the other one

458
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,392
Isabel

459
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,160
Globalist

460
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:02,048
Open up Friday

461
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,072
That's the

462
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:03,840
That one was

463
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:07,936
Wasn't in on Friday

464
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,240
Probably probably

465
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:13,312
I think he recorded this video and then probably

466
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:22,016
It was really tough to figure out what was going on inside the head of

467
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:24,064
Paul Joseph Watson who's hosting

468
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,600
Armand Owen Shroyer

469
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:27,648
Cuz he's doing his live 325

470
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,416
Michelle

471
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:30,720
Both of them were sort of like

472
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,256
Trump

473
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:35,328
Globalist

474
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,352
What

475
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,656
Dewey do

476
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:42,496
We hate

477
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,264
Global

478
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:47,104
It really really texting this whole premise that they

479
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,664
Try to sell that is like we have no invest

480
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,944
Rendon Trump himself

481
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,736
We just like what he does

482
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:56,576
Yeah now that he is said I'm a nationalist and a globalist

483
00:24:57,344 --> 00:25:02,720
This is their out this is

484
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:04,768
The way that they escaped from

485
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:05,536
From this nightmare

486
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:09,376
I don't think they want to be though cuz

487
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,424
There's no there's no champion

488
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,752
And it undercuts all of the narratives they've sold up to this point like

489
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:15,776
Remember they were saying

490
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:18,080
But those narratives

491
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:21,408
No don't they didn't they were very compelling like Alex

492
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,176
It was claiming

493
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:25,504
That Donald Trump was a 30-year

494
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,552
Secret Patriot

495
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:30,624
Sleeper Cell Patriots

496
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,720
Typical back in time you were f****** wrong this

497
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:37,536
Holt

498
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:42,144
He was co-opted by the powers-that-be volcano

499
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:42,912
If you think

500
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,448
Fish people are fine

501
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,776
Yeah

502
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,128
Why not even just start throwing out the old timers

503
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,248
It's true all four days might as well

504
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,784
At the very least as attention deficit

505
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:03,648
Yeah you listen to talk

506
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,976
Using like neuro-linguistic programming

507
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:11,328
And I want to do it

508
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,096
More in-depth

509
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:14,144
Report on about John Rappaport

510
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,704
Tricks you can use

511
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,240
That are basically

512
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:19,776
Suggestion

513
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:21,568
Subliminal

514
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,336
Suggesting

515
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,872
And if you're not paying

516
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:25,152
It sounds like a normal

517
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:30,272
She might be worms

518
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:33,856
First female president the absolute worst

519
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:39,488
Kush

520
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:43,328
Which is stronger because of George.

521
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,120
Wordplay

522
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:47,680
Almost

523
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,960
All

524
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:52,800
Could be sort of summed up by saying everyone is lying about Alex Jones

525
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,616
So they were going to get into that here

526
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,968
Cuz I was just blown away

527
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,040
Horsepower on me

528
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,136
Social workers

529
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:10,976
Alcohol drug testing

530
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,512
You're a wonderful dad

531
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,792
Put a few people Tacoma

532
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,704
50% of my ex-wife

533
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:26,080
I had my kids

534
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,360
Am I taking them

535
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,896
Alienator

536
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:31,712
With the literal definition of alienation

537
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,480
Was engaged

538
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,856
Yourself

539
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:40,672
All I want

540
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,232
Is the truth to come out on Oliver

541
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:44,768
Because

542
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,304
File for divorce

543
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,584
I didn't figure this

544
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:58,592
My children away from my ex-wife and gave them exclusively to me

545
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,688
I love

546
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,504
What the f***

547
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:13,440
WhatsApp

548
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:16,000
It's mind-boggling to suggest that

549
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,024
And Court

550
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,560
Things don't have proof

551
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,608
That's why Court exist

552
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,912
It's not a perfect system

553
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:26,240
But you can't assert things in court that you can't backup

554
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:29,568
But if you get caught doing that during contempt of court

555
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,336
Evidence

556
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,640
Thrown out you might do a night

557
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:33,920
The Pokey

558
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:34,944
Perkins

559
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,760
Bright

560
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,320
If you're rich that I wanted

561
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:42,880
To cover this even though we've been staying away from

562
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,208
Situation was because

563
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:49,024
Highly Illustrated

564
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:49,792
Fuct

565
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,328
In court

566
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:56,448
The propaganda skills that he has argued in our last episode that

567
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,776
You know even if he gets destroyed by Chobani it might be a good thing

568
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:03,616
You can see here he's making an argument that his audience

569
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,384
Will like

570
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,456
Yes it will appeal to them cuz they're not engaging with what

571
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,992
You're not the reality of what's going on

572
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,528
He's really good at

573
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:12,064
That he is a propagandist

574
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,088
Spinner

575
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,368
And then when he's out

576
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:16,416
Street talkin to people

577
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,536
He can't win in court

578
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,072
But you can win on the street

579
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:25,888
Do you win on a in a verbal street fight

580
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:29,472
As it were

581
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,264
Formal education

582
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:32,544
Not really a strong

583
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,336
Street smarts

584
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:37,920
As long as they're involved he's right up on

585
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:44,064
But he's also not very streets don't nobody can handle the aquarium's quite like like

586
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:47,904
He's swamped swamped with the best of them I don't know

587
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:51,744
Got to realize that he's

588
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,512
He's not very good at you

589
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,304
Using lawyers but

590
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:56,096
Next clip

591
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,400
Plays the victim

592
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,424
Really hard

593
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,008
Okay from a truck

594
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:10,944
Is one of the first modern trials read a corporate establishment mercenary media

595
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,016
Birch in the

596
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:16,320
There comes a truck but also

597
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:21,696
Who are the first trials that has corporate media adversity

598
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,720
Okay

599
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:31,424
Annie bratayley anytime of celebrities on trials

600
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:39,616
Third assertion for him to make and it's just him trying to

601
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,920
Give credibility to his victim status

602
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:42,688
Yeah

603
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:43,712
You come to truck

604
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:55,232
Accelerated the demise of the corporate media you guys Wonder

605
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:58,816
Why you have willingly assist why you don't have support just because you

606
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,656
Why do people

607
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:04,704
Before you do that

608
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:16,736
It's going absolutely

609
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:17,504
What is ex-wife

610
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:21,088
You are actually not using emotion

611
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,648
And all the experts

612
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:27,744
Hold on hold on can we

613
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:28,768
What

614
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:29,792
Is he saying

615
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:33,120
Are those words related to each other

616
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,144
No

617
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,480
You think that everybody in the media said that it was going bad for his ex-wife

618
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:50,528
And that's the only thing that they got right

619
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,088
I don't think so

620
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,904
I don't remember anybody saying things are going bad for

621
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,560
Oh s*** things are going real bad for Alex

622
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,352
For AJ

623
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,688
Yeah

624
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:22,016
Yeah I think the only

625
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:28,160
The only stuff that I saw that would sort of validate that is just like they're both

626
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:28,928
Open trouble

627
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:32,512
Let like it doesn't unlock don't look good for either of them

628
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:34,048
The only losers in this

629
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:34,816
Situation

630
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,888
And

631
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,168
The truck the truck made

632
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:42,240
Are any of the s*** Alex Jones

633
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:50,432
Driving home

634
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:53,504
Elizabeth's children

635
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,344
All of it

636
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,720
She is 30% off

637
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:10,400
For no reason

638
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,936
There are plenty

639
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:16,032
I also

640
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:21,152
He drops that there there's no reason and then earlier he had said that his wife

641
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:26,272
Wanted to divorce for no reason I mean I understand that that's what it looks like to you but you don't

642
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,040
Really

643
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:30,624
Care about other people in a meaningful way so you don't understand what they're going

644
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,160
Human emotions

645
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:34,976
Add stuff

646
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:37,536
It's tough but he makes the argument

647
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:43,168
Repeatedly throughout this that he is in fact the one who is the victim of alienation

648
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:47,264
Which is which was a central part of his ex-wife

649
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:50,080
That he was turning their kids

650
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:50,848
Against her

651
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,128
Yeah

652
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:56,480
Global

653
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:59,040
Sure from what I've been able to find

654
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,064
From

655
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:02,368
Coverage

656
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:04,160
Cheap is right

657
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,952
But it seems like that is

658
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:08,768
And it definitely fits his pattern of behavior

659
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,632
Now we don't know whole lot about her maybe she was turning them against him too I don't know

660
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:14,912
But

661
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:20,032
What's fun I was trying to find like the court documents cuz Alex

662
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:21,824
And this next clip is again going to say

663
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,104
Court documents

664
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:27,456
He's going to make them public you know what you know where they're talking a lot about this

665
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:29,248
Divorce Stormfront

666
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,040
Oh yeah

667
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,576
I don't know what's

668
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:35,904
It's a Nazi

669
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,952
Bored

670
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:41,024
What does Alex Jones ex-wife is Jewish

671
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,584
And there's a lot of people

672
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,400
There's a lot of people connect community

673
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:48,960
Who believed that she was like his Handler

674
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:50,496
And because of her

675
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,800
Speak out against Israel

676
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:55,360
Even though he knew that Israel was the real problem with

677
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:57,664
And the reason that they thought that

678
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,224
Is because globalism is toad

679
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,272
Wow

680
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:04,576
So

681
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,464
Learn about this

682
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,280
Sorry that it is

683
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:19,680
It's almost I'm a leaving you

684
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:27,616
It is a Billy Joel album

685
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:29,920
Yeah we're basically this

686
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:33,504
Hitler knot it called

687
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,552
At work

688
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:46,304
Great Alex is finally going to be able to tell the truth

689
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,144
But even trying to tell for years now that he's out of the situation

690
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:55,008
The bunch of the really smart other commenters jump anime like

691
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:55,776
Hey guys

692
00:35:56,032 --> 00:36:00,896
Don't want to ruin your fun but his new wife is Jewish to

693
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:05,760
Alright

694
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:10,880
It's really fun when like hateful bigots are stupid

695
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,928
Ghetto

696
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:16,256
Tapas bar

697
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:19,328
Is the

698
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:20,864
Quickest sign to

699
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,632
Knowing that some

700
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:25,728
Booksmart

701
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,544
But it's not a thing

702
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,872
Mike cernovich is

703
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:35,712
Monster

704
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:36,736
He is a

705
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,272
Chimera of a

706
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,040
Amman

707
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,832
And

708
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:42,112
Whatever it is that

709
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,648
Another man

710
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,000
He's just a

711
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,280
To do to file

712
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:53,888
So I'm going to skip the nightclub where you just again repeat the

713
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:55,168
That you can get these documents

714
00:36:59,008 --> 00:36:59,520
He discusses

715
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:00,800
How what's going on is

716
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,592
Reality is becoming

717
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:03,616
Reversed

718
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:05,664
Those are inversion of reality

719
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,456
And then goes on to

720
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:08,480
I am

721
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:10,272
That is very reminiscent

722
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,064
Obi-Wan Kenobi

723
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,672
Unreality

724
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,512
Spectacle

725
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:22,304
You got spinach

726
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:26,400
And then so it's probably okay for you to do it

727
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:29,216
You covered with something

728
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:32,032
I'm rubber

729
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:32,800
You're ugly

730
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:42,016
Would 80 + million viewers in West

731
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,040
In one week

732
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,832
Thank you all

733
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:49,440
Has only intensified

734
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:51,488
Across the world C

735
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:01,984
Bosses attempt to put me in jail if they were

736
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:08,384
The internet

737
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,200
I'm standing up for this country and I'll tell him the truth

738
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:15,040
Mysterious men and women

739
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:19,136
Nationalism

740
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:21,440
Awakening again

741
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,976
Corporate

742
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:26,304
Swept Away

743
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,584
Flooding into the gutters

744
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,632
Would you like to

745
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:31,680
To see your children Alex

746
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:39,872
Okay alright is Mom on that topic but he really wants to make the point that if you strike me down

747
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:41,408
More powerful

748
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:45,504
Yeah and I'm lying about his audience

749
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,552
Stressed out

750
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:49,088
There's no way

751
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:50,368
Literally no way

752
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,160
No

753
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:58,304
If you had 80 million people who listen to the show

754
00:38:58,816 --> 00:38:59,584
You would be

755
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,632
Flooded with people that Prescott

756
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:05,728
The courthouse would have been beatlemania

757
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:09,056
In front of that Courthouse it would have been A Hard Day's Night

758
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:11,616
Just being chased down the street by young girls

759
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,736
Which I think is what he thinks goes on all the time anyway

760
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:19,808
You don't have 80 million people

761
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:20,832
You got it

762
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:21,600
Consider that

763
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:24,416
Probably half of your audience is fake

764
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,952
And then another like

765
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:26,720
Quarter

766
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:29,024
It's probably people like me who listen to hate you

767
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:29,792
So

768
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,072
You know

769
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,352
And there's one more guy

770
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,032
So

771
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:43,104
Combative

772
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:45,664
To these people who were were videotaping

773
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:49,504
He tries to

774
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,552
This reporter asked

775
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:53,088
If you hate

776
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,368
The Press so much

777
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,160
Why are you here

778
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:59,232
A very obvious question

779
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,512
The first question

780
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,280
Kicks office

781
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,560
Ring of keys

782
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:04,096
Does not answer

783
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:07,680
Is a little bit and then gif

784
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:09,216
Really f****** abusive

785
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:17,152
A lot more coming in the near future as we move forward in defense of this Republic defense of freedom and defenseman

786
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:23,296
Infowars.com take all the viewers illustrious out there

787
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:33,536
Some of them might be real

788
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:39,936
Normal

789
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:50,688
Let's Pretend Walker

790
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:03,232
And lie about me and my family.

791
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,000
Show

792
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:14,240
Something real people after watching

793
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:18,336
To what you said and what you question and what you did

794
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:22,176
I really get back to the abusive just want to point out that that's not trolling

795
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:28,832
No vest setting a trap kind of

796
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:30,624
The most generous

797
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,976
Call it is

798
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,048
Sure

799
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:42,400
What is

800
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:44,448
Okay okay so

801
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,240
So in his mind

802
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:47,520
Point of this

803
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,312
Is 2

804
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:51,872
Hold the media accountable

805
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:53,151
Because

806
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:54,175
Twist his words

807
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,455
Since his words are now on

808
00:41:58,527 --> 00:41:59,039
Quote him

809
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:02,623
Then we can always go back to the tape

810
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:03,647
Can be like

811
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:05,951
See this is what I said

812
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:06,719
I said this

813
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:09,535
Say that

814
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:14,399
He's now said that he's only going to do interviews that are live

815
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:19,007
Or that are he's going to himself fully record all of them

816
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,031
Okay people

817
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:23,103
Can cut and paste is his words

818
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:25,919
And lying to take him out of context

819
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:27,967
We don't need to lie.

820
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:32,831
What does an episode like 40 of the show all contacts

821
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:35,903
You don't want people taking you in contacts

822
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:38,207
You kind of don't want people act

823
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:38,975
Truly listening

824
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:40,511
Right right

825
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:43,583
People aren't going to go away

826
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:49,727
He's getting he's humbled

827
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:53,823
He's not

828
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:54,847
It's going to be a

829
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,639
But

830
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:57,663
Little bit of

831
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:10,719
Funding

832
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:15,583

833
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,399
Dick

834
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:20,191
That was a very legitimate question

835
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:24,543
Any real questions

836
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:25,567
The very legitimate Quest

837
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:29,407
Listen to know if they are

838
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,711

It's very close to salt

842
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,439
Very close

843
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,023
From the unicorn man in the back

Corporate media lies and they go to school make her about this

They know the truth and I say why does the media say that why does the media say this and explain their not the media

00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:59,423
Current situation

886
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:05,055

888
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:08,895

Are you going to bring your mom or I always tell my kids to feel their hands

You're going to take a bath or it's time to fill your head

905
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:58,559
Are you even talking to us anymore

906
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:05,215
I realize I could consciously there got off on a Hyundai hulakai arant

907
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:06,495
If you came into my life

908
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:07,775
Beer in my mind

909
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:09,055
And that is because the next question

910
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:10,079
Is about

911
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:10,847
Chobani lawsuit

912
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:15,199
Jesus pay more lawsuits coming at you after the Chobani

913
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:21,599
Lawyers

914
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:25,951
Nope

915
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:28,767
Corporate strategy

916
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:32,351
New York Federal Reserve

917
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,631
Board member of

918
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:40,287
No he's not part of those things

919
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:41,823
Your lawyers

920
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:46,687
I think you are going out to things that aren't real I think he is involved with Alexa

921
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:47,711
School lunch stuff

922
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:53,855
New York Federal Reserve

923
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:55,135
That

924
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:56,159
I don't

925
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,695
I don't think he's talked to lawyers

926
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:59,231
I think he's making that up

927
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,279
I think that he's just being blustery

928
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:02,559
I don't really

929
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:04,095
Because I can't imagine a lawyer

930
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,119
Talking to about it

931
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,143
Is Ambien like

932
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:09,215
Look into whether this is

933
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:12,287
Is true or not act like it is

934
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:14,079
No lawyer would you

935
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:15,615
Disbarred

936
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:17,919
Let's let's not say no

937
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,199

Let's say if you're a friend of Alex Jones

939
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:25,087
Likes

940
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,927
You might be giving him bad advice because you also don't believe it real

941
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:33,023
Mike cernovich is a lawyer's that's possible that the two of them have had conversations

942
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:35,071
I talked to my lawyer

943
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:36,095
Solid case

944
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:38,399
Yeah which

945
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:42,751
How can you be a lawyer

946
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:45,055
Although although that is a really good question

947
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:48,895
So how can you be

948
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:49,919
You're right

949
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:52,735
The answer.

950
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:59,903
Like what do you do when you see the lawyers in court defending the

951
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:01,183
The travel ban and all that

952
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:02,207
It's so bleak

953
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,607
To tell that you shouldn't be doing

954
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:11,935
So those lawyers are doing it just for the money

955
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,519
Best go

956
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:17,311
If you're Alex Jones

957
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:18,079
Lawyer

958
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:19,871
You are not going to

959
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:20,639
You tell him

960
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:21,919
Hey this is bad for you

961
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:23,199
Because

962
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:29,343
That's a good point going to tell him is whatever it is he needs

963
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,135
So he will continue writing those checks

964
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:33,695
At this point is almost a dream

965
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:36,255
Client

966
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,279
So much work

967
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:39,327
So much Billings

968
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:40,607
Hours of it

969
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,143
I can't imagine like

970
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:45,471
You don't even know

971
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,799
He's just going to talk

972
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:51,871
Woods

973
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:54,687
Just be it okay if we go to court

974
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:55,455
About this

975
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:56,991
You don't say

976
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:58,015
S***

977
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:58,783
Ankle

978
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:00,831
You shut your mouth

979
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,623
Going to get that lawyer

980
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:06,719
Court is going

981
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:07,487
2

982
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:11,839
Lulu's crazy yarn

983
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:15,679
That is not true at all he's going to reference Breitbart articles

984
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:18,751
Yeah

985
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:21,055
Isn't it going to be a delight

986
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:23,615
Yeah if that is why

987
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:28,479
Take a week off

988
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,807
Pastor watch

989
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:36,671
Oh my God that would be a good fast

990
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:38,207
That would be amazing

991
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:39,487
Broadcast live

992
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:40,767
I don't think they would allow us to do

993
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:45,119
In the courtroom

994
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:52,287
Reporters like it a basketball game play-by-play

995
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,079
Horse fall on that one

996
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:55,359
Did not answer the question

997
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:56,383
Answer back to this

998
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,663
He has more to say

999
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:00,991
Cuz I was Ludacris

1000
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:05,087

Lawsuit

1003
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:23,775
About the report at the computer cabinet

1004
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:27,359
Yogurt

Other people's report

1010
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:51,167
What happens if when we get attacked

1011
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:53,983
The liquor ship and support just goes up exponentially

1012
00:51:58,847 --> 00:51:59,871
Support

1013
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:06,527

That we're also going to

1023
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:44,927
Defeat turkey

1024
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:47,231
Do you think that he's upset about the Kurds

1025
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:50,815
Because of like the pasteurization process of time

1026
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:55,167
Well do you know it

1027
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:57,727
What's up

1028
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:00,031
Globalist globalism

1029
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:03,871
Hamdi ulukaya as giving a lot of money

1030
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:05,151

Because all that they're murder

1034
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:16,415
Kind of smart

1035
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:18,207
It like do a countersuit

1036
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:19,743
Because as I said

1037
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:22,559
If you going in for the defamation lawsuit

1038
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:24,607
He can't introduce all this crazy show

1039
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:25,887
Is outside

1040
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:28,447
The scope of the

1041
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:31,007
In order to

1042
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:33,055

Soros

1045
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:38,431
All this s***

1046
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:39,967
Right not in the

1047
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:40,735
Being brought against

1048
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:42,271
So that's like I said

1049
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:43,039
It's called

1050
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:44,831
Yes

1051
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:47,391
Could you could lose that case to put

1052
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:48,927
But if he gets

1053
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:53,535
Absolutely

1054
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:55,071
Questioning this cell

1055
00:53:58,399 --> 00:54:02,495
You don't even have to work because you know the case is over like

1056
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:03,263
You right up

1057
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:04,799
Like you write up

1058
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:06,591
Bad book report

1059
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:12,991
Basically Joe

1060
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:16,063
Ambiano what if you are that lawyer

1061
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:20,159
If you are that checks out

1062
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:22,975
Cares

1063
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:23,999
Now the Alex

1064
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:25,023
To be honest

1065
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:26,815
Time now

1066
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:28,095
It's got to be excited

1067
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:32,703
Mr Smith Goes to Washington boner all up in arms

1068
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:35,007
For it for like

1069
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:36,031
20 years baby

1070
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:38,591
Look at it

1071
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:40,383
He's so slippery

1072
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:43,199
That making predictions about him is very difficult

1073
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:46,015
But it feels like we've entered the third Act

1074
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,575
Okay

1075
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:49,343
What we

1076
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:51,135
When we started this podcast

1077
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:52,671
In January

1078
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:58,559
Four months ago unfortunately

1079
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:04,191
He's a hateful dude we're just going to document tube and make fun of him

1080
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:10,591
Yeah we got it right on the decline

1081
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:13,663
This is going to turn into

1082
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:15,199
This f****** guy is

1083
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:17,759
He's ruining his own career

1084
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:20,063
2

1085
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:25,183
Assume

1086
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:28,255
Does it end well

1087
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:31,327
I think I think it ends okay

1088
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:32,095
Just Wynn

1089
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:37,471
Everybody

1090
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:43,359
Beauty and the Beast

1091
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:47,967
Stride that's what we're dealing with we're dealing with one of the other Hamlet turns into Gaston

1092
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:50,783
Blob

1093
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:53,599
Jojo

1094
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:54,367
Anyway

1095
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:56,415
Like

1096
00:55:57,951 --> 00:56:00,511
It's just like I understand

1097
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:02,815
Question was about to Bonnie

1098
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:03,583
And what have you

1099
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:05,887
You could have just

1100
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:09,727
Working on that but you know what we're here to talk about today

1101
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:11,007
Little children

1102
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:12,287
But that's the opposite

1103
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:17,151
What time is it in Boston gal

1104
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:18,943
Any any

1105
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:22,271
Possible subject is not lost

1106
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:23,039
This trial

1107
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,879
You have to claim that he didn't

1108
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:29,951
Anyway

1109
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:32,255
I wouldn't be shocked if

1110
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:33,279
Somehow he tries

1111
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:36,351
Make it so that in the

1112
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:38,911
They also have to give him custody

1113
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:41,727
They're trying

1114
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:44,287
Take my

1115
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:45,823
That's not globalist

1116
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:49,663
Single Jew

1117
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:51,199
Who happens to be his ex-wife

1118
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:56,319
Stormfront really full of a lot of really intelligent critique

1119
00:56:57,343 --> 00:57:00,671
I hate that place anyway next question is back

1120
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:05,791
Question that comes in and there

1121
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:06,815
The status of

1122
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:07,583
The custody is

1123
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:08,351
It's like what is

1124
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:09,119
The situation

1125
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:09,887
Between

1126
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:13,983
You going to get to have the kids on weekends or what

1127
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:17,311
The Beatles and you'll see how well

1128
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:21,919
Regarding

1129
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:28,831
So what was he

1130
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:31,391
Exact

1131
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:32,159
Decision of

1132
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:32,927
The judge

1133
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:33,695
Alex

1134
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:37,535
Decision of the judge

1135
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:41,631
A different question

1136
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:43,167
What's the

1137
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:43,935
Exact

1138
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:44,703
Right right

1139
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:46,751
He's not a

1140
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:49,567
Text wife it's hot

1141
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:52,127
Soul and supervised visits

1142
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:53,407
Okay

1143
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:58,527
And so because that happened

1144
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:00,319
I was always just trying to get

1145
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:04,415
Horst 2005

1146
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:12,351
Arizona

1147
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:16,447
Big Lots

1148
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:22,079
I would argue that's a real lab

1149
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:31,295
The social

1150
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:45,119
Are you on here if you're really cool.

1151
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:55,615
Set an alarm called you a narcissist

1152
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:10,463
At all

1153
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:11,743
Perceived

1154
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:12,511
The past

1155
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:13,279
Situation

1156
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:14,303
Since their divorce

1157
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:16,095
It wasn't 2005

1158
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:17,119
And I think

1159
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:17,887
Dimetrodon

1160
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:21,471
Yeah but listen

1161
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:23,775
His is understanding

1162
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:24,799
Suspect

1163
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:31,199
He would have had to have those other kids with her after they were divorced

1164
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:33,759
You know like

1165
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:38,879
As we've already

1166
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:41,439
He is not willing to give the benefit of the doubt

1167
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:42,719
Let's say

1168
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:46,303
Maxine Waters or Nancy Pelosi when they have a slip of the tongue

1169
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:52,703
It's only fair

1170
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:56,287
Living on

1171
00:59:56,543 --> 01:00:00,383
These female

1172
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:01,407
I think he would be able to

1173
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:05,759
Is that we would definitely dance around

1174
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:10,623
This planet is flat

1175
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:13,439
Staples

1176
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:16,511
Grounds

1177
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:28,031
First one

1178
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:35,711
She was in Rome for a while and then

1179
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:38,783
The third one and then we live on one of them

1180
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:45,439
As I prefer to call it.

1181
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:49,791
You might have noticed

1182
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:55,167
Reporter whose little rebuttal and w

1183
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:58,751
Give another shot

1184
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:02,847
Where we at

1185
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:15,391
With where

1186
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,207
The judge

1187
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:22,303
By the way

1188
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:30,495
That's Cody

1189
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:33,567
Otherwise

1190
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:34,591
Bart

1191
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:36,383
I'm seeing his kids ever again

1192
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:43,039
The judge was correct in this for what he is referring to is that

1193
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:44,831
She refused to let anything

1194
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:47,135
Any political

1195
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:51,231
Contact because you didn't want to bias the tree against

1196
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:53,535
There was a video

1197
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:54,815
Right right

1198
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:57,375
I mean we are still in Texas

1199
01:01:58,143 --> 01:01:58,911
Let's truth but it's

1200
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:00,191
Liberal Austin

1201
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:01,727
Occupy

1202
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:04,799
A video that the

1203
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:05,567
Tried to

1204
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:06,335
Emperor in

1205
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:10,943
Video of him and his son throwing darts

1206
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:13,759
Hillary Clinton's face on a dartboard

1207
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:15,551
And she was trying to demonstrate

1208
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:17,087
This is like

1209
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:19,647
But you didn't

1210
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:20,671
Who played because

1211
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:22,719
If someone was a Hillary supporter

1212
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:24,767
They would unfavorably bias them

1213
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:28,351
And if you were anti-hillary it would

1214
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:31,679
Wrecked I think that's right but that's what he saying

1215
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:34,495
Also like a lot of his other videos where he's drunk

1216
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:35,519
Talkingshit like that

1217
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:37,055
They didn't she didn't let them play

1218
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:38,079
Really

1219
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:40,383
Extent of them

1220
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:41,151
That

1221
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:42,687
We might think of

1222
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:46,783
That's what he's trying to say

1223
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:47,807
Answering the question

1224
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:49,855
Going to not answer

1225
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:50,623
For another man

1226
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:59,583
On what does jury do

1227
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:02,143
She is still exactly

1228
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:04,703
Show all the

1229
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:06,239
Telephone

1230
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:11,103
I just wanted to give Mom some more time

1231
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:14,431
4/4

1232
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:16,735
Social worker

1233
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:22,111
She called Dad Robertson have any children

1234
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:28,511
Because

1235
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:39,519
What's natto job is worth

1236
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:40,799
Not sure about my ex-wife

1237
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:51,039
Situations

1238
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:56,415
You

1239
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,951
Little girl

1240
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:02,815
Play the football future

1241
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:08,447
Can probably recite

1242
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:09,471
What he's about to say

1243
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:10,751
Verbatim

1244
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:19,967
I'm not going to cut me out saying this here

1245
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:23,295
He says that every single time that this Colbert thing

1246
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:25,087
Brought up

1247
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:27,135
I'm not

1248
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:29,183
It says I'm at

1249
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:30,463
Sort of

1250
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:33,535
A retrospective introspective whatever he says

1251
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:35,071
They're going to cut out anything

1252
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:39,679
It's just a bit

1253
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:42,495
Adam Carolla ranting about

1254
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:44,031
Left turns

1255
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:49,151
You're just doing your doing bad material

1256
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:49,919
Alex

1257
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:51,455
Quartermaster

1258
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:55,551
Also that doesn't answer anything

1259
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:57,343
He answered at the beginning

1260
01:04:58,623 --> 01:04:59,647
But he's lying

1261
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:00,671
Rap God

1262
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:02,719
So she's the main

1263
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:03,487
Conservator

1264
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:12,959
They're doing everything to deny the ruling

1265
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:14,751
Right

1266
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:18,335
Maybe this is maybe this is

1267
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:19,103
Beyond

1268
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:20,895
We haven't

1269
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:23,967
He's acting like this is a loss

1270
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:25,503
No

1271
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:27,551
I really

1272
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:34,207
Where and he's doing everything possible to avoid talking about oh I get it I get what you mean he's acting like it's a loss because

1273
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:40,607
Cuz he's acting like it's not a lot meme

1274
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:43,679
But you probably going to come out and say it's great the trumps global

1275
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:49,055
Is this

1276
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:53,151
No probably not

1277
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:55,967
I think it's a big win

1278
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:56,735
I don't want

1279
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:57,759
Seem like

1280
01:05:59,039 --> 01:05:59,807
Understand

1281
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:00,575
Somebody with MRSA

1282
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:04,159
I don't think you

1283
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:07,487
It doesn't seem like it's from his words

1284
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:11,071
Could be partially like you might be in tonight

1285
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:13,631
If it's possible they really does care but he

1286
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:15,935
Really actually believes that the

1287
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:17,727
The verdict wasn't against

1288
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:21,823
What could possibly justify all this

1289
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:24,383
Based on what we know of him and

1290
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:27,199
The exploration we've done over the last month

1291
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:28,991
I think it's far more likely

1292
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:30,015
That his

1293
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:33,343
Is being really flat about the kids

1294
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:36,927
And him skipping off into Aunt globalist topic

1295
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:39,231
Video

1296
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:42,047
It indicates to me that you're right I don't think he cares

1297
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:48,447
And I was going to save money on that he's going to have a narrative they took my children away

1298
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:50,495
Any has way less responsibility

1299
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:54,591
Maybe

1300
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:56,895
Only now that he can't see him

1301
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:57,919
His kids whenever he wants

1302
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:59,455
Will he actually

1303
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:07,903
Music

1304
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:12,511
Tears in Heaven

1305
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:18,399
Now that he can't see his kids

1306
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:20,703
Now it seems like

1307
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:23,007
Even harder

1308
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:29,151
I think he would fight even harder in the court of public opinion but I don't think he would fight Nightcore

1309
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:31,711
Because again as we discussed earlier

1310
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:36,063
Can't win in court generally only women propaganda

1311
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:42,719
So you will act like he's really trying hard to get it I'm fighting cuz I love my family

1312
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:47,327
That's when in reality is not doing s*** today

1313
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:49,119
God damn it if you don't tell him

1314
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:49,887
No I think

1315
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:56,287
All the way

1316
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:57,823
Can you take a cup

1317
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:03,711
Set precedent a propagandist

1318
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:07,551
Find one more question this block of qna

1319
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:08,831
And this person

1320
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:12,415
How often he will get his kid

1321
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:14,719
Question is very relevant

1322
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:15,999
What's the matter at hand

1323
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:18,559
How often have

1324
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:19,839
Bow Down

1325
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:23,167
Reside with

1326
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:39,295
Is that discharge

1327
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:56,447
Pictures of horse.

1328
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:10,271
Christina the truth

1329
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:16,671
What does it have to do with your kids

1330
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:35,871
As long as

1331
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:48,671
What

1332
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:53,791
Little hanging fruit with 45 million listeners

1333
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:09,151
He's talking about consigning Assange to he said if you got more stuff give it to me

1334
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:23,743
Also you didn't say that he said that you Russia

1335
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:24,767
Donald Trump

1336
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:27,327
Mlife

1337
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:29,631
Russia to provide those emails

1338
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:30,911
Not Julian Assange

1339
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:31,935
Which means

1340
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:33,471
Stupid

1341
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:34,751
It doesn't know

1342
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:35,519
The difference

1343
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:36,287
Or

1344
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:38,335
Because he's friends with Rodger Stone

1345
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:39,615
He does know

1346
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:40,895
The WikiLeaks

1347
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:41,663
Is

1348
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:43,199
Affront

1349
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:46,527
So if one of those two things either you're stupid

1350
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:48,319
Or you have access to information

1351
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:49,343
That we all

1352
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:50,623
Very clearly suspect

1353
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:54,207
You just said he's all but 100%

1354
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:58,047
Slip-on

1355
01:10:58,303 --> 01:11:00,863
But I think you did I think that's possible

1356
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:01,631
That wasn't

1357
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:04,959
Sing Julian Assange instead of Russia

1358
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:05,983
He's talking about Trump

1359
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:10,847
Yeah well he got well I mean all of this

1360
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:12,383
Nonsensical and magical

1361
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:14,687
What is

1362
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:17,247
Is that a slip or what is or is not

1363
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:18,271
Something that he believed

1364
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:21,087
Who knows what nonsense lies in the throats of a man

1365
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:22,879
I don't know

1366
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:23,647
Thank you

1367
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:26,975
Swift

1368
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:29,535
Real poetic as well

1369
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:33,375
Declares himself a libertarian

1370
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:34,399
Good

1371
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:36,703
This goes out

1372
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:37,727
That's not good

1373
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:41,567
You're going to see what he brings up a sort of evidence of his

1374
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:43,359
Libertarian

1375
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:45,919
Right and that would be

1376
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:46,687
His

1377
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:51,295
Nope nope that's not going to do with this

1378
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:54,879
Libertarian

1379
01:11:55,391 --> 01:12:01,535
Human animal chimera

1380
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:07,935
Funeral for body parts

1381
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:14,335
That's wonderful news report

1382
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:20,735
Yep

1383
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:33,535
12.15.9

1384
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:39,935
Funny because people are followers and it makes them feel powerful

1385
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:50,687
Cuz they one way or another

1386
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:51,967
94

1387
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:59,135
Dangerous

1388
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:03,999
He's creating

1389
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:06,559
Allergies are way up

1390
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:14,751
20 years ago they had a rhesus monkey

1391
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:17,823
Glow-in-the-dark

1392
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:25,503
Monkey is medical experiments gets funny

1393
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:28,319
Itsfunneh

1394
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:34,719
It's something good the last

1395
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:36,767
It's fun it is very fun

1396
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:40,095
Dude you got to prove these things

1397
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:41,119
Like

1398
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:42,399
It just doesn't work

1399
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:43,423
To just say

1400
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:44,447
I mean

1401
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:48,799
Spider goats is a real thing

1402
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:49,823
Spider silk

1403
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:56,735
Introduced as well and they have they have

1404
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:57,503
Combined

1405
01:13:57,759 --> 01:13:58,271
Jellyfish

1406
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:00,575
DNA

1407
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:02,879
Glowing or glowing tobacco

1408
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:05,951
Plants that can glow and silver

1409
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:06,975
Pretty interesting

1410
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:07,999
In a lot of ways

1411
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:11,327
When you're trying to bridge that into

1412
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:14,655
Fish people who have terrified human faces

1413
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:15,935
And stuff like that

1414
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:17,215
You got to do your work

1415
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:18,495
You gotta prove it

1416
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:20,543
You can't just have an unnamed

1417
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:22,335
Source

1418
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:26,175
I told you about this it's not that doesn't fly

1419
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:27,711
People make fun of

1420
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:29,503
Cuz this s*** is not real

1421
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:30,527
And your clown

1422
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:33,343
Why are you talkin about

1423
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:38,463
What why are we talkin about chimeras right now cuz he's a libertarian

1424
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:48,447
Libertarian

1425
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:54,335
I didn't cut it like makes that make sense

1426
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:58,943
It's just I'm a Libertarian oh that reminds me I meant

1427
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:01,503
Realized

1428
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:03,551
Take my fish people

1429
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:13,023
I'm starting to realize that I think he probably talks about chimeras way more than I realized

1430
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:18,399
February 1st

1431
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:21,471
He's talked about it three times

1432
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:23,519
So

1433
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:24,543
Concerned

1434
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:27,871
Well there is one actually Internet America

1435
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:31,967
No but there's one interesting thing I kind of

1436
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:33,247
Think I mean

1437
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:36,063
I don't I don't believe that what he's saying is happening

1438
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:37,599
But if it were happening

1439
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:39,135
One thing that is like

1440
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:41,439
What he brings up is the idea of

1441
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:43,487
Different diseases being in

1442
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:45,023
Introduced through that like

1443
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:46,303
We could get like

1444
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:48,095
Animal diseases

1445
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:49,887
That we could then become susceptible to

1446
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:50,911
Or we could just

1447
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:52,703
Create diseases

1448
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:53,983
I'm not even sure if that's

1449
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:54,751
Possible

1450
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:56,031
But be that as it may

1451
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:57,055
The idea that

1452
01:15:58,335 --> 01:15:59,615
Supper some medical

1453
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:01,151
Lost because of it

1454
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:02,175
Alright

1455
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:03,455
I'm listening to that

1456
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:05,759
You got to prove that it's going on first

1457
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:06,783
Yeah but

1458
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:10,623
You know that seems like an endlessly complicated

1459
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:11,391
Smallpox

1460
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:14,207
That's a fair point

1461
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:16,511
We need to get Chimera so we can get disease

1462
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:22,911
Accidentally

1463
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:23,679
Like

1464
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:30,079
Mansion play God diseases that he's talking about

1465
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:30,847
Diseases

1466
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:34,431
You're right there's way more things

1467
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:35,711
Worry about

1468
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:38,783
Chimeras

1469
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:39,807
Which

1470
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:41,087
Debbie

1471
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:43,903
Kind of cool I'm all in on science

1472
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:47,743
What's what's the f

1473
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:48,511
Vixen clothing

1474
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:54,911
F*** it let's calm s*** I don't know we'll find out later I don't know you can't really know us something really wrong until YouTube

1475
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:57,983
I know we shouldn't test

1476
01:16:58,239 --> 01:16:59,263
Cosmetics on animal

1477
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:00,031
Sure

1478
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:00,799
Cuz that's a bummer

1479
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:03,103
Very much so

1480
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:09,247
I've never seen the human-animal hybrid before

1481
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:10,527
How do I know it's bad

1482
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:14,111
Documentaries

1483
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:16,159
Why not

1484
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:22,559
You know what here's the thing you were going off on that I started to realize what it is that makes Alex Jones very off

1485
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:23,327
Waffle in court

1486
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:25,887
And it's because there's a burden of proof

1487
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:26,911
He can't

1488
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:27,679
Proofing

1489
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:31,263
Service fish people with terrifying

1490
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:34,079
If you were to try and make that claim in court he can't prove it

1491
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:36,127
So

1492
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:37,151
He's f*****

1493
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:39,199
On the street it doesn't need approval

1494
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:39,967
He just needs to

1495
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:40,735
To assert thing

1496
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:42,015
I hate him

1497
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:44,063
Anyway

1498
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:46,623
In this next

1499
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:47,391
Flip

1500
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:55,839
I cut that part out cuz it's just them Milling around and it goes on for like 2

1501
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:57,887
It's just just some dude

1502
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:00,959
Some like bailiff

1503
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:07,103
Not even

1504
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:13,247
We just need to have room so people can get through that salt

1505
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:16,319
And so they they Shuffle about and then Alex

1506
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:22,975
Alex gets his lawyer to come over and see if you were

1507
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:24,767
Which is about advise

1508
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:31,935
Randall will. My great lawyers named family love up here in Texas is never seen try like this is 30 something year

1509
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:38,591
State of the Union

1510
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:39,615
The family Union

1511
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:43,199
I want to give a little bit of a warning

1512
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:44,735
Randall Wilhite

1513
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:45,759
Uncle Mike's

1514
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:47,807
This is very low

1515
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:14,431
Absolutely

1516
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:19,551
So it so what I thought I heard him give

1517
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:22,367
A boilerplate lawyer

1518
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:30,047
Call Keepin On

1519
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:31,583
Very general broad results

1520
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:32,607
The Galaxy Center

1521
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:33,375
Already

1522
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:34,911
Yeah and that it was

1523
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:35,935
And that was that

1524
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:38,495
Flipped out of the back of his head

1525
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:40,031
F****** much already

1526
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:44,639
Then goes on to say a little bit more

1527
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:46,175
And I think

1528
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:50,783
I think this is one of the first indications that this dude might not be a very great lawyer

1529
01:19:53,343 --> 01:19:59,487
The only state in the United States

1530
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:03,583
Did you catch that

1531
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:06,655
Visit the Texas is the only state

1532
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:07,935
As far as I know

1533
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:09,215
You should know

1534
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:10,495
Seems pretty

1535
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:15,104
Specialty is family law

1536
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:16,896
But who cares

1537
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:18,688
You should know

1538
01:20:19,712 --> 01:20:24,320
State of the Union

1539
01:20:24,576 --> 01:20:26,880
Because he is

1540
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:28,928
I mean

1541
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:32,512
For you

1542
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:38,656
Don't put my business on the street Alex I just lost your f****** case

1543
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:40,192
Shipt

1544
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:42,752
Still charging you by the word

1545
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:45,568
It is by the word

1546
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:49,664
You and I

1547
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:51,968
Control again

1548
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:55,040
And one of the people asked how his kids doing

1549
01:20:57,344 --> 01:20:57,856
The great question

1550
01:20:58,112 --> 01:21:02,464
Theoretically well we're living in this world

1551
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:05,280
This is not going to go great actually even answer

1552
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:07,840
Or if he's going to end up talking about

1553
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:10,656
The destruction of the United States

1554
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:16,800
Or you didn't do that that

1555
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:19,616
There was so much going on in the trial where

1556
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:27,040
There's a lot of stuff where there wasn't

1557
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:29,856
Play the net

1558
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:34,976
That's what happens when your

1559
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:47,008
Yes we all remember when John Quincy Adams that is

1560
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:51,104
Kids taken away around the founding of the United States

1561
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:54,176
That's what happened

1562
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:55,968
Detective

1563
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:03,904
Yeah you know that's why they call them

1564
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:05,184
The founding

1565
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:06,720
Alienated fathers

1566
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:10,304
Exactly the sounding fathers who have

1567
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:14,656
Poop like a

1568
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:18,240
So like

1569
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:22,848
That that's what happens when you try and be cool

1570
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:24,128
Right

1571
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:25,664
Not at all

1572
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:26,432
Llorona

1573
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:27,712
To blame for this

1574
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:33,088
North Korea Venezuela

1575
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:36,416
Control orders

1576
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:52,544
Competition

1577
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:05,344
Are there prayers to come over here and

1578
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:24,032
What is what you say he throws away the toys and he does this

1579
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:35,552
Chaos

1580
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:39,392
Call Joseph

1581
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:41,952
Mainstream media so discredited

1582
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:45,792
That the more that is degree

1583
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:48,864
But in little

1584
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:55,520
You don't desiderio the followers like you're in Austin Texas pretty clear that the

1585
01:23:55,776 --> 01:24:01,920
Iago government loving corporate worship system

1586
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:08,320
Herbal system still has still has tentacles go growing and doing well and so

1587
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:21,120
We're just here for your listeners

1588
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:33,920
Great

1589
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:36,992
Tonight the kids on the weekend

1590
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:41,600
I look forward to hearing how you distort this

1591
01:24:41,856 --> 01:24:44,416
For like the thing is so f***** up is it

1592
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:45,184
Possibly do

1593
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:47,488
I don't know play it

1594
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:48,768
In context

1595
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:51,584
Scotto's

1596
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:54,400
Distort that's why I love that

1597
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:59,520
Key piece that came out that was just the unedited transcript of the interview with Trump

1598
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:02,592
Cuz it's like it's so much worse than article

1599
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:07,200
What else is there to say

1600
01:25:07,456 --> 01:25:09,760
Frustrating since 9/11

1601
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:12,064
With

1602
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:14,880
Clearly degenerative mental illness

1603
01:25:15,136 --> 01:25:18,208
So I also this thing is super awesome

1604
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:19,488
Does Alex

1605
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:21,536
As we go along we just friends

1606
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:22,816
These behaviors that he does

1607
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:26,400
Adolescent behavior is the

1608
01:25:26,656 --> 01:25:27,424
When he's like

1609
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:34,080
Surprised

1610
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:36,640
It's the exact same thing he did when he was like

1611
01:25:36,896 --> 01:25:38,176
What's a Chobani

1612
01:25:38,432 --> 01:25:42,272
All right Muslims have never heard anybody ever have never shot anybody

1613
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:43,808
It's all you're doing is

1614
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:46,368
You know that the argument against you is bad

1615
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:47,392
And you can't

1616
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:48,928
Engage with it so you just

1617
01:25:49,184 --> 01:25:49,696
Trying

1618
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:50,720
Overblown

1619
01:25:50,976 --> 01:25:51,488
Pretend

1620
01:25:51,744 --> 01:25:52,768
Like that's what the first

1621
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:53,792
Actually is

1622
01:25:55,328 --> 01:25:55,840
And your

1623
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:56,864
In trouble

1624
01:25:57,376 --> 01:25:57,888
Very much true

1625
01:25:58,912 --> 01:25:59,424
Trouble

1626
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:01,984
So

1627
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:03,264
That guy walking by

1628
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:09,664
Wednesday

1629
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:10,432
Some s***

1630
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:15,296
And

1631
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:17,856
We're going to

1632
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:20,416
Have the introduction of a new character

1633
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:23,744
Rainbow

1634
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:24,512
No

1635
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:26,560
This is not an intentional character

1636
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:27,328
Okay

1637
01:26:27,584 --> 01:26:29,888
Here is here's my pitch

1638
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:31,168
Alex

1639
01:26:33,472 --> 01:26:34,752
Has rainbow snatch

1640
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:36,544
Or whatever face Millie Weaver

1641
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:39,872
His daughter and

1642
01:26:41,152 --> 01:26:43,968
That's not I think you would be into that

1643
01:26:44,224 --> 01:26:46,528
Stickman situation

1644
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:48,064
So

1645
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:49,600
No that's not the character

1646
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:54,208
I'll f***

1647
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:00,864
It to the press conference

1648
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:01,632
Yep

1649
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:04,704
You suck

1650
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:07,520
Become Alex Jones

1651
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:16,480
Keeping control of the situation

1652
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:20,064
So crazy

1653
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,392
I want to pull up this cuz he they

1654
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:27,744
The only coverage on infowars.com of this whole thing

1655
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:29,024
Was

1656
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:30,816
An article about this homeless

1657
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:35,424
But it's like an in-depth article or anything like that

1658
01:27:36,192 --> 01:27:36,960
I got to pull it up here

1659
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:38,240
I want a quote it

1660
01:27:39,008 --> 01:27:39,520
Appropriate

1661
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:41,824
All right so the headline is

1662
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:45,408
Trolls media attacking Alex Jones

1663
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:48,992
That is their takeoff

1664
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:52,320
As if the homeless man is like

1665
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:54,368
Look you can see that

1666
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:55,136
That's the guy

1667
01:27:55,392 --> 01:27:56,160
You shirtless

1668
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:59,488
The PSV probably

1669
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:00,768
A rough life

1670
01:28:01,024 --> 01:28:01,792
I would assume

1671
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:03,840
It's a very

1672
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:14,592
I got to step up for my man Alex

1673
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:16,896
People listen to Listen to Infowars

1674
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:22,272
That's just a true fact the only connection on have that I think

1675
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:23,552
You probably believe there

1676
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:26,624
That's my only that's the only connection

1677
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:31,488
If he gets them

1678
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:33,280
So that doesn't really

1679
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:38,400
I'm not sure but I wanted to introduce him

1680
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:41,472
Is a force

1681
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:42,752
In the end

1682
01:28:43,008 --> 01:28:43,520
The story

1683
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:47,360
Just about like a really

1684
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:49,152
Etsy just abusing

1685
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:51,200
Tell him.

1686
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:04,512
All perception

1687
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:05,536
Jurisdiction

1688
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:18,080
Play play semantical

1689
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:33,440
Call Mike

1690
01:29:37,024 --> 01:29:37,792
Whizzer on again

1691
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:39,328
That's exactly what you're doing

1692
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:41,888
But also

1693
01:29:42,656 --> 01:29:44,192
Atrocious because he's made this

1694
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:45,984
Exact statement

1695
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:47,520
30 million

1696
01:29:48,032 --> 01:29:48,544
It's

1697
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:52,384
40 *

1698
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:55,712
I know you said we weren't going to talk about it anymore but I left it in here Forest

1699
01:29:55,968 --> 01:29:58,784
Specific reason

1700
01:29:59,040 --> 01:29:59,808
But he doesn't want to go.

1701
01:30:00,576 --> 01:30:02,368
MD reporters start actually

1702
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:03,136
Questions

1703
01:30:03,392 --> 01:30:04,416
Falls apart

1704
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:08,000
Him introducing this idea of a

1705
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:10,560
Play characters blah blah blah

1706
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:12,608
That thing is actually important

1707
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:30,784
Night for the laugh everybody Federal White

1708
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:37,184
The fiction you guys come up with how you quit this is the second

1709
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:04,064
Sugar Steel the image of rooster and goes upside down so

1710
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:10,464
Will continue being serious issues

1711
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:23,776
There you you hear a female voice there right

1712
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:26,080
Leads to this

1713
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:27,360
Next question

1714
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:30,432
But it is important to point out that

1715
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:32,992
People

1716
01:31:33,248 --> 01:31:39,136
I have being awful and you know you don't realize that the only reason you hate us is because we're Trailblazer at

1717
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:40,928
Anxiety

1718
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:41,952
Sleep

1719
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:44,768
Dum Dum Dums

1720
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:46,048
I have an interview

1721
01:31:46,304 --> 01:31:49,888
We're making history.

1722
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:52,704
Speaks to the

1723
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:56,032
It's not fully clear what the lady is asking

1724
01:31:56,288 --> 01:31:56,800
When is

1725
01:31:57,056 --> 01:31:58,848
This is a serious situation like

1726
01:32:01,152 --> 01:32:03,200
Why are you using satire

1727
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:04,992
When things are so serious

1728
01:32:05,504 --> 01:32:06,016
Basically

1729
01:32:34,432 --> 01:32:37,248
No one wrote that headline about who

1730
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:39,296
Whenever you started putting

1731
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:40,832
Goldman Sachs

1732
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:41,600
People in

1733
01:32:42,112 --> 01:32:44,416
He was Betty tried to make the argument that like

1734
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:46,464
He needs Goblin guides

1735
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:51,584
Right you know he's like if he's going to get through the goblin territory

1736
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:52,352
Use

1737
01:32:52,864 --> 01:32:53,376
Local

1738
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:56,704
As it were

1739
01:32:58,496 --> 01:33:00,288
What is metaphor

1740
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:02,080
I have no one wrote an article that

1741
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:06,432
Thought they were literal Goblin

1742
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:12,320
That stroller

1743
01:33:13,856 --> 01:33:18,976
Doing is not parole

1744
01:33:19,488 --> 01:33:21,792
Stoic

1745
01:33:26,144 --> 01:33:29,984
Gyros

1746
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:35,104
This is the man who will see where this goes

1747
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:03,520
Lose

1748
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:05,056
There's another person

1749
01:34:05,312 --> 01:34:05,824
In the crowd

1750
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:09,920
But isn't this is fully off the rails

1751
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:12,736
If you're watching the video of the homeless guy is

1752
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:15,296
Alex has her like

1753
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:17,600
But this is kind of stupid

1754
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:20,160
Yeah they can

1755
01:34:21,184 --> 01:34:22,464
Course

1756
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:23,232
Because you

1757
01:34:28,096 --> 01:34:30,656
Is not appropriate at least it's a dumb question

1758
01:34:32,704 --> 01:34:35,008
Better formed a better form version the question is

1759
01:34:35,264 --> 01:34:37,056
You're really bad at satire

1760
01:34:37,312 --> 01:34:39,872
So why are you doing

1761
01:34:40,128 --> 01:34:40,896
If that's not a question

1762
01:34:41,152 --> 01:34:43,712
What is foundational

1763
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:45,504
You're really bad it's at

1764
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:51,904
If you're still fat such a serious situation you're going to

1765
01:34:54,464 --> 01:34:57,280
Would be better for version of the question

1766
01:34:57,536 --> 01:34:58,048
But

1767
01:34:58,304 --> 01:34:59,584
Again it is important

1768
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:00,608
Because what it leads to

1769
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:02,912
Homeless guy

1770
01:35:03,424 --> 01:35:04,192
Dylan play

1771
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:17,760
Dress up like

1772
01:35:41,568 --> 01:35:43,616
Yeah this is not my favorite thing

1773
01:35:43,872 --> 01:35:45,920
It's worth it just like it took like

1774
01:35:46,176 --> 01:35:52,320
Half an hour of the press conference to get to this but now we're here at thank God

1775
01:35:52,576 --> 01:35:54,624
Every time you heard

1776
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:55,648
That

1777
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:58,976
The other day

1778
01:35:59,232 --> 01:36:01,536
That's the homeless man

1779
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:05,376
I'm sorry the train or not

1780
01:36:05,888 --> 01:36:06,912
Butts

1781
01:36:07,168 --> 01:36:08,704
Detritus and the press conference

1782
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:09,984
Again there

1783
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:13,312
And here is why the question was important

1784
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:15,616
Because there's a follow-up this person

1785
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:18,688
Asking specific things

1786
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:23,296
This satire

1787
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:26,624
Nope

1788
01:36:27,904 --> 01:36:29,184
Peter answer is good

1789
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:34,304
So the first one

1790
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:35,840
At all

1791
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:36,864
Just left

1792
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:41,472
The first one is regarding

1793
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:45,568
Alex Jones is Obama's children might not be

1794
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:47,616
That sort of thing

1795
01:36:55,808 --> 01:37:00,928
Imaginarium

1796
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:02,720
Qdoba

1797
01:37:05,024 --> 01:37:06,560
Who is the lady that was Joan Rivers

1798
01:37:06,816 --> 01:37:08,352
Rivers jokes

1799
01:37:11,936 --> 01:37:15,776
Medical

1800
01:37:16,032 --> 01:37:18,848
Experience she was going through

1801
01:37:19,104 --> 01:37:22,688
Then I should look Joan Rivers said she's a tranny

1802
01:37:22,944 --> 01:37:24,480
The meaning of Inception

1803
01:37:24,736 --> 01:37:26,528
Obama was

1804
01:37:28,064 --> 01:37:33,184
It was clearly a joke

1805
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:45,984
What happened

1806
01:38:04,672 --> 01:38:06,464
Don't use that language Alex that's

1807
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:08,768
Stupid and bigoted

1808
01:38:12,864 --> 01:38:13,376
He's lying

1809
01:38:13,632 --> 01:38:14,656
A hundred percent

1810
01:38:14,912 --> 01:38:16,448
It's very easy to find clips

1811
01:38:16,704 --> 01:38:17,728
Of him reporting

1812
01:38:17,984 --> 01:38:19,520
On Michelle Obama being a

1813
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:20,544
Secretly a man

1814
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:24,128
We've got over

1815
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:26,432
Astro

1816
01:38:26,688 --> 01:38:27,712
Michael Obama

1817
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:28,736
Sometimes

1818
01:38:28,992 --> 01:38:32,576
And I mean if you wants to say it's joking fine but that means that the way he

1819
01:38:32,832 --> 01:38:33,856
Joke

1820
01:38:34,112 --> 01:38:35,648
Serious sounding news reports

1821
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,696
And if that's his argument

1822
01:38:37,952 --> 01:38:38,976
That's worse

1823
01:38:39,232 --> 01:38:40,768
Let him just being like we got that one

1824
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:42,560
It's way worse

1825
01:38:43,072 --> 01:38:43,584
Yak

1826
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:44,864
Is that opens up

1827
01:38:45,376 --> 01:38:46,912
Literally everything he's ever said

1828
01:38:47,424 --> 01:38:48,960
If you watch the coverage of

1829
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:50,240
The

1830
01:38:50,496 --> 01:38:52,032
God now all I want

1831
01:38:55,616 --> 01:38:56,640
Next

1832
01:38:56,896 --> 01:38:58,944
During every Infowars

1833
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:03,552
Infowars

1834
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:04,832
Infowars

1835
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:08,160
The derby

1836
01:39:08,672 --> 01:39:09,440
That would be amazing

1837
01:39:09,696 --> 01:39:15,840
If you guys want to hear a full breakdown of that eclipse and everything is on our February 24th

1838
01:39:16,352 --> 01:39:16,864
Episode

1839
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:18,144
2017

1840
01:39:18,656 --> 01:39:21,984
We played

1841
01:39:22,496 --> 01:39:24,032
About Michelle Obama

1842
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:25,824
You're busted

1843
01:39:27,104 --> 01:39:27,616
Pretty wack

1844
01:39:29,408 --> 01:39:29,920
Somebody's at the door

1845
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:34,528
I got it

1846
01:39:38,368 --> 01:39:39,648
Oh no

1847
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:41,440
I like to add a little more depth

1848
01:39:45,024 --> 01:39:48,096
Also at the end of that last clip there was another voice

1849
01:39:49,632 --> 01:39:50,144
That was like

1850
01:39:50,656 --> 01:39:53,472
Was Sandy Hook satire

1851
01:39:53,728 --> 01:39:54,752
Somatic

1852
01:39:55,008 --> 01:39:55,520
Another question

1853
01:39:55,776 --> 01:39:59,104
Is going to lie about what

1854
01:40:00,896 --> 01:40:07,040
That's a joke

1855
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:33,920
On the air

1856
01:40:35,968 --> 01:40:38,784
I know you were talking about

1857
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:43,904
November

1858
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:50,304
No I don't know I clarify.

1859
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:56,704
Something totally accurate

1860
01:40:56,960 --> 01:41:03,104
Create that story clarify

1861
01:41:13,344 --> 01:41:16,416
You lying Alex you lying about

1862
01:41:16,672 --> 01:41:18,208
You were not playing Devil's Advocate

1863
01:41:18,464 --> 01:41:20,768
You literally said there were no children killed

1864
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:24,096
Synthetic event

1865
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:33,056
Swiss cheese right there

1866
01:41:33,312 --> 01:41:36,128
I never even lying further about what you did in the

1867
01:41:36,384 --> 01:41:37,152
Every situation with

1868
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:38,432
I mean

1869
01:41:38,688 --> 01:41:40,224
You lie and say that you didn't

1870
01:41:40,992 --> 01:41:42,016
Claimed that there was

1871
01:41:42,528 --> 01:41:43,808
Abuse going on at Thomas

1872
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:44,576
Pinkfong witch

1873
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:45,600
Sarah videos

1874
01:41:45,856 --> 01:41:48,160
Deleted from the internet but people still have

1875
01:41:48,416 --> 01:41:48,928
Betternet

1876
01:41:49,696 --> 01:41:50,976
Turn those really hard

1877
01:41:51,232 --> 01:41:54,560
Lying about what your apology

1878
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:56,864
She was your cowardice trying to dajjal

1879
01:41:58,656 --> 01:42:00,960
F*** you

1880
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:04,288
Very very sad

1881
01:42:05,568 --> 01:42:09,152
Wandering Inn

1882
01:42:09,408 --> 01:42:12,736
The Masters bummer if you didn't

1883
01:42:13,504 --> 01:42:15,552
He was a decent person

1884
01:42:16,064 --> 01:42:16,576
Horrifying

1885
01:42:18,112 --> 01:42:19,136
Like this is just really

1886
01:42:19,392 --> 01:42:20,672
This is just him

1887
01:42:20,928 --> 01:42:22,720
Struggling so hard to get out of

1888
01:42:22,976 --> 01:42:23,488
All of these

1889
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:24,512
Traps that

1890
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:25,536
He's locked himself

1891
01:42:26,304 --> 01:42:27,328
Yeah

1892
01:42:27,584 --> 01:42:28,096
He's just

1893
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:32,192
The word for today

1894
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:36,288
Some of it other than other than wind Chobani really murders

1895
01:42:38,848 --> 01:42:39,872
Chobani can get like what

1896
01:42:40,128 --> 01:42:41,920
10 million dollars from or something like that

1897
01:42:42,432 --> 01:42:43,200
Call Guy want them

1898
01:42:44,736 --> 01:42:46,016
I don't know what side of the situation

1899
01:42:46,272 --> 01:42:51,136
He's not done anything that specifically like

1900
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:52,160
A felony

1901
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:55,488
Call spell matters

1902
01:42:55,744 --> 01:42:56,256
Everybody's

1903
01:42:56,512 --> 01:42:59,328
Well even though you use you saw it on the storm front

1904
01:43:00,096 --> 01:43:01,888
People are already trying to make up

1905
01:43:02,144 --> 01:43:03,168
Reasons that now he can

1906
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:04,704
Get away with all kind

1907
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:05,472
Signs of others

1908
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:08,032
Pooping off of his

1909
01:43:08,288 --> 01:43:12,128
Because of the incredibly fun intersection of like anti-semitism

1910
01:43:12,384 --> 01:43:12,896
Misogyny

1911
01:43:13,152 --> 01:43:14,944
Yes culture

1912
01:43:15,712 --> 01:43:21,088
I mean power due to

1913
01:43:21,344 --> 01:43:22,624
Find hubs on the internet

1914
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:24,160
All roads lead to Rome

1915
01:43:24,416 --> 01:43:25,184
Miss Kay's on Fortune

1916
01:43:27,488 --> 01:43:29,024
Zen Massage

1917
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:32,608
Cool I love it

1918
01:43:35,424 --> 01:43:36,704
What you're saying is exactly right

1919
01:43:37,216 --> 01:43:41,056
The people on that Stormfront website

1920
01:43:41,568 --> 01:43:42,592
Another like biggest

1921
01:43:42,848 --> 01:43:43,616
Message board

1922
01:43:43,872 --> 01:43:45,408
Does having the exact same conversation

1923
01:43:46,176 --> 01:43:46,944
Edit

1924
01:43:47,456 --> 01:43:49,504
It is if they're making excuses for him like

1925
01:43:50,272 --> 01:43:51,808
Their problem is

1926
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:53,856
He's not calling out Israel

1927
01:43:54,368 --> 01:43:55,904
Yeah

1928
01:43:57,440 --> 01:43:57,952
Light

1929
01:43:58,208 --> 01:44:01,024
Right but instead of making that his fault

1930
01:44:01,536 --> 01:44:02,816
They make it his ex-wife

1931
01:44:03,072 --> 01:44:03,584
Asphalt

1932
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:04,608
Because she's Jewish

1933
01:44:05,376 --> 01:44:05,888
It's insane

1934
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:07,936
It's insane

1935
01:44:08,192 --> 01:44:08,704
You have to go through

1936
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:09,984
You're contortionist

1937
01:44:10,496 --> 01:44:11,008
Intellectually

1938
01:44:11,264 --> 01:44:11,776
But that

1939
01:44:12,288 --> 01:44:12,800
That's

1940
01:44:13,056 --> 01:44:16,384
It's like this is such a real bummer mainly because

1941
01:44:17,408 --> 01:44:18,688
If there is there was going to

1942
01:44:19,968 --> 01:44:20,480
Possibility that you

1943
01:44:21,504 --> 01:44:22,272
All of the

1944
01:44:22,528 --> 01:44:23,296
All of the right-wing

1945
01:44:25,088 --> 01:44:26,368
Like all of the Fox News

1946
01:44:27,648 --> 01:44:28,672
If there was any chance

1947
01:44:28,928 --> 01:44:29,440
Mr. reach them

1948
01:44:29,696 --> 01:44:30,976
Then you would see like that

1949
01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:32,000
Beginnings of it here

1950
01:44:32,512 --> 01:44:34,560
People would finally go like

1951
01:44:35,584 --> 01:44:38,144
I'm going to stop list

1952
01:44:38,656 --> 01:44:39,680
Or I'm going to

1953
01:44:45,824 --> 01:44:46,336
Nobody

1954
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:48,128
Nobody who loves Bill O'Reilly

1955
01:44:48,384 --> 01:44:49,152
Is changing their mind

1956
01:44:50,176 --> 01:44:51,456
It's like this is something that you

1957
01:44:51,712 --> 01:44:53,504
You have to be able to do if you

1958
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:57,856
Of this world

1959
01:44:58,112 --> 01:45:00,928
Falling apart look at it from their perspective

1960
01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:04,000
O'Reilly and he's obviously

1961
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:04,768
Obviously

1962
01:45:06,304 --> 01:45:07,840
And his argument

1963
01:45:08,352 --> 01:45:09,888
The truth is going to come out and it'll shock you

1964
01:45:10,656 --> 01:45:11,936
Yeah

1965
01:45:12,448 --> 01:45:14,496
But he

1966
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:19,104
He's being lied about an event

1967
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:23,712
Now we can Flash Forward a few years and no truth that is like

1968
01:45:27,552 --> 01:45:29,088
Because that argument is enough

1969
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:31,392
In the same way that Alex is here being like

1970
01:45:31,648 --> 01:45:36,000
Lock the Chargers got a rule on stuff in the specifics might be like a month or whatever

1971
01:45:36,256 --> 01:45:41,120
Brett

1972
01:45:41,632 --> 01:45:45,984
Flash-forward a month people will be talking about the chobani's or whatever the next thing is

1973
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:47,264
His narrative

1974
01:45:48,544 --> 01:45:53,152
It'll never have to deal with like no one will even remember that he lied to them about that

1975
01:45:54,176 --> 01:45:55,712
F****** very frustrating

1976
01:45:56,224 --> 01:45:56,992
Very frustrating

1977
01:45:57,504 --> 01:45:59,040
But I guess we did choose to do this

1978
01:45:59,296 --> 01:46:01,088
Set Sonos

1979
01:46:01,344 --> 01:46:01,856
Yeah yeah

1980
01:46:02,368 --> 01:46:04,672
We we fall into our trap of Our Own

1981
01:46:05,184 --> 01:46:05,696
A grade

1982
01:46:05,952 --> 01:46:07,744
We proved ourselves

1983
01:46:08,256 --> 01:46:08,768
I just

1984
01:46:09,024 --> 01:46:09,536
1

1985
01:46:09,792 --> 01:46:10,560
Small subset

1986
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:12,608
Wait

1987
01:46:13,888 --> 01:46:14,400
He is

1988
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:18,240
Volumental

1989
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:19,008
It really does

1990
01:46:19,264 --> 01:46:21,824
Because if you've been a fan of Alex Jones for

1991
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:23,872
15 years

1992
01:46:24,384 --> 01:46:25,920
All the sudden you finally have

1993
01:46:26,176 --> 01:46:26,944
Have to come to that

1994
01:46:27,456 --> 01:46:28,224
Spot where you go

1995
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:30,272
I have been lied to by this

1996
01:46:30,528 --> 01:46:31,040
This map

1997
01:46:31,296 --> 01:46:32,064
What else

1998
01:46:32,832 --> 01:46:33,856
Was he not telling me

1999
01:46:34,112 --> 01:46:34,624
The truth about

2000
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:35,648
Spoiler alert

2001
01:46:35,904 --> 01:46:36,928
Everything

2002
01:46:37,184 --> 01:46:38,720
Like the moment you get there

2003
01:46:41,024 --> 01:46:42,304
The moment that happened

2004
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:43,072
It tips

2005
01:46:43,328 --> 01:46:44,096
One way or the other

2006
01:46:44,352 --> 01:46:47,424
Well

2007
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:49,728
We're going down like a

2008
01:46:49,984 --> 01:46:53,056
Interesting long-ass here but the reason the most

2009
01:46:53,568 --> 01:46:54,080
Can't do that

2010
01:46:54,336 --> 01:46:54,848
Especially

2011
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:57,664
Do you found Alex Jones when you are

2012
01:46:57,920 --> 01:46:58,432
Young

2013
01:46:58,688 --> 01:46:59,200
Where you were

2014
01:46:59,456 --> 01:47:00,480
An angry impression

2015
01:47:00,736 --> 01:47:02,528
Cannibal obviously white person

2016
01:47:03,296 --> 01:47:04,576
White male

2017
01:47:04,832 --> 01:47:06,368
YouTube

2018
01:47:07,136 --> 01:47:09,952
There's a lot of things that he says help you

2019
01:47:10,464 --> 01:47:12,512
Make sense of the world and why you're not as

2020
01:47:12,768 --> 01:47:13,536
Successful if you want

2021
01:47:14,304 --> 01:47:16,608
And there is a utility to the wise

2022
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:19,424
4 people

2023
01:47:19,936 --> 01:47:21,216
Understanding the world in

2024
01:47:21,472 --> 01:47:21,984
In the confusion

2025
01:47:23,776 --> 01:47:25,056
We talked about this all the time

2026
01:47:25,312 --> 01:47:26,592
Off mic

2027
01:47:26,848 --> 01:47:29,664
Barbie ideas like people having to make sense of randomness

2028
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:31,456
Yeah you come up with whatever

2029
01:47:31,712 --> 01:47:32,224
Explanation

2030
01:47:33,248 --> 01:47:33,760
You come up with

2031
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:37,088
The random chance of life

2032
01:47:37,344 --> 01:47:37,856
No it's

2033
01:47:38,112 --> 01:47:40,416
Obviously

2034
01:47:40,672 --> 01:47:41,184
Does it work

2035
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:42,208
EXO

2036
01:47:42,464 --> 01:47:43,744
Once you have that

2037
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:45,024
Mind virus

2038
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:46,048
In your brain

2039
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:47,328
Getting rid of it

2040
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:48,352
Create

2041
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:52,192
Vacuum creates a gap where now the world doesn't make

2042
01:47:53,216 --> 01:47:54,496
And that's really scary for me

2043
01:47:55,008 --> 01:47:58,848
So I think a lot of time even though the crutch

2044
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:00,128
Is actually hurting

2045
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:05,760
So there was this guy back in Columbia Missouri

2046
01:48:06,016 --> 01:48:08,064
Come into the liquor store my brother worked at all the time

2047
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:10,112
Is it the younger guy

2048
01:48:10,368 --> 01:48:11,392
If you like 40 or so

2049
01:48:11,648 --> 01:48:12,928
And he always in a wheelchair

2050
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:17,536
The story came to learn over the course of time

2051
01:48:17,792 --> 01:48:19,072
Was that cute kind of

2052
01:48:19,584 --> 01:48:22,656
As I recall he was a scam artist kind of trying to get disability stuff

2053
01:48:22,912 --> 01:48:23,936
James O'Keefe

2054
01:48:24,192 --> 01:48:27,008
He was going around in a wheelchair

2055
01:48:27,264 --> 01:48:29,568
For really long time

2056
01:48:30,336 --> 01:48:36,480
Because he stayed

2057
01:48:36,736 --> 01:48:37,248
His muscles actor

2058
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:43,392
It got to the point where he needed to be in the wheelchair

2059
01:48:43,648 --> 01:48:48,768
Exactly and so he wasn't himself into a wheelchair by scamming a wheelchair

2060
01:48:50,304 --> 01:48:53,632
So Alex Jones listeners intellectual wheelchair

2061
01:48:53,888 --> 01:48:55,424
You don't need to be in a wheelchair

2062
01:48:55,680 --> 01:49:00,288
So they think it's easier to go through life with that wheelchair rolling around then it is to walk

2063
01:49:00,544 --> 01:49:01,312
Right

2064
01:49:01,568 --> 01:49:04,896
Realize you do this too long you won't be able to get out of it

2065
01:49:05,408 --> 01:49:06,176
You won't you just

2066
01:49:06,432 --> 01:49:09,760
You'll never give up that wheelchair metaphorically

2067
01:49:10,016 --> 01:49:11,296
You'll stay in it

2068
01:49:11,552 --> 01:49:13,600
Great f****** metaphor thank you

2069
01:49:13,856 --> 01:49:18,976
You just crossed it out within the context

2070
01:49:19,232 --> 01:49:21,536
That should give a press conference

2071
01:49:22,816 --> 01:49:26,400
Anyway

2072
01:49:26,656 --> 01:49:29,984
I mean you know you stand up for long enough and you

2073
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:35,872
Microphones for a long time and kind of used to putting connections together also if you're not a f****** idiot

2074
01:49:36,128 --> 01:49:38,176
About you but

2075
01:49:38,432 --> 01:49:38,944
Alex

2076
01:49:40,736 --> 01:49:41,760
Fish-people Jones

2077
01:49:42,784 --> 01:49:43,296
Alex Jones

2078
01:49:45,088 --> 01:49:50,976
Two more Clips laugh

2079
01:49:52,256 --> 01:49:55,584
Unless

2080
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:56,864
The camera kept rolling

2081
01:49:57,120 --> 01:49:59,936
Excellent

2082
01:50:00,192 --> 01:50:01,728
I need to William F Buckley

2083
01:50:01,984 --> 01:50:05,568
I need to do some research into this is I understand

2084
01:50:05,824 --> 01:50:06,336
It's Alex Jones

2085
01:50:06,592 --> 01:50:07,360
The Stepbrother

2086
01:50:07,872 --> 01:50:08,640
Or something like that

2087
01:50:09,152 --> 01:50:11,200
Brother-in-law

2088
01:50:13,248 --> 01:50:17,088
He's a guy who's like a behind-the-scenes bigwig at Infowars

2089
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:18,880
Okay the cameraman

2090
01:50:19,136 --> 01:50:20,672
The two of them go into the courthouse

2091
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:22,208
And I can

2092
01:50:22,464 --> 01:50:23,232
Confirmed now

2093
01:50:23,488 --> 01:50:25,024
That the room with all the books

2094
01:50:25,536 --> 01:50:28,864
Is inside the courthouse

2095
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:31,424
Allowed him to

2096
01:50:31,936 --> 01:50:32,448
I don't know

2097
01:50:33,472 --> 01:50:38,848
Cuz they're doing it on an iPhone on OneDrive book not but

2098
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:39,872
I mean

2099
01:50:40,128 --> 01:50:41,664
I saw the answer is they did not ask

2100
01:50:42,944 --> 01:50:45,504
Cuz if they had asked I would almost guarantee they're like

2101
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:46,784
No

2102
01:50:47,296 --> 01:50:49,600

Is Alex

2107
01:51:00,608 --> 01:51:03,168
The jury's decision

2108
01:51:03,936 --> 01:51:04,448
And kind of

2109
01:51:04,704 --> 01:51:05,984
Body being really murky

2110
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:09,312
You about it but this first one is about

2111
01:51:09,568 --> 01:51:10,848
Contacts if you will possibly

2112
01:51:11,104 --> 01:51:13,664

01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:21,088
Mike

2116
01:51:21,856 --> 01:51:25,440
So bizarre like when I was listening to it I thought I'm not well

2117
01:51:25,696 --> 01:51:27,744
I thought something was going on like

2118
01:51:28,512 --> 01:51:29,280
You pulling in some

2119
01:51:31,072 --> 01:51:31,584

01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:34,912
Awesome metaphor

2121
01:51:35,168 --> 01:51:36,704
Exact opposite

2122
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:38,496
Crazy like I really thought

2123
01:51:38,752 --> 01:51:40,032
I drank way too much

2124
01:51:46,432 --> 01:51:47,712
I got to quit drinking

2125
01:51:49,248 --> 01:51:51,552
I feel that way when I listen to Alex all the time

2126
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:05,120
I'll do it

2127
01:52:05,888 --> 01:52:07,680

01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:16,288
Probably negative

2147
01:53:16,544 --> 01:53:17,056

That is sort of the first

2164
01:53:57,760 --> 01:53:58,272
Extensive like

2165
01:53:58,528 --> 01:53:59,040
I think I'm losing

2166
01:54:00,576 --> 01:54:01,088
It goes on

2167
01:54:04,416 --> 01:54:06,720
You too late

2168
01:54:07,488 --> 01:54:10,048

Amazon stock price

2170
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:14,144

We'll make the joint and we'll send the primary residences with mother

2177
01:54:32,832 --> 01:54:35,648
Please implying there that the jury's ruling was based

2178
01:54:35,904 --> 01:54:36,928
And pity

2179
01:54:37,184 --> 01:54:37,696
Which is

2180
01:54:38,208 --> 01:54:38,976
Unconscionable

2181
01:54:39,232 --> 01:54:39,744
You should not

2182
01:54:40,768 --> 01:54:42,816
Leaving earlier he said that she went to a tree

2183
01:54:43,072 --> 01:54:44,608

2184
01:54:44,864 --> 01:54:46,144
Mexico

2185
01:54:46,656 --> 01:54:48,192
Which is very cruel

2186
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:54,080
Here he's saying that he underwent like the

2187
01:54:54,336 --> 01:54:56,384
The drug

2188
01:54:56,640 --> 01:54:57,920
Pregnant boat lady I guess

2189
01:54:58,432 --> 01:55:01,760
And then the problem started because she needed to go to it

2190
01:55:02,016 --> 01:55:02,528
2

2191
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:05,600
And because he doesn't get into it

2192
01:55:05,856 --> 01:55:06,368
The audience

2193
01:55:06,624 --> 01:55:09,952
Obviously goes to

2194
01:55:10,208 --> 01:55:11,744
Or she was pregnant on the boat

2195
01:55:12,256 --> 01:55:13,536
102

2196
01:55:13,792 --> 01:55:15,584
She didn't break the record

2197
01:55:18,912 --> 01:55:20,960
Right

2198
01:55:21,472 --> 01:55:21,984

I told you we are we are an exceptional family

2200
01:55:29,408 --> 01:55:31,200
Mainstream media is lying about the other lady

2201
01:55:31,968 --> 01:55:32,992
Totally boss

2202
01:55:35,552 --> 01:55:36,064
Okay

2203
01:55:36,832 --> 01:55:40,416
Because we didn't put all this on we were just like mister nice leading the whole thing

2204
01:55:40,928 --> 01:55:41,696
High Road

Press conference

2207
01:56:04,736 --> 01:56:06,016
Alison Roman

2208
01:56:07,808 --> 01:56:13,440
I think I'm hallucinating

2209
01:56:15,488 --> 01:56:17,280
It could be fishing

2210
01:56:17,536 --> 01:56:21,632
Said that had to set up about National alien

2211
01:56:21,888 --> 01:56:23,168
That's from Independence

2212
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:29,824
I don't I don't know what

2213
01:56:30,336 --> 01:56:34,944
I don't know because he's not making a coherent point he thinks it somehow is

2214
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:36,224
Proving that

2215
01:56:36,992 --> 01:56:39,808
She's wrong but

2216
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:42,368
I can't understand how

2217
01:56:42,624 --> 01:56:43,136
Because

2218
01:56:43,648 --> 01:56:44,672
So convoluted

2219
01:56:44,928 --> 01:56:45,952
Disease

2220
01:56:46,208 --> 01:56:50,560
How to evaluate

2221
01:56:51,072 --> 01:56:53,376
Was reporting multiple times that Alex

2222
01:56:53,632 --> 01:56:57,472
Was going to

2223
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:00,800
But did you see any of that

2224
01:57:03,616 --> 01:57:05,920
People covering it that there were like it looks like

2225
01:57:06,176 --> 01:57:06,688
He's going to

2226
01:57:06,944 --> 01:57:07,712
Because it is

2227
01:57:07,968 --> 01:57:10,784
A big deal

2228
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:11,808
Conservator

2229
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:13,600
Make these kids move

2230
01:57:13,856 --> 01:57:14,880
To a house that they

2231
01:57:15,392 --> 01:57:16,672
Leaving for the last key

2232
01:57:16,928 --> 01:57:18,720
Right

2233
01:57:20,768 --> 01:57:23,584
It's not massive on the scale of like you can't see this person

2234
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:25,120
Never again

2235
01:57:25,376 --> 01:57:27,936
But it is not a decision that made light

2236
01:57:28,448 --> 01:57:30,752
No it's ruining the lives

2237
01:57:31,008 --> 01:57:31,776
Children

2238
01:57:32,032 --> 01:57:33,312
And people

2239
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:36,384
Let's really pull the curtain back on the side

2240
01:57:36,896 --> 01:57:38,176
You're uprooting the live

2241
01:57:38,688 --> 01:57:39,968
White children

2242
01:57:40,992 --> 01:57:43,808
Ozon under the under the

2243
01:57:44,064 --> 01:57:46,368
Sort of the rug as it were with

2244
01:57:46,624 --> 01:57:50,208
People who are minorities in poor disenfranchised population

2245
01:57:50,464 --> 01:57:52,256
This is a celebrity's kids

2246
01:57:52,768 --> 01:57:54,048
Who's Richard

2247
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:55,840
So they would not

2248
01:57:56,096 --> 01:57:59,168
I think most of the reporting it was like he's probably going to win

2249
01:57:59,424 --> 01:58:01,216
We're in acknowledgement of like

2250
01:58:01,472 --> 01:58:03,520
I got to prove a case that they're going to change

2251
01:58:04,544 --> 01:58:05,056
And fact

2252
01:58:08,128 --> 01:58:08,896
There's absolutely

2253
01:58:09,152 --> 01:58:10,688
But also Alex

2254
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:18,624
Alex also debunks his whole entire press conference through screaming at the media bias

2255
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:20,928
Do all these media reports are saying I was going to win

2256
01:58:21,184 --> 01:58:27,328
The great when they agree with me they're bad when they disagree with me that's the that's the board that's a Baseline

2257
01:58:27,584 --> 01:58:28,352
Truth vs fake

2258
01:58:29,376 --> 01:58:29,888
Truth vs

2259
01:58:30,912 --> 01:58:31,424
Chirp

2260
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:32,448
Degreed with me

2261
01:58:32,704 --> 01:58:33,216
You're telling me

2262
01:58:33,728 --> 01:58:34,752
Replacement

2263
01:58:35,008 --> 01:58:36,544
Your fake news

2264
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:37,312
It's that simple

2265
01:58:37,568 --> 01:58:41,664
Bill O'Reilly's to have pinheads and Patriots

2266
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:43,456
No I don't

2267
01:58:43,712 --> 01:58:47,552
Where every week

2268
01:58:47,808 --> 01:58:49,088
And

2269
01:58:49,344 --> 01:58:49,856
Patriot

2270
01:58:50,112 --> 01:58:51,904
Also do you remember Sean Hannity

2271
01:58:52,160 --> 01:58:55,232
However

2272
01:58:55,488 --> 01:58:57,280
People would call in

2273
01:58:58,816 --> 01:59:01,632
Your great American

2274
01:59:04,448 --> 01:59:07,520
I miss that so much you are trustworthy

2275
01:59:08,032 --> 01:59:09,312
Is dependent upon how

2276
01:59:09,568 --> 01:59:15,456
Trustworthy you think I recognized the Great American in me and Ergo YouTube

2277
01:59:15,712 --> 01:59:21,088
I don't like Alex people being on hold for a long time ago

2278
01:59:24,416 --> 01:59:26,208
I wish I lived in that small

2279
01:59:27,232 --> 01:59:28,256
How easy is that

2280
01:59:28,512 --> 01:59:31,072
I don't know man just start doing it

2281
01:59:31,584 --> 01:59:34,912
We could start being like that all these people donating to a patreon

2282
01:59:39,776 --> 01:59:40,544
Starbucks

2283
01:59:42,592 --> 01:59:48,736
Clearly satire oh did you put your mask on

2284
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:54,624
A boy

2285
01:59:54,880 --> 01:59:57,184
Yeah put away this next clip is a Alex

2286
01:59:57,440 --> 01:59:58,720
Reading the series

2287
01:59:58,976 --> 02:00:00,000
The verdict

2288
02:00:00,256 --> 02:00:00,768
As it were

2289
02:00:01,792 --> 02:00:02,560
Don't remember why

2290
02:00:04,096 --> 02:00:05,120
We'll see

2291
02:00:06,144 --> 02:00:07,424
Children's

2292
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:16,128
He does not

2293
02:00:18,944 --> 02:00:19,712
Any of those words

2294
02:00:22,784 --> 02:00:25,344
Some is

2295
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:30,464
Start this from the beginning

2296
02:00:30,976 --> 02:00:31,488
It read

2297
02:00:32,768 --> 02:00:34,560
Exactly what he says it doesn't

2298
02:00:34,816 --> 02:00:36,352
And I remember now why this

2299
02:00:36,608 --> 02:00:37,120
Because

2300
02:00:37,376 --> 02:00:38,400
He's going to claim that this

2301
02:00:38,656 --> 02:00:39,168
Isn't the jury

2302
02:00:39,424 --> 02:00:39,936
Decision

2303
02:00:40,192 --> 02:00:41,472
But this is just what she wanted

2304
02:00:45,312 --> 02:00:46,848
Circumstances of children

2305
02:00:47,616 --> 02:00:49,408
Facts about a quarter and it goes on

2306
02:00:54,784 --> 02:00:55,552
Conservator

2307
02:01:02,208 --> 02:01:02,720
Get that

2308
02:01:02,976 --> 02:01:09,120
Possession Order possession

2309
02:01:10,912 --> 02:01:14,496
Visitation until

2310
02:01:19,104 --> 02:01:19,872
Witnesses

2311
02:01:37,792 --> 02:01:40,608
Yeah

2312
02:01:40,864 --> 02:01:42,656
When you want to discuss

2313
02:01:42,912 --> 02:01:45,728
The case and you claim you have documents

2314
02:01:46,240 --> 02:01:48,032
Portent to the case

2315
02:01:48,544 --> 02:01:49,312
Mnu

2316
02:01:49,568 --> 02:01:52,640
Do your press conference where you real on the media

2317
02:01:52,896 --> 02:01:53,664
And then

2318
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:56,480
You go into the private room in the courthouse

2319
02:01:56,736 --> 02:02:01,856
And you have a couple of documents and you don't really engaged

2320
02:02:02,112 --> 02:02:02,624
And then

2321
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:06,720
Your website doesn't even have those documents you don't

2322
02:02:06,976 --> 02:02:13,120
But you do publish the story of

2323
02:02:13,376 --> 02:02:14,656
You're not really

2324
02:02:15,936 --> 02:02:20,800
It might indicate the blah blah blah is kind of all you've got nothing he doesn't have anything

2325
02:02:21,056 --> 02:02:22,336
No

2326
02:02:23,104 --> 02:02:24,128
Reason

2327
02:02:25,152 --> 02:02:25,920
He doesn't have a case

2328
02:02:29,248 --> 02:02:29,760
He's not a good guy

2329
02:02:30,784 --> 02:02:31,552
Doesn't seem like it

2330
02:02:32,320 --> 02:02:32,832
I wouldn't want to be

2331
02:02:33,600 --> 02:02:35,904
Buckley seems to enjoy it

2332
02:02:37,440 --> 02:02:38,464
I wouldn't want

2333
02:02:38,976 --> 02:02:40,768
Be raised in a cult environment

2334
02:02:41,280 --> 02:02:43,840
As someone who was raised in a cult Environ

2335
02:02:46,144 --> 02:02:52,288
Closing statement

2336
02:02:53,824 --> 02:02:55,104
Is ex-wife

2337
02:02:55,360 --> 02:02:57,920
Closing statement Alex Jones is

2338
02:02:58,176 --> 02:03:01,248
Personally a cult leader to you someone

2339
02:03:01,504 --> 02:03:02,784
Behaves like that

2340
02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:05,600
It's obvious

2341
02:03:05,856 --> 02:03:08,928
It's so obvious to the point word

2342
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:10,720
Best to trickle down to

2343
02:03:10,976 --> 02:03:11,488
His personal life

2344
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:13,280
If you agree with him

2345
02:03:13,792 --> 02:03:14,304
You're good

2346
02:03:17,376 --> 02:03:18,912
If I'm a good guy

2347
02:03:19,424 --> 02:03:21,472
There's no way I'm going to

2348
02:03:22,752 --> 02:03:26,080
People that he has on his show on his phone

2349
02:03:26,336 --> 02:03:28,640
But when you're raising kids

2350
02:03:28,896 --> 02:03:30,688
That's the other thing

2351
02:03:30,944 --> 02:03:32,992
Imagine imagine you take

2352
02:03:33,248 --> 02:03:35,296
Even the slightest modicum of that

2353
02:03:36,064 --> 02:03:38,880
Good trust is you believe me

2354
02:03:39,392 --> 02:03:39,904
Globalist

2355
02:03:40,160 --> 02:03:40,672
Does you disbelieve

2356
02:03:42,976 --> 02:03:45,024
Anytime that child disagrees with

2357
02:03:46,048 --> 02:03:46,816
That is then

2358
02:03:47,328 --> 02:03:48,096
Exact

2359
02:03:49,376 --> 02:03:51,168
Every liar every

2360
02:03:52,448 --> 02:03:56,288
Vitamix

2361
02:03:56,544 --> 02:03:57,056
Pressure

2362
02:03:57,568 --> 02:03:58,848
To never say anything

2363
02:03:59,104 --> 02:03:59,616
Sing the Dozen

2364
02:03:59,872 --> 02:04:01,664
Agree with him

2365
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:02,944
Just make it to

2366
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:03,712
Whatever it is

2367
02:04:03,968 --> 02:04:05,504
He says is what you believe

2368
02:04:06,016 --> 02:04:07,040
Has to be so into

2369
02:04:07,296 --> 02:04:08,320
Horse

2370
02:04:08,832 --> 02:04:09,600
He's a cult leader in the

2371
02:04:10,112 --> 02:04:12,672
And you're going to be denying your own sort of

2372
02:04:13,696 --> 02:04:17,024
Existence your own reality in order to Boulder

2373
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:20,352
You're just a you're just a planet to his

2374
02:04:20,608 --> 02:04:21,120
Is solar

2375
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:28,544
I want to make it even further clear that like I'm a hundred percent and I agree with

2376
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:30,336
His ex-wife

2377
02:04:30,592 --> 02:04:33,152
You're not a cult leader why do you have

2378
02:04:33,664 --> 02:04:38,528
Cult leaders on your show regularly why do you have Stefan molyneux on

2379
02:04:38,784 --> 02:04:39,808
You know what

2380
02:04:40,064 --> 02:04:41,856
As defense

2381
02:04:42,112 --> 02:04:42,624
But he's not a call

2382
02:04:43,392 --> 02:04:43,904
Al

2383
02:04:44,160 --> 02:04:45,440
Don't hang out with it

2384
02:04:45,952 --> 02:04:47,488
Nobody

2385
02:04:47,744 --> 02:04:50,048
You're right

2386
02:04:50,304 --> 02:04:53,120
Hey you should check out this cold over here

2387
02:04:53,376 --> 02:04:55,680
If you're ambivalent

2388
02:04:56,960 --> 02:05:02,592
Add stuff for people to not eggs

2389
02:05:02,848 --> 02:05:04,640
Is it like not have people in their life who dis

2390
02:05:04,896 --> 02:05:05,408
Agree with his

2391
02:05:05,664 --> 02:05:07,456
Weird libertarian ideas

2392
02:05:07,712 --> 02:05:10,272
So you should cut people out of your life they don't agree with you

2393
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:11,808
The process called

2394
02:05:12,064 --> 02:05:12,576
Booing

2395
02:05:12,832 --> 02:05:16,160
Ridiculous B look into that s*** it's so insane

2396
02:05:17,696 --> 02:05:19,744
Cut off all ties with

2397
02:05:20,256 --> 02:05:24,864
There's actual website about people who have had to rebuild their lives

2398
02:05:25,376 --> 02:05:26,400
Because they were destroyed by

2399
02:05:26,656 --> 02:05:27,168
Saxofon molyneux

2400
02:05:27,424 --> 02:05:28,704
Philosophies

2401
02:05:29,728 --> 02:05:30,496
It's really crazy

2402
02:05:30,752 --> 02:05:32,544
He's a frequent

2403
02:05:33,056 --> 02:05:34,080

2404
02:05:34,336 --> 02:05:35,616
Created the proud boys

2405
02:05:36,384 --> 02:05:36,896
Which is

2406
02:05:37,664 --> 02:05:39,200
Essentially

2407
02:05:39,712 --> 02:05:42,528
Lately homo-erotic fraternity of dudes

2408
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:45,600
Into the idea of white males

2409
02:05:46,112 --> 02:05:47,136
Being in charge of every

2410
02:05:51,744 --> 02:05:52,512
Light

2411
02:05:52,768 --> 02:05:54,816
Mike cernovich is a lispy lawyer

2412
02:05:55,328 --> 02:05:55,840
I don't know

2413
02:05:56,096 --> 02:06:01,216
I'm not certain he has a cold but you know these are the sort of people who he have on his show

2414
02:06:01,472 --> 02:06:02,752

2418
02:06:08,640 --> 02:06:10,176
Generally have people who are like

2419
02:06:12,224 --> 02:06:13,248
Fuk fuk

2420
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:14,272
I just

2421
02:06:14,528 --> 02:06:15,552
Makes me really mad

2422
02:06:16,064 --> 02:06:18,112
Somebody should fight against

2423
02:06:19,392 --> 02:06:19,904
Baby I know it

2424
02:06:20,160 --> 02:06:26,048
