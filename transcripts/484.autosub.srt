00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,887
What are we

197
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:36,031
So there's a perm

198
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,311
Final statement

199
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:41,663
Ginsberg put out

200
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,199
Becomes a hinge

201
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,223
Upon which

202
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,503
Harrison Smith

203
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:49,343
Has his coverage rely on

204
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,879
Now as she was

205
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:53,695
Dying

206
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,719
Just days before her death

207
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,487
MPR

208
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,255
Article

209
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,023
Says

210
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,303
Strength

211
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,119
Ginsberg dictated this statement to her granddaughter

212
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:03,423
Quote my most fervent wish

213
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,703
Is that I will not be

214
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,471
Replaced

215
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,007
Until a new president

216
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,543
Install

217
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,847
Interesting choice of words

218
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,151
President being installed

219
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,479
CIA

220
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:23,391
Harrison Smith can go ahead and just f*** himself stranded very regularly used to describe the attention of someone

221
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,415
Position of leadership

222
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,951
Particularly presidency

223
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:32,607
If you just Google the terms install and president you'll find tons of articles that are based on press releases about

224
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,143
Things like Larry

225
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,239
Being installed as the president of the stock market

226
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:42,591
Hora 2019 announcement

227
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,639
Of the Minnesota Dental Association

228
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:51,551
If you can sell dictionaries the reason that this term is used regularly about heads of organizations is because it denotes that they're sending

229
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,599
That position requires a special ceremony

230
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,135
Like an inauguration

231
00:15:55,647 --> 00:16:00,255
Grammatically

232
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:03,583
I think of like some stickers they put in their man cave

233
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,631
And that's the point that they'll get somebody

234
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,679
Put him in there

235
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:10,239
Is technically true which is why we

236
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:15,615
There's a Supreme Court Justice that has to stand there and be like I swear you in

237
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:27,391
The word in this context doesn't mean that

238
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,951
To see Harris Harrison play this game

239
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:34,047
When it snowed here is Harrison is damn boring

240
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:34,815
He is

241
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,863
Trash is so bad at this

242
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,911
I don't care for him at all

243
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:42,495
And I was just sitting here thinking about all right

244
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,799
You're playing this weird word game

245
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:49,151
It's broken transparent you're not interesting

246
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:52,223
He saved the ship with that

247
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,271
I will be joined later in this

248
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,063
Is program a by Alex Jones

249
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,623
Who has some breaking news

250
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,183
Who Maybe

251
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:01,951
Appointed

252
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:02,975
5 president

253
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,023
Court Wendy's names off of

254
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,303
Shortlisted

255
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,071
Last week

256
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,399
So all right

257
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,959
Maybe be drunk

258
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:19,359
Yeah they'll be some kind of Firework

259
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,127
Harrison Smith Fathead

260
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:23,199
This guy is just

261
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:29,599
Is the f****** vocal patterns of

262
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,367
Alex

263
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,159
But in a very boring

264
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,439
And uninteresting way

265
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,975
Like the way he goes like

266
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,327
Coming up and

267
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,911
A vend

268
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,703
And so that's why

269
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:51,103
2650

270
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,407
Internet

271
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:55,199
Alex is made

272
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:57,503
I hosted is that evening show

273
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:01,087
But it I would not be surprised if pretty-much

274
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,623
All of his experience

275
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:05,695
In this Arena come from Infowars

276
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:09,023
If you will

277
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,559
Subway

278
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:16,703
Opportunity

279
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:21,055
Nonsense annoying

280
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:23,359
When it's coming from someone like Harrison

281
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,383
Course he was

282
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:28,991
DieHard leftist and was sort of the ringleader of the Liberals there on that cord

283
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:33,087
And was instrumental in making many decisions that we here on the right

284
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,367
Which consider

285
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,647
Severely damaging

286
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,415
Hugh

287
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:38,975
Our country

288
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:42,815
Female

289
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:46,911
I'm not going to stay

290
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,959
I'm not going to say anything bad

291
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,751
Not going to make any joke

292
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,519
About it

293
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,823
Not going to play any

294
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:55,871
Peaceful songs

295
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:56,895
The Wizard of Oz

296
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,175
Do no such thing

297
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,967
You're not here to celebrate

298
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,271
Death

299
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,087
Okay

300
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:07,135
She's the wicked witch

301
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,975
Without actually doing it

302
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,511
I'm not going

303
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,047
To celebrate her death

304
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:19,423
Yeah I'm going to sarcastically celebrate her

305
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,775
Difference being very classy by

306
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:28,639
Intimating how much

307
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:39,903
Very annoying

308
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:46,303
Somebody a little bit more

309
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,839
From him it's just

310
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:54,239
How do you can condescend

311
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:55,775
Like

312
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,055
Find myself

313
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:03,455
Eating boring people at more than 40%

314
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:05,759
Nonsense least entertain me

315
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,575
That I'm going to hate you

316
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:13,183
Your policies your beliefs are important

317
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:19,583
There's a special circle of hell

318
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:26,495
How to cover the story

319
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:33,663
Because it's breaking

320
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:40,063
Trump speech going on

321
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:44,159
For the

322
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,463
President-trump

323
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,487
At podium now

324
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:50,815
And we are eagerly awaiting the moment where

325
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:51,839
Maybe somebody in the

326
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:52,607
Krowd

327
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,375
Sees a tweet

328
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:54,911
And shouts this out

329
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,191
Or maybe an

330
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,471
Assistant Donald trumpkin

331
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,519
Sneak up and whisper in his ear

332
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,311
That Ruth Bader Ginsburg

333
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,079
Has passed away

334
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,383
And maybe homemade

335
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:05,663
A statement

336
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,943
About it that would be a

337
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:07,711
Ideal because

338
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:09,247
There's one thing we know about Trump

339
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,039
The cuff

340
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,063
Statements

341
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,343
Are often more truthful

342
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,135
And certainly more

343
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,159
Appropriate

344
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,184
Exciting than his

345
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,208
Prepared

346
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:20,000
So I need directions

347
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:23,072
There

348
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,352
Was him saying

349
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,632
Please tell us what to think

350
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:34,848
And if I do say what I want to say and it's wrong you're going to be mad at me and I don't want anybody to be mad at me

351
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:39,968
They're probably more eyes on this normal

352
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,856
He's trashed

353
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:49,184
Dingdong Outlet

354
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,792
This dweeb Affair Harrison

355
00:21:55,072 --> 00:22:01,216
Lose an inability to really

356
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:07,616
Is the moment the news head and he said it Alex should have come barreling and upgraded like tossed him to the side middle

357
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,088
Totoro

358
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:24,000
Harrison listen to Big Time

359
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:28,864
Rookie

360
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,288
Exactly

361
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:38,848
Florida

362
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:45,248
Yeah

363
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:53,440
When there's more people watching obviously you have an expectation or belief

364
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,976
You can monetize

365
00:22:55,488 --> 00:23:01,632
Impressions are everything in Harrison should not be your first impression

366
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:04,960
The Friday night we got a

367
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:05,728
The full crew

368
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:06,496
In the house

00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,776
Alex Jones is in the house

370
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,056
Of course we have

371
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:11,360
Norm pattis on the line at 2

372
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,640
Breakdown everything

00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,200
All of the all of the

374
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,992
Incredible

375
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,808
Events that will now be put in

376
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:20,576
Into motion

377
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,368
Now the truth

378
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:23,904
Bader Ginsburg

379
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,184
Passed away

380
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,208
At the age

381
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:27,232
AB 87

00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:29,536
For everything that we do all of these great gas

00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:18,976
It's definitely not been here that I have been more disappointed in literally everyone on the planet than ever

585
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,512
Ever

586
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:26,912
No it hasn't

587
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:29,984
Florida casket

588
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:32,800
I don't know

589
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:39,456
Already

590
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:41,248
And it's just funny

591
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:48,160
Neither of them are his lawyer in the Sandy Hook case anymore but still coming on

592
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:48,928
Wrong with people

593
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:55,840
Because this

594
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,448
This year's

595
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:05,824
This point

596
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,664
And our ancestors

597
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,968
Try now and our very selves

598
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,160
Soon as I go on air

599
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,440
All my old

600
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,000
Ultimate Muscle

601
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,328
Because it's a war

602
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:31,936
Something wrong with you

603
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:57,024
Weird

604
00:38:57,536 --> 00:39:03,680
Explanation

605
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:07,520
Into my two former lawyers are going to come

606
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,568
Yeah

607
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:15,968
Fighting the literal Christian devil in just to prove to you that we are fighting him I am going to make little

608
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:22,368
Real demon sounds

609
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:32,352
Suspicious don't worry about it

610
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:36,448
Can I get on

611
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:46,688
Whatever whatever anybody's like stage Health in stand-up comedy

612
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:52,832
Pumped full of adrenaline and then you get off at your Journal that goes away in your I still feel like s***

613
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:58,720
One of the things that I noticed regularly

614
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:01,280
Getting onstage in front of a bunch of people

615
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:04,608
He's a really effective hangover cure

616
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:09,728
Whatever the adrenaline boost and and

617
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:16,384
The feeling that you have of the pressure if it takes a ways

618
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:22,784
Totally later

619
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,344
Is to drink

620
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:31,744
Wow you're onstage hangover

621
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:38,144
Really good afterwards

622
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,496
Danny's Auto Saturday night

623
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,248
Maybe he's been away

624
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,048
Stop music

625
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:09,888
Mikado

626
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:10,656
And Trump

627
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,704
That's a no-brainer

628
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:19,616
Words

629
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,384
Gator

630
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:22,176
And our most fervent wish

631
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:24,992
Is that I not

632
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:26,528
Until

633
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,296
New president

634
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,320
Easy install

635
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:38,048
How old is the purple used

636
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:46,240
Stalled

637
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:47,008
What did

638
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,824
No no never

639
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:51,360
President can't be installed

640
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:58,271
Nope words don't mean anything except for what I want that debate

641
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,551
This is good

642
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:02,623
This work

643
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:04,415
Wordplay Tate

644
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:09,791
Theory

645
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:12,607
Kim Jong on in

646
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,031
Whatever wants

647
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,895
Kim Jong uninstalled

648
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:26,431
North Korean supreme leader

649
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:30,783
Let's see if my memory is

650
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:41,023
Who's grey radio

651
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:42,047
Wow so good

652
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:48,447
You have years ago

653
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,471
Install

654
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:06,111
Very classy

655
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:07,647
Classy Chassis

656
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:14,303
Stuff

657
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:20,703
Words

658
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:24,031
To know that no matter how eloquent your argument

659
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:26,591
If there's a crowd of people just chanting in

660
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:28,895
Install

661
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:29,919
Right you are

662
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:33,503
Yahoo matter what your argument is out there screaming

663
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:42,207
You know okay fine I guess that's what you got

664
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:48,863
Install over and over again

665
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:54,495
Keep yelling that dictionary definition of install

666
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:56,287
Alex there's more than one

667
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:05,247
So I had told him it would probably going to be

668
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:13,951
In that back a little bit more General

669
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,071
I'll bet my

670
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:21,887
If a woman

671
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:23,423
As long as

672
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,031
I just don't

673
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:37,247
Boat life

674
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:45,183
Saying if you think it could be a woman

675
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,719
Which is fine

676
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:02,335
The night before said that inside sources from the White House we're saying

677
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,359
Barrett

678
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,895
Right now

679
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:09,759
He is a little more General

680
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:11,551
Seems like you would continue

681
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:13,087
Being like the word is

682
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:17,183
Pretty fast in her favor

683
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:25,119
I mean we've already had blood sacrifice

684
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:29,215
Even stranger because Alex suggest

685
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:35,615
B maybe it's possible there Ruth Gator Ginsburg

686
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:38,943
A weeks

687
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:43,039
They wanted to wait

688
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:44,831
We could

689
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:49,951
Hospital

690
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:56,095
Close

691
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:01,471
McConnell

692
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:03,007
Because

693
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,079
Walmart

694
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:14,015
Totally understand why people retreat

695
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,039
Conspiracy theories now

696
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:18,623
Right now I'm imagining living in a world where

697
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:24,767
Ruth Bader Ginsburg with Dedham

698
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:26,559
Chicago

699
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:29,119
I guess I would ask why

700
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:35,519
This argument doesn't hold water

701
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:41,663
You wanted to push it forward in order for it to be more of a tense situation

702
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:46,015
If it's April

703
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:46,783
.

704
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:52,927
For your buck

705
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:59,583
Scalia died and it was a big tension situation

706
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:05,983
Especially during an election cycle primaries or any

707
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:20,575
Mitch McConnell doesn't have the time to organize everybody

708
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:22,623
Cuz if you had those extra 4 weeks

709
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:26,975
Yeah I'm sure

710
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:29,023
By the time this episode comes out

711
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:35,167
Course not

712
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:41,055
Recognizes

713
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:43,871
The even he's not so stupid that he doesn't realize I

714
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:46,943
I'm going to suggest that she's been dead for a month

715
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:52,063
Ever reason

716
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,343
Doesn't support it

717
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:56,671
Conclusion but

718
00:47:56,927 --> 00:48:00,255
Good

719
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:03,071
But now that I know she's already been dead for a month

720
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:04,607
That's even more

721
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:08,191
Akon Ginsburg

722
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:14,847
This is what we get from Schumer and Pelosi if they had a month to think about it buddy.

723
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:18,431
Who needs an Okanagan

724
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:25,855
Source

725
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:28,927
Secret

726
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:29,695
Silly

727
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:32,767
Oh good anyway Alex

728
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:34,047
He's really

729
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:36,351
Enjoying shiting on

730
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:40,703
The dad

731
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,543
It's part of an anti-human

732
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:46,079
Pilobolus

733
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:51,199
Dollar Oregon

734
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:54,271
You just talkin s***

735
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:56,575
Yep

736
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:07,327
Clarence Thomas needs to get out of there

737
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:11,935
So they can replace him with someone

738
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:13,983
Effectively

739
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:16,287
4 of 9

740
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:23,967
Call mickley stupid

741
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:27,807
Text Thomas got to go app

742
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:29,855
In Antarctica

743
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:31,903
I don't know

744
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:36,511
In talking about this

745
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:38,559
But he can't remember his name

746
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:42,143
Thomas

747
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:50,847
Bad guy

748
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:52,639
I do

749
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:53,663
Kelis.

750
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:02,879
He's always imitating

751
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:04,927
Grover Cleveland

752
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:14,655
Shelia.

753
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:16,447
Bohemian Grove

754
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:25,663
Obviously

755
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:28,991
Definitely murder

756
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:35,391
So big I could never forget his name

757
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:45,631
Tobacco down

758
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,703
To Ruth Gator Ginsburg

759
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:51,007
I mean

760
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:58,943
Railway

761
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:00,991
Define descender

762
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:05,855
Happy birthday

763
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:07,647
I'm all out

764
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:08,415
Women's empowerment

765
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,023
Establishment

766
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:17,887
Two channels

767
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:19,423
National

768
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:23,775
When You Believe

769
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:28,383
Any days equivalent to murdering babies after they're born

770
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:36,063
Isn't that position we're not going to

771
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:38,111
Change their mind unless they're

772
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:40,159
Internally motivated to do so

773
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:43,231
Nothing you can say is going to be effective

774
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:44,511
Nope they're gone

775
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:46,815
Damn it's just gone

776
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:51,167
Ginsburg and

777
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:52,703
You know

So Norm comes

795
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:16,671
Why I wouldn't be

796
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,719
The Southern dish

797
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:19,743
New York Mets

Surprise moving Navy craft

799
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:22,303
Make a move

800
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:23,071
Donald Trump

801
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:25,375
Distracting

802
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:28,703
Seizing the narrative

803
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:34,847
Someone

804
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:35,871
Donald Trump

805
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:37,407
About

806
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:39,455
Until you had about coming in

807
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:43,295
And going

808
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:47,647
Then brought up

809
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:50,719
Wanted to have replaced

810
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:51,487
Amy

811
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:52,511
Tony Bear

812
00:53:58,655 --> 00:53:59,423
Why was

813
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:00,447
Confusing

814
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:02,495
Why is

815
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:08,895
Norm pattis having a meeting with someone

816
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:18,367
I don't know

817
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:25,791
If any of that is true I'm not stuck

818
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:32,703
I'm not Stokes at anybody's in those positions where they can have those connections

819
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:38,335
That is the Eternal question

820
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:44,223
That we will never know Coney Barrett

821
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:45,247
Is

822
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:49,599
The choice

823
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:53,183
The cheese

824
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:53,951
The front-runner

825
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:59,071
Like

826
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:02,143
Yeah yeah she's religious she's a Christian

827
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:12,895
B never say that about a Muslim or a lot

828
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:16,991
They only think it's a problem

829
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:18,527
Yeah but

830
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:22,879
Democrat

831
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:26,463
QRS become more evil

832
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:27,999
Overtime

833
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:29,791
How I think this

834
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:37,215
Loepsie reform

835
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:47,199
You know I wish I knew I liked

836
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:52,063
We no longer have it

837
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:53,599
Values

838
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:54,367
Call about idea

839
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:55,391
Power

840
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:56,671
Demography

841
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:57,439
Demography

842
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:58,207
Demography

843
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:00,255
Demographic

844
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:02,303
Democrats

845
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:05,119
An emerging majority

846
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:05,887
And decide

847
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:14,847
I think what happened was the Democrats

848
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,919
That's exactly what he said

849
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:24,319
He said they're going with the emerging

850
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:30,463
Power

851
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:32,255
And that is

852
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:36,863
Bummer for Norm

853
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:38,911
I mean

854
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:42,239
Is a lawyer

855
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:46,591
You can just if you can pass the bar it doesn't matter if you're not

856
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:52,479
Makes me really worried

857
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:53,759
I was very

858
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:55,039
Peterbilt

859
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:56,063
Courage

860
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:58,367
Four districts in

861
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:01,695
Because I think that it's

862
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:02,719
Some level it wouldn't

863
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:03,487
Surprise me

864
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:06,047
Breck the arrest

865
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:07,583
Or various

866
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:08,351
Amun-ra

867
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:11,167
The same people

868
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:12,191
Traveling from

869
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:13,215
The city

870
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:14,239
Condo for whatever

871
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:17,311
Forman Mills

872
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:21,663
Vons brother

873
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:24,479
Publicly

874
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:31,135
Defense fund

875
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:33,183
To really work on that

876
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:39,583
Going to happen

877
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:50,335
Disturbed me about that patterns are what

878
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:52,639
Charged with sedition

879
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:59,039
Any reason to believe

880
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:01,855
This is the case

881
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:07,487
The idea that all of these protesters in various cities are the same people going around

882
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:08,767
Of course that's

883
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:15,679
We're not responsible protesters in your city

884
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:16,703
Saving yourself

885
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:23,103
You're saving the entire country cuz those protesters would just go to another city and bother other people Dan

886
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:26,175
Pretty disturbing

887
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:29,503
Kind of thinking to have

888
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:31,551
Sonoran sucks

889
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:37,695
I don't care for him

890
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:44,607
And now you got Alex's put a lawyer

891
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:47,167
Buy Barnwood we got from Bart

892
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:48,959
Clear now

893
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:50,239
He withheld information

894
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:51,775
The dire nature

895
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:53,823
He was clearly in far worse

896
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:55,359
Turn the night light on

897
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:56,639
Whether she was

898
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:57,407
Trying to

899
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:58,431
You stay alive or

900
00:58:58,943 --> 00:58:59,455
Publicly

901
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:01,247
Be seen as being alive until

902
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:03,295
After the election is what

903
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:04,319
Some people who

904
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:05,599
The timing of the

905
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:06,367
The disclosure of

906
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:08,927
This was a meant to be election influence

907
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:09,951
We'll never know the

908
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:10,975
The full truth

909
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:11,743
Because they were able

910
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:13,535
Information about her health

911
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:15,327
What's so secret there's a cover-up

912
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:16,863
So you're saying that

913
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:19,679
The Democrats

914
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:22,495
Have maybe been Weekend at Bernie's in

915
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:23,775
Ruth Bader Ginsburg

916
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:30,175
I mean that's one reading you could take other comets

917
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:36,831
North North

918
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:42,207
Dead for awhile, guy

919
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:43,487
He's a lawyer

920
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:45,535
Just not good

921
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:50,399
Recovery

922
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:52,191
Ruth Bader Ginsburg

923
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:55,775
Over the past year

924
00:59:56,287 --> 01:00:00,383
Hyper focused on how situation

925
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:04,735
I don't know how much of a cover-up of the severity of her health issues

926
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:11,135
There is considering all these headlines about her going to the hospital over and over again

927
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:16,511
If she goes to the hospital the entire f****** new system breaks down and everyone's like

928
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:24,191
Everybody's holding their breath cuz we're going to the hospital again

929
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:33,919
True

930
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:40,831
Bart predictions

931
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:42,367
It's going to be a woman

932
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:48,511
Tom Cotton

933
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:49,279
No

934
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:50,815
Slightly different

935
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:53,631
The guy would be

936
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:55,423
Menomonee and now there's report sets

937
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:56,191
Today the cheese

938
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:56,959
Easily

939
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:59,519
She's a cuban-american daughter of immigrants

940
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:01,567
Spanish in English from Miami

941
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:03,871
Play well-regarded

942
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:04,639
Conservative

943
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:05,407
On the court

944
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:06,175
Comes from that tour

945
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:08,223
Conservative tradition

946
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:09,759
So she did

947
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:13,855
Ron Ely

948
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:16,671
Fort Collins

949
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,207
Turn down her

950
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:19,231
Okay

951
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:21,279
That's weird to

952
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:27,935
We got it

953
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:29,727
That's alright

954
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:36,639
Are there any more racist lawyers in Colorado

955
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:38,687
Democrats

956
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:45,087
And if we get a Cuban Zone

957
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:52,767
Buck Oliver Barrett

958
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:59,167
Yeah why not

959
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:04,031
Amy

960
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:05,055
Tony Barrett

961
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:07,871
She's just as conservative

962
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:09,919
He's a beautiful Latina

963
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:12,479
What are we doing

964
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:16,831
What are we doing what are we doing

965
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:20,671
Tokenism

966
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:28,863
Barnes

967
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:32,191
What you saying is true or not

968
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:32,959
Cuz

969
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:38,335
I didn't care

970
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:41,663
Pretty compelling reasons why Amy Coney Barrett

971
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:43,711
Should not be on the Supreme Court

972
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:47,807
The the playoffs

973
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:49,087
Tippi humor

974
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:53,183
Alex

975
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:54,719
I think Barrett

976
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:56,767
Most nominations but I'm not

977
01:02:58,047 --> 01:02:58,559
Bear attack

978
01:02:58,815 --> 01:02:59,583
Beard is make

979
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:02,399
The effect that she won't she's that you don't accuse her

980
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:03,935
Fell from a decision where the Pope

981
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:06,239
Which I don't know which means

982
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:08,031
When did rulon abortions

983
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:12,383
Exactly

984
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:14,431
Come out on immigration

985
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:18,783
That's completely the opposite of how they were discussing her face

986
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:24,927
Okay

987
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:31,071
This is so this is where we get into the situation that we've described a million times

988
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:31,839
Exclusive

989
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:32,863
Group right

990
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:33,887
Okay

991
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:38,495
All Christians are fighting now the Muslims guess who we hate Catholics

992
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:44,895
It's not hard to read this coming

993
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:52,319
I would say that

994
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:56,159
Pope would have a difficult time controlling

995
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,695
Those Supreme Court

996
01:03:58,207 --> 01:04:04,351
If one person recuse themselves using

997
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:10,751
Everything

998
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:13,055
So I would say that that makes you

999
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:17,663
That is effective as a Supreme Court Justice if you're going to

1000
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:19,455
Yourself

1001
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:23,295
Only rule on things

1002
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:25,855
Pet My Religion doesn't have a stance on

1003
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:31,487
My religion is Catholicism notorious for not having a stance on literally everything

1004
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:32,511
Yeah

1005
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:36,607
So I drop being real smart

1006
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:38,911
And I think that this is makgeolli

1007
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:40,447
The other problem

1008
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:43,519
Lockdown

1009
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:44,543
So the

1010
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:46,847
Intelligence

1011
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:48,127
Owning certain

1012
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:49,663
Stimulus benefits and the rest is

1013
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:50,687
People started to realize

1014
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:51,967
They're real economic

1015
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:53,503
Real social Harms

1016
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:54,783
Author of what

1017
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:56,063
Of the lockdown today

1018
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:56,831
More dangerous than

1019
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:58,111
I've been covid

1020
01:04:58,623 --> 01:05:00,159
So do you understand why that's stupid

1021
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:04,255
Sony re

1022
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,047
Patricia

1023
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:07,839
Trump smart

1024
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:16,543
Because then people will start feeling Economic Consequences of the lockdown

1025
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:18,335
Created at least partially or

1026
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:21,663
Maybe even mostly Shoreline Highway of a Steelers

1027
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:30,367
Taking away a lot of the people's motivations the calves are protesting

1028
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:41,119
Virus outbreak

1029
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:45,471
Much faster much less death much less

1030
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:50,079
Economic consequences

1031
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:55,967
Dropping smartphone

1032
01:05:56,223 --> 01:06:00,575
We could have had an election that was a referendum on

1033
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:04,671
Trump's surprisingly perfect handling of a global pandemic

1034
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:08,255
What if we have gotten through this all fine people would have been like

1035
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:14,655
Wow I guess he is a good president he got us through this pandemic that would have rolled along to re-election

1036
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:18,751
Killed hundreds of thousands of people

1037
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:24,895
Purposely in order to teach them a lesson about not getting uppity about wanting s***

1038
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:32,831
Can work you idiots I'll teach you please how to do your job if it kills me

1039
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:35,391
Really weird

1040
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:37,183
Rationalization

1041
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:39,999
What you're talkin about like a really smart

1042
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:44,863
To deprive people of something

1043
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:47,423
Bad

1044
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:51,775
You know what I'm saying.

1045
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:53,567
Man

1046
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:59,967
UA doesn't seem like the bar is as hard as they described it must not be either that or you don't have

1047
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:01,759
Just think about anything else ever

1048
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:08,159
Maybe you're in you're in

1049
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:10,207
Like I said Murderers Row

1050
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:12,767
This dude

1051
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:16,095
I don't know what the f***** going on but

1052
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:18,399
Is all over Infowars these days

1053
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:19,167
Alright

1054
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:22,495
Xander is

1055
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:23,775
Grateful

1056
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:26,079
Great talk show host

1057
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:27,615
And writer and researcher

1058
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:28,895
He's on the road

1059
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:30,175
Chicago

1060
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:33,503
How do you miss that

1061
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:39,391
I do love to go see Alexander

1062
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:40,159
You know it

1063
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:42,463
In the city

1064
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:47,071
7 groundhog Trail

1065
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:50,143
We would have had to go buy tomatoes

1066
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:56,543
What's that expensive

1067
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:15,487
Holly Farm to face it is I don't know what the f*** is going on

1068
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:17,279
This dude cuz he's terrible

1069
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:18,815
Is

1070
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:23,935
He's a little bit more interesting than like Harrison Smith

1071
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:29,311
Wako super

1072
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:32,383
Alero

1073
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:35,967
Like

1074
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:40,575
Harrison be like a cardboard cutout

1075
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:44,671
But I don't know why he's all over Infowars

1076
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:46,719
The last couple months

1077
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:50,815
I don't know what the deal is I don't know if he has some sort of a contract or

1078
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:53,375
Anything it's just it's noticeable

1079
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:54,911
All the time oh wow

1080
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:56,703
And

1081
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:57,471
Yeah

1082
01:08:57,983 --> 01:08:58,751
You got some ideas

1083
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:00,031
Abortion

1084
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:02,079
Got the blood sacrifice all right

1085
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:04,895
Sacrifices

1086
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:06,687
Now BMO

1087
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:08,223
Erection

1088
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:09,503
In American

1089
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:10,271
History

1090
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:11,807
31

1091
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:14,111
Whether or not

1092
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:15,391
Millions of

1093
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:16,159
Children

1094
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:17,951
Continue to get aborted or not

1095
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:18,975
The waxes go

1096
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:21,023
Super violin

1097
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:25,887
Supreme Court before the

1098
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:28,959
We really got it

1099
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:30,751
Materials because

1100
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:31,775
Ennui

1101
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:33,567
You've never seen a West O'Farrell

1102
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:34,847
And when we are threat

1103
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:35,871
Takeaway

1104
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:36,895
Their blood.

1105
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:38,943
And that is the abortion

1106
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:40,991
So

1107
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:45,087
The blood sacrifice

1108
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:45,855
What do you think

1109
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:46,879
Icing

1110
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:54,815
Empowers the globalist or whatever

1111
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:58,399
Function or whatever

1112
01:09:58,655 --> 01:09:59,679
Then you need to leave

1113
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:06,591
You can't be a part of this you can't take part in the American largesse the free-speech rights that are

1114
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:08,895
Guaranteed by the government

1115
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:10,175
Use our roads

1116
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:16,319
No because you know that exists because of blood sacrifices to the devil

1117
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:17,855
You can't leave here

1118
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:24,255
It is wanting to fight back against

1119
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:26,303
And if you don't want to live in reality

1120
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:32,703
Then go somewhere where you can live in your reality don't make me live your fakeness

1121
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:38,591
There's a thought experiment

1122
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:41,407
First-year philosophy class

1123
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:43,711
Thought experiment

1124
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:51,135
I think.

1125
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:56,255
Everything operates really well people there are largely

1126
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:58,047
Good

1127
01:10:58,303 --> 01:11:01,375
Point everyone when they're like

1128
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:03,423
18 or whatever they get

1129
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:04,703
2

1130
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:11,103
See what goes on in this secret room the only reason that these societies able to function as

1131
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:14,431
Because one child is getting kicked out of them

1132
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:17,247
Constantly forever

1133
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:23,647
Doctor Who episode is well

1134
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:28,511
You approach it from an ethical position and what can you do

1135
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:33,631
You can only lead you can't take part in this Society

1136
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:40,031
Or whatever

1137
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:47,199
Death of everybody else

1138
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:53,855
Generally speaking the correct position is too late you can only afford to live by your own

1139
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:54,879
Principles

1140
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:59,231
To try and make a rational rationalizes like

1141
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:04,607
The needs of the many outweigh the few so this is so I'm fine with this is a

1142
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:08,191
Ridiculous argument

1143
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:12,287
If you are applying it to other people without their knowledge

1144
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:18,687
You know like taking the kid and killing all of the people in this life

1145
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:25,087
Society

1146
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:31,487
Operate

1147
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:38,143
If it didn't somehow give them something they want it we're so

1148
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:45,055
To be in power or

1149
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:47,871
I have our society function in the

1150
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:49,151
Therefore

1151
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:51,199
Alex

1152
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:57,855
Read if you do I mean more like

1153
01:12:58,367 --> 01:13:04,511
Also it's a bulshit thing for them to say anyway if you really believe that abortion was a blood sacrifice

1154
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:07,839
That happens to 50 million babies a year

1155
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:09,119
And your

1156
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:12,447
On the f****** phone talking to Alex Jones

1157
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:13,215
UF

1158
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:13,983
No

1159
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:18,079
Moral principles whatsoever making up that b*******.

1160
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:22,943
You like that you have

1161
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:27,807
Is facilitated by

1162
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:29,855
You're complicit

1163
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:33,439
Unlikely unless you lyrics

1164
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:36,255
Stop

1165
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:42,143
Just go it's silly

1166
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:43,423
Go on get out of

1167
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:48,543
About

1168
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:52,127
Sharpay needs control history

1169
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:54,687
That's why they're all over the University

1170
01:13:54,943 --> 01:14:01,087
History

1171
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:09,535
And Alex is very very interested in this

1172
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:10,303
Very easy

1173
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:12,863
So fascinated by you

1174
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:16,191
Oh no

1175
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:18,239
They want to rewrite it

1176
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:20,031
It was the

1177
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:21,055
The Bible

1178
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:23,615
The southerners it was

1179
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:24,895
You know the right wing

1180
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:27,455
Authoritarian

1181
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:29,247
You guys are filled over

1182
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:30,015
100 million

1183
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:30,783
People

1184
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:42,303
You know I don't know

1185
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:44,863
That's a scary place

1186
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:45,631
Place to go

1187
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:54,079
Yeah there may not be any

1188
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:05,599
I got a Subway

1189
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:11,999
About how

1190
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:14,303
Increase

1191
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:15,071
Security

1192
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:19,935
And stop because their tongue people were willing

1193
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:21,471
The dye for

1194
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:22,751
Yeah there

1195
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:24,031
People who are willing to die

1196
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:25,567
Abortion to the Lone Wolf

1197
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:29,151
Maybe thousand

1198
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:32,991
Good luck

1199
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:38,367
Houses

1200
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:44,767
Is he your lunch break is

1201
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:57,567
Need to make sure that your lawyer taking your lunch break I have nothing but disrespect for Allie Alexander

1202
01:15:57,823 --> 01:16:03,967
And so I don't mind him being treated this way

1203
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:07,039
It's rude if I were him I would not put up with

1204
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:09,599
It's rude to eat on the air.

1205
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:15,999
Yeah the doughboys

1206
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:21,887
Somebody on live broadcast

1207
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:28,287
Respond

1208
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:32,127
Batman with your f****** mouth full

1209
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:34,943
Rude

1210
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:48,255
Could you please stop eating

1211
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:53,631
I think Alex

1212
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:09,759
Subway

1213
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:13,855
Yeah I think

1214
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:16,927
Honestly honestly

1215
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:17,695
Honestly

1216
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:18,975
Like honestly

1217
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:20,255
Feces

1218
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:26,655
Medium bad texts that I've read about

1219
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:35,103
News guy

1220
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:37,407
Real failure problem

1221
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:44,063
Romy was on on the 18th for a short. Of time

1222
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:55,839
Things got real

1223
01:17:56,095 --> 01:18:01,471
Sacrifices

1224
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:10,943
Perfect

1225
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:12,479
Donut

1226
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:13,247
Wooden Gray

1227
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:21,695
Conversations with his two former lawyers

1228
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:22,719
Reveals

1229
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:23,743
So much

1230
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:33,983
Just completely

1231
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:46,527
Compared

1232
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:49,343
With fashion

1233
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:55,743
You know what that's probably smarter I think really doesn't have to worry about places he's not allowed to practice law

1234
01:18:55,999 --> 01:19:01,375
Hippies in the fashion frizzy

1235
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:05,983
Great American Law Center whatever

1236
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:16,223
Criminal

1237
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:22,623
Barnes go on Stefan molyneux

1238
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:24,159
All the time

1239
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:25,695
He's clearly up to no good

1240
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:32,607
Norm is more just a sort of shady lawyer

1241
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:39,007
Conversations

1242
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:52,575
Dignified Behavior

1243
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:58,207
Surprising because it probably will play out like this

1244
01:19:58,463 --> 01:19:59,999
Ferrets nomination will be

1245
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:02,303
Torpedoed by the fact that she's a Catholic

1246
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:06,399
Isn't that hilarious

1247
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:07,423
I mean

1248
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:10,751
I don't think

1249
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:15,616
Probably from just like a utility standpoint

1250
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:19,200
Somebody who's on record as saying that they have to recuse themselves

1251
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:23,040
In any matter that the pope has weighed in

1252
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:29,440
That's not necessarily what I would describe as just being Catholic

1253
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:39,424
If you're putting someone on a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court assure themselves

1254
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:45,824
To God

1255
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:48,384
So I mean just Jerry can do like

1256
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:51,712
Reno Catholic

1257
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:57,344
True

1258
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:02,720
I don't know

1259
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:03,488
Tragic

1260
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:08,352
Or Gator Ben Berg

1261
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:13,472
Very sad for you know her family and for what

1262
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:15,008
They could pretend

1263
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:18,080
Flippant

1264
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:19,360
Naturally

1265
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:23,456
Exactly

1266
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:29,088
It is absolute tragedy and icon

1267
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:36,256
Well deserve the peso and this is affecting a lot of people problems with her record

1268
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:41,632
That was more a conversation that was relevant for

1269
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:42,912
No historian yeah

1270
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:44,192
Supposed

1271
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:45,728
You trying to be like

1272
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:48,800
She wasn't that great

1273
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:55,200
I'm not even saying that might not necessarily be fair

1274
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:56,992
I just don't know

1275
01:21:57,248 --> 01:22:00,320
Do you serve in the immediate

1276
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:03,136
Yeah

1277
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:04,672
You know obviously

1278
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:05,696
I'm worried

1279
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:09,536
I'm worried about the directions

1280
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:13,632
Now

1281
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:14,656
Time Warner

1282
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:15,424
We really

1283
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:19,520
Have to be as active as we can be

1284
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:22,080
In terms of protecting people

1285
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:23,360
And they're right

1286
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:25,664
There is a there's going to be

1287
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:30,784
I'm at quite frankly very cognizant of the fact

1288
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:33,856
That there are some responsibilities that we have

1289
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:36,672
To not allow

1290
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:39,488
As much as I possibly could

1291
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:42,048
I don't know how we do that

1292
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:42,816
I don't know

1293
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:48,448
I would take mail your Senator a letter call call them

1294
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:59,712
Pre-election appointment

1295
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:00,736
With people

1296
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:04,576
Batman you look at Byzantine nonsense rules

1297
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:12,256
Everybody's talking about how they could do all these parliamentary procedures to just delay it by time and your life

1298
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:14,048
What world do we live in

1299
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:15,328
This is Magic

1300
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:18,144
We just were living by Arcane nonsense rules

1301
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:18,912
What are we doing

1302
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:19,680
Show up

1303
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:23,776
Now maybe

1304
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:30,432
Then surround the building and all the sudden all the rules go away

1305
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:32,736
Magic

1306
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:37,600
I don't know I don't know

1307
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:39,136
I'm not good at

1308
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:41,184
Having ideas of what to do

1309
01:23:45,536 --> 01:23:47,584
But laughing at his dumbass that's what we got

1310
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:48,352
Yep

1311
01:23:55,008 --> 01:24:01,152
Smile.com

1312
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:03,712
Go to bed Jordan

1313
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:10,112
Ever now we're on Facebook

1314
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:11,904
Write your congressman

1315
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:17,792
Write your family's and find a local bail fund or charity in your area

1316
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:23,168
Leo on dbx

1317
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:24,960
Barrel run

1318
01:24:25,216 --> 01:24:28,288
I could do Harrison Smith job better than he can

1319
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:30,336
And I don't believe any of that s***

1320
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:35,968
Alex

1321
01:24:36,224 --> 01:24:38,016
Same color
