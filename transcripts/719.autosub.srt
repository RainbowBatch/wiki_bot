Everybody

00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:02,720
Acknowledge

00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:08,352
Alex Jones

Jordan

10
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:17,824
Summer

11
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,104
Naturally have been

12
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,384
Citgo in the end

13
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,152
My mouth

14
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,944
That it hasn't slowed down

15
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,088
Since I've been gone and it's been going at full speed I think I'm up around like

16
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,368
Maybe 60

17
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,416
60 ice cream I think so yeah

18
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,976
Part of the problem is

19
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:38,048
It's it can be tough to find enough variety

20
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:42,144
Easily accessible things special order

21
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:45,472
Get dry ice delivery

22
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,776
Listen to most of the best ice creams I've had it been in

23
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:53,152
San Francisco and you're going to have to go a long way for that s*** and a couple times I've tried to order like ice cream cake

24
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,576
But I think

25
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:04,160
I think there's obviously still a good couple weeks

26
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:07,744
December 2nd

27
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:10,304
But right now I am feeling like

28
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:13,888
I'm pretty close to giving the title to cool house

29
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:18,240
Cool house house

30
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:24,640
I think that their consistency is pretty solid okay like across the different flavors of ice cream sandwiches and

31
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:25,920
Novelties restaurant

32
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:26,944
Hole not like

33
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,736
Best ice cream

34
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:35,136
Producer of ice cream I think so I got sober at All-Star from them

35
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:38,720
Probably be the street churro cone

36
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:39,488
That sounds

37
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,024
Amazing yeah it's it's

38
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,584
It's quite good I enjoyed it it's

39
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,608
So yeah

40
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,424
I want to talk about is a little head to head challenge

41
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,288
I wanted to try now popovers any other

42
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:58,688
Insurers are regrettable yeah they're almost there almost enough to get me to buy a box of that sin

43
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,224
Cinnamon Toast Crunch churros

44
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,504
But I didn't cuz I assume it's

45
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,296
Cinnamon Toast Crunch

46
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,344
I wanted

47
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,928
They have some ice cream treats that are like

48
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,464
Palpable

49
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,584
Another little little ice cream balls in chocolate

50
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,120
Low class

51
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:23,776
I'm sorry is there a box of wine version of

52
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,104
Nestle's crunch

53
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,128
Poppables

54
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:28,896
Valve cores

55
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:34,016
Actually the problem is the moment you said it I was like yes you're right those are the

56
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:39,648
And then there's a classier version

57
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:43,232
That is like I think it's called dream pops or something like that

58
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,792
Maybe a non-dairy situation

59
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:46,816
Disgusting

60
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,864
Look they're both bad

61
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,424
Let's

62
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,008
Interesting at the head

63
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,568
One was slightly less

64
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,592
Right

65
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,616
Reputable suck

66
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,408
Okay

67
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,992
You know I found a churro cones

68
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:09,600
In situations where you're dealing with the subpar snack

69
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:13,696
Usually the snack that really goes for being the most subpar wind-up taste

70
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:20,095
Better remind me also I got in under the wire and got a Choco Taco before

71
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,679
Before the shutdown operation

72
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,727
Victims

73
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,751
Cancel culture

74
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,311
The ultimate cancel culture

75
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,335
Seasons

76
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,615
It was good

77
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:36,991
I will say that I remember being better but I think that's how are almost everything

78
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,783
You're right your taste buds

79
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,551
The Rose

80
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,831
Colored glasses

81
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:45,439
History you look back on these these Novelties of your

82
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,719
And you think like

83
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,767
God was so perfectly nice cream was

84
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:49,535
Just the right

85
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,559
Consistent Trail

86
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:56,703
I'll be almost every time you're going to get one of those the taco itself that the shallow is going to be a little bit

87
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,727
The consistency is

88
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:04,127
Gray wash or tacos are kind of like to squishy middle crunch

89
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,735
Lakeshore

90
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:11,807
Ice creams going to spell out that's almost

91
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,111
Still pretty good better than

92
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,135
Either of the pop-up

93
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,671
That's not hard to do

94
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,695
Deals Gap

95
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:22,303
So why would I

96
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:29,983
Like a dragon enjoying weed we talked earlier about how difficult we've been having a

97
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:36,383
Finding a video game something that simultaneously

98
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,151
0

99
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:41,247
Because it was on sale for like four boxes

100
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:48,927
It was fun but I think both of us found the combat a little bit monotonous

101
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:55,071
It's essentially the same game like all the sense of humor's they're all of the story beats or are very similar.

102
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,863
But there's something about turn bass

103
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:57,887
Jrpg

104
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,911
Geez being

105
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,983
Dropped into modern-day Tokyo that is hilarious

106
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:07,871
It's just very very funny and it's a good game I like it

107
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,687
Okay

108
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:14,015
Will be really a turn-based RPG guy too often are you

109
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:17,599
I think I was the person who told you to try

110
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,623
Three houses

111
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,927
For sure but I mean like

112
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:27,071
This is more like Final Fantasy 10-2 much of that

113
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:30,655
Maybe it's more than

114
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:33,471
I know I don't know

115
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,007
I think I'd enjoy that you might have

116
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:37,823
There we go

117
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,591
Fake

118
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,359
So Jordan

119
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:40,895
Episode

120
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,455
Let's go over this is

121
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:45,247
Unprecedented

122
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,015
But it's rare

123
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:49,855
We're actually going to go back to the past

124
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:52,927
But only like a couple days before our last episode

125
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:57,791
Because I realized that we missed something in terms of the

126
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,095
The catching up to the present

127
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:02,911
So we're going to be talking about August 19th 2020

128
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,679
Me to today

129
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,471
And that is because

130
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,751
This is the day after Brian

131
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:11,615
Shelter got canceled

132
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:15,455
Look I don't think I don't think there's a court like a direct

133
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:17,759
Text correlation cider no you don't know

134
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,831
Correlation

135
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:24,671
They let us on

136
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:28,255
His last episode understand the consequences

137
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:31,327
Cosmically I understand that maybe it wasn't us who got

138
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,095
Filters

139
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:35,423
Specifically

140
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:41,823
Cosmic consequences

141
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,431
Chicago Teachers Union shirt shelter in hot water

142
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:52,575
See I was looking at like some of the stuff that had happened

143
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,111
And over the course of

144
00:07:54,367 --> 00:08:00,511
That they know the time that we'd messed obviously there is the tourniquet fake turning on trumpet

145
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,791
Daughter's death that like

146
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,839
He seems like actually important things

147
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,119
And in that I kind of

148
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:06,911
Just forgot

149
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,447
Feltre Hiddleston

150
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,311
I don't know maybe maybe there's a part of it there's block

151
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:16,639
M block it out of my mind since we were on it

152
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,455
Turn the TV on

153
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,759
No but this is important for Alex

154
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:25,087
This is way more important for Alex

155
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,879
Then anyone other than Brian

156
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,647
And seltzer right

157
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,671
I think it's probably

158
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,231
More important to him than still

159
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,023
Going to get another job somewhere

160
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,351
See how Alex takes

161
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:42,751
The news before we do Jordan that say hello to some doo-wop

162
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:47,871
Or at least she's sorry she fall asleep to this every night

163
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:54,783

189
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,807
Transmission of We the People

190
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:09,439
Interesting Man essentially nothing Alex says about his own show at is accurate there at all

191
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,487
Like I guess embattled

192
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,255
Just means

193
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:15,583
Consequences are mounting for things I've done

194
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:21,983
Yeah you can make an argument that he's teleprompter free but that doesn't mean anything and he has a screen in front of him the producers

195
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:28,383
But messages on he has a board that shows in the collars earpiece that the producers are talking to him through throughout

196
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,151
The show on

197
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:35,551
But he doesn't have a teleprompter that's true but it's not as

198
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,575
Lapeer

199
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:42,975
The show is not uncensored because he can't swear on the radio so by definition he's operating under censorship

200
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:46,559
I couldn't imagine a show that the more filter than this one

201
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:53,215
Just recently with the acknowledgement of trump taking money from Pfizer we saw Crystal Clear example of the sort of filtering

202
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:56,799
Acceptable to be on his show

203
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,847
This is a common thing to like

204
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:03,967
Alex will conveniently pretend to not be aware of certain things about figures he's trying to support

205
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,991
False

206
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:10,879
Slightly out of his good graces he magically knows about all the things that should have been a big problem for him before

207
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:17,791
We saw another glaring example of this with Bill Barr who Alex love but then when he wouldn't back Trump's nonsense at the end of his present

208
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:23,167
Alex suddenly had information about bars families ties to Epstein that never come up before

209
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:27,007
This is filtered and produced

210
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:33,407
It just appears to not be any of those things because Alex is too lazy to prepare so we have to fill his show with pointless

211
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,455
And his imagination is disgusting

212
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,527
Rambling about grotesque topics for long stretches

213
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:45,439
Glad to see I'm rocking out to a little All Along the Watchtower though

214
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:50,047
It's kind of interesting to really go back in time and think about how much of that type of music

215
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,583
Blue people's minds

216
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,863
Right yeah like

217
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,631
Adele

218
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:56,959
Nothing to me like music

219
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:03,359
Way Beyond that I used to I used to think about that quite a bit like the idea of

220
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:08,479
This being played on the radio first times you heard it

221
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:14,879
How could you get you were listening to f****** clog dancing before that and then all the sudden

222
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:21,279
It happened of course you're more than welcome over to Baba O'Riley

223
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:28,703
Fiddle player before this happened and now you're like Aleisha what am I doing in this small town

224
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,543
Oversimplifying things a little bit but yeah that wonder is kind of like

225
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,311
It's team

226
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:38,943
Maybe it's just because it's something that is inaccessible to us and something outside of our life experience

227
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,991
Imagining

228
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,295
You know what it is to it

229
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,831
To desire in a

230
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,111
To go back to a monoculture

231
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,647
Sure

232
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:54,047
It's like everybody was connected by hearing these songs on the radio

233
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:57,119
There was there was this thing that that everybody

234
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:00,703
Was experiencing

235
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,751
Your cohort stagedoor

236
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:08,895
You saying I'm going to throw up more towards like I'm longing for the days whenever a discovery was more like

237
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,175
You know

238
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:14,271
Pythagoras discovered a square + b square you know what it's like holyshit

239
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:17,855
Nobody's going to discover anything for like a thousand years after that you know

240
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:20,159
So with All Along the Watchtower

241
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:24,255
Nobody hurts it like that before you know but whatever Kanye comes out with

242
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,023
Jesus walks

243
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:26,815
Great

244
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,351
Awesome

245
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:31,935
Epoch changing but it's not like back then

246
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:38,591
Because we already had All Along the Watchtower If I Didn't Have Jesus Walks you know I can still listen to that chicken

247
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,127
Have anything

248
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,943
Nothing

249
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,039
Wasted

250
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:54,975
It's it was all just nothing and then Jimi Hendrix Came Upon

251
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,023
And I believe that the

252
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,095
The cover of about that

253
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:02,911
Another version of his phone already

254
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,799
Your your your point make sense

255
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:12,639
Alex is so dumb and boring that we end up

256
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:15,711
Being interested on going down that road

257
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:22,367
News story that I think we'll probably be his main focus

258
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,135
For today

259
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:27,487
Let me just do this let me just get me the main stack headline going to plow through Mall

260
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,535
Yes

261
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,399
They put out a press release yesterday

262
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,191
Podcastone

263
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,471
Pause swabbing others

264
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,799
And I have declared their number one enemy

265
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,079
Infowars

266
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:47,455
110,000

267
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,551
Information Warriors

268
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:56,159
Where we heard that term before the info lawyers

269
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:58,719
The people

270
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,535
I mean

271
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,071
Man

272
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,423
Really scared of us

273
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,447
Not just me

274
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:09,727
What

275
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:12,543
The fact that we've got the Death Star plans

276
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,847
How big big if true

277
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,615
Yesterday

278
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,151
Yeah just press release

279
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,431
A lot of Agents

280
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,455
41 Pressler

281
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,223
That's true

282
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,783
Are they able to find the story that Alex is talking

283
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:29,183
I'm about and it's an article in news punch about the world economic Forum hiring 110,000 people to combat missing for

284
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,207
Information on social media

285
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:37,119
This was a post those published on August 17th 2022 and it's based on a video published by a channel called the people

286
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:37,887
Kohl's voice

287
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:44,543
This is just like a junior varsity has Infowars Channel on YouTube main sources of podcast the world economic forum

288
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:47,615
Featuring the UN communications director Melissa

289
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,383
Fleming

290
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,223
She never mentions Infowars being class Schwab's number one enemy though she

291
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,527
She does discuss efforts they were taking

292
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,575
King to push back against misinformation

293
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,623
The first one she mentions is called

294
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,391
Verified

295
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,439
Which is done with the help of a communication

296
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,975
Confirm and it was an effort

297
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,791
To take solid information and put it into formats Adobe

298
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,839
Easy to share on social media

299
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:13,215
The concern was that so much of the actual information that you could have was buried and inaccessible p

300
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,751
PDFs enlarge documents

301
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,543
Misinformation is packed

302
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,103
Skitzo Sewickley and it's optimized for engagement

303
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:22,687
That's the entire business model for misinformation so that the primary

304
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,455
Concern for them

305
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,247
Where's the folks at the UN where baby

306
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,063
Behind on making the information that was provided good

307
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,599
For posting well I mean there

308
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,135
Fundamental issue is

309
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,671
Is that they're running up against

310
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,719
Learning is hard and chocolate is

311
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,487
Delicious

312
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,767
Yeah yeah

313
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:37,535
Essentially

314
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,583
Another initiative they were launching this called

315
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,143
Pause where they were trying to spread the message that

316
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:42,911
You should stop at

317
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:45,983
Think before reposting something that seems too good to be

318
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:46,751
Be true

319
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:49,567
It excites you so you want to post it but maybe it's b*******

320
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,359
Take a second to think about

321
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:55,199
You still want to share it once that adrenaline wears off go ahead

322
00:17:55,967 --> 00:18:00,831
Apparently the belief is that encouraging the sort of behavior would cut down drastically on nonsense posting

323
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,367
I'm skeptical but

324
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,903
Mansion oh maybe it couldn't hurt

325
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:10,559
She also does say that they've recruited 110,000 information volunteers who are applying these kinds of practices at

326
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,839
Introducing good information

327
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,375
An intern misinformation space

328
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:16,959
I guess I would consider that information Warfare

329
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,751
He's right but I also think it is

330
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:19,775
Defensive in nature

331
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:22,591
All that being said yes was released

332
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,895
In November 2020

333
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:31,295
This is not news article as if it is

334
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:35,135
And because Alex has no idea what he's talking about

335
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,159
Thinks it's news to

336
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,719
Only he'd listen to Fleming's advice about

337
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,511
Before you repost something

338
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:45,375
Ironically maybe he would have gotten the story a little closer to Accurate as possible

339
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,143
Possible

340
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,727
I mean I was wondering

341
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,263
Here's my problem

342
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,287
They're okay

343
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:53,823
Dependa

344
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:57,407
You know with the news punch then came the world economic Forum just

345
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:00,223
Hire 100,000 people the volunteers

346
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,759
No that's what I'm saying

347
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:08,159
That's my big issue with that is like what are you talking about nobody has just the kind of cash

348
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:13,023
Surround at 110,000 let alone the world economic

349
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:16,607
For a bit and I'm willing to bet that a lot of this

350
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,655
Is Fairleigh unofficial

351
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,447
Some of this is just like

352
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,751
People signed some kind of a pledge

353
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:29,407
Some sort of a symbolic pledge percent accurate thank God for that

354
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,479
But I mean Alex is getting a lot of mileage out of this

355
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,015
2 year old

356
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:36,063
Podcast

357
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:36,831
Heard yesterday.

358
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,879
2 years old

359
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,159
Not good

360
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:43,231
So we get to stelter here at Alex's in a mood

361
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,535
We have some celebratory things

362
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,815
Here to make fun of

363
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,263
Brian stelter who already had no viewers so we already at show is already cancelled

364
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,543
If no one's watching

365
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,895
Local radio shows

366
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:05,247
Millions and millions and millions of listeners

367
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,159
How many viewers in its it's

368
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:17,535
Zombie broadcast

369
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,887
I think this is

370
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:22,655
Sad

371
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:27,775
You can't even really muster the energy to dance on filters grave

372
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,311
It said that

373
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:34,175
Yeah but you know what your greatest thing ever

374
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,991
Alright you can't be happy when your nemesis

375
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,527
This is gone because your nemesis

376
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,295
This is what

377
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:42,879
Juice to the heights that you couldn't have reached without said nemesis

378
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,159
That's true

379
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:46,207
It's not a formal anime an anime

380
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,487
Defeat but stelter

381
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,535
Filter was a man among men

382
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,863
We are about to play I want to play a clip a little bit later Alex

383
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,423
Repeatedly yelling at stelter is Anna

384
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,495
So okay well maybe I did my best

385
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:04,895
I get what you're saying though you have more of a bond with arch-nemesis will you have a bond with a t

386
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,991
Well I won't have him to pay

387
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:12,575
Around anymore there's probably disappoint like

388
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:18,720
When Alex doesn't have like a democrat in office or whatever it doesn't have

389
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:22,560
Easy tool

390
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,096
Give me a little bit harder for him

391
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:24,864
M2

392
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:29,984
I do deal with Wolf Blitzer and must be a must be Bittersweet it must be a bitter

393
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,336
Sweet feeling to know that you've perhaps outlived year-old

394
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,384
You're still an old waste

395
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,176
Stickman yourself Drew

396
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:46,368
We're going to get into a little bit of coverage that Alex has about monkey

397
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:51,488
And I'm just going to give a little bit of this is pretty intensely homophobic

398
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,024
And I would I expect

399
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,560
Yeah pretty pretty bad

400
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:58,400
By the way

401
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:03,264
Man having hundreds of sexual partners a month

402
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,176
We want you to go under lockdown we want you to wear masks

403
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:13,504
But we want to continue

404
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,624
You better wear a mask

405
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,208
But

406
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:26,816
These men can get together and give each other too much of diseases dis

407
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,096
Gaston

408
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,376
That's not good

409
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:36,032
Glenn Greenwald and Joe Rogan who look scary water for Alex like that

410
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,824
Kind of messages they're steering people towards

411
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,616
It's because that's pretty pretty cool

412
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,896
Yeah that's great

413
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:47,296
Well it is true that the available information does indicate that man who have sex with men

414
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:51,392
In the cases of monkeypox that have been identified at this point the way Alex is covering this

415
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:56,768
Is unacceptable and is essentially no different than the rhetoric you would have heard him spout in the early days of AIDS

416
00:22:57,024 --> 00:23:00,352
Yep he hasn't intense the same for the lgbtq community

417
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:06,752
But he knows it's unfashionable to just be honest about that so he finds other stories he can use as cover to

418
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:07,520
Expresses hate

419
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:12,128
An important point about this whole dynamic comes up in a CNBC article

420
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:16,480
About 98% of patients Who provided demographic information

421
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:19,296
The Clinic's identified as men who have sex with men according to

422
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,064
To the CDC

423
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:26,208
That's not necessarily saying that 98% of people who have contracted monkeypox are men who have sex with men

424
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:30,560
There may be a percentage of people who sought treatment who did not provide that demographic

425
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,328
Information

426
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,632
That's said it would be slightly dishonest

427
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,912
To say that there's not something

428
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:35,936
Statistically relevant

429
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:40,800
There do appear to be increase rates in the community of gay and bisexual men

430
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:41,568
It's dangerous.

431
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,848
To create this Association

432
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:44,640
And even more dangerous

433
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,664
2 / 10.8

434
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,944
It's just an STD

435
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,736
It's a complicated situation

436
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,272
The people like Alex acting like this

437
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,552
They're going to get innocent people

438
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,088
I am.

439
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:54,624
What he wants

440
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,440
Incidentally there's no call for monkeypox lockdown

441
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:00,512
And in fact the reality is just the opposite of what Alex

442
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,280
The same

443
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:04,608
Tewodros the head of the World Health Organization said this

444
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,632
At the end of last month

445
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:06,656
Quote

446
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,448
Remember who have sex with men

447
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,872
This includes for the moment reducing your number of sexual partners

448
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:22,016
Reconsidering sex with new partners and exchanging contact details of any new partners to enable follow-up if

449
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,320
Alex hates the lgbtq

450
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,624
Kiki community so he makes up here to attack them with

451
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,208
Things they paint him as the victim mmse privileged class

452
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,280
Who the system wouldn't dare even suggest inconveniencing

453
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:39,680
He's pretending that the government is going to force a good people like himself to lockdown over monkeypox but they would even think of suggest

454
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,704
Behavioral advice

455
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,472
The game Madden

456
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:48,128
This is complete b******* because the World Health Organization has a goal to dealing with the outbreak by serving the people who are affected by

457
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,664
To minimize any

458
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,432
Stigma

459
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:52,736
It's going to leave that discrimination

460
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:56,064
Conversely Alex's goalies that discrimination itself

461
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:01,440
So furthering that goal is not best served by dealing with what the World Health Organization is actually doing

462
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:04,256
Fake storyline that conforms

463
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,536
Do your persecution complex

464
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,072
And it's complete

465
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,680
Yeah

466
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:13,472
Yeah I mean

467
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:14,496
First off

468
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,592
Only Wilt Chamberlain is headhunter

469
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,360
Did the partners in a

470
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,152
Let's start bright

471
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:25,248
Even if you want to take that and ground it a little bit

472
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,344
Close contact that can spread monkey

473
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,112
Gearbox

474
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,904
Is that something you need 100 partners

475
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,696
Absolute

476
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:37,280
You can have you could go on a date with somebody and have a great time

477
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,328
Even used condoms

478
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,352
Conceivably

479
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,400
And still

480
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,936
They contracted from

481
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:50,336
Skin-to-skin contact or eating is what happens whenever you have

482
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:53,408
Community that is isolated due to ship

483
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,992
Any disease breaks out in an isolated community

484
00:25:57,504 --> 00:26:03,136
It is going to break out of that Community eventually but as it stands right now the only reason that it's

485
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:07,488
Stuck there is because of a discrimination that's already inherent in the f****** sister

486
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,560
Like this is a self-made creation

487
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:11,840
Again

488
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:12,608
Always

489
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,144
Yeah frustrate

490
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,008
There's a there's also a self-fulfilling this that Alex's

491
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,032
Kind of working

492
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,872
The night is that his actions

493
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:28,224
And a lot of the rhetoric that he's putting out either you would do

494
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:34,112
If you wanted the disease to spread for at the beginning he must have been paid for

495
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,136
Baikoko

496
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:41,536
I mean it that's the only explanation is that he was working Florida when we are subsidized by covid

497
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:45,120
Is is it possible for a virus to like

498
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:50,496
Congeal together a personality long enough to pay Alex 50 million dollars in order to spread itself

499
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:54,848
I don't think so but it is it is possible that's what's happening

500
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,152
It's worse even

501
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:59,456
Let's say about that's great

502
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,016
Absolutely disgusting

503
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,320
Sexual

504
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,088
Homosexual

505
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,888
Lick toilet bowls at the airport

506
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:21,728
Or you're going to go to a grocery store without a mask

507
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,800
Spit on people

508
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,360
Because he's gay

509
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:38,368
Because what you're doing

510
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,648
Keep doing it

511
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:47,328
Reality

512
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:51,936
Liberal

513
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:55,520
All about they can do whatever they want

514
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:58,336
We got to just put up with this

515
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,128
So yeah Rogan

516
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,944
How you feel about Alex

517
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,480
Suggesting that

518
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:08,320
There's a connection between being gay and raping dogs

519
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,112
Motherfuker

520
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,392
Haha

521
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,160
Years

522
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,952
Multiple years

523
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:18,048
Bitched and whined about having to wear a mask

524
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:18,816
To stop

525
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:19,840
Spreading disease

526
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:23,424
And now they're going to wring their hands at all my God

527
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:29,824
Someone spreading disease doing something I don't like instead of going into random stranger's home and spitting all over there

528
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,152
Coughing in front of somebody in Atlanta airport had an abortion

529
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,944
Play all of this s***

530
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,016
They are disease-ridden horror monsters

531
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:40,320
And they're going to come at me with this b*******

532
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:41,856
That's very

533
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:42,624
It is

534
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,256
It's very frustrating I'm more frustrated by the

535
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:52,608
Aggressive

536
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:53,376
Buddy buddies Express

00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,240
Awful

540
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,520
F****** awful

541
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,288
It is

542
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,872
Alex

543
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:04,640
It's you

00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,768
Warriors

549
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,960
How old are you

550
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,264
As the army of Infowars

551
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:35,104
Information Warfare

552
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:39,456
How do you understand

553
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:44,064
If I were doing because

554
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,856
I don't want to be the best in the

555
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,648
That good

556
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,464
L

557
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:53,792
Bolsonaro

558
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:57,632
But you know what the enemy

559
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:02,240
As the number one anime

560
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:04,288
I told you 20 years ago

561
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:09,664
Oh my God

562
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,880
God showed me the future

563
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,928
You ready for this

564
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,560
Floating

565
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,352
Oh yes I accept the mission

566
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:39,360
Commissioned by God for this war

567
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:42,688
Wow yeah I know this seems like somebody who's like

568
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,224
So much

569
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:46,784
More reliable than the mainstream media

570
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:50,368
Yeah this is a guy who you go to

571
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,648
To cut through the b*******

572
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,000
I mean Jake and Elwood Blues were busy

573
00:30:56,256 --> 00:31:02,400
So God had to commission a different a****** for this job

574
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:06,752
Saving a bunch of children

575
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:10,592
Orphanage doing a concert

576
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,408
I think it's fine

577
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:22,624
This is a little bit different maybe a little bit

578
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:26,464
So look out this podcast

579
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,584
Did he didn't yesterday play Warriors ago

580
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,864
Explain to you why

581
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:34,400
Here we are

582
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:36,704
The New World Order

583
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:40,544
Well the world economic Forum which is the mouth of the new world order the mouth

584
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,872
The mouthless lame-ass

585
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,712
Spokesperson

586
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,248
For evil

587
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,296
Has come out and said that

588
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,832
World

589
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,624
Continual

590
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,672
Enforced injection failed

591
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,768
There's a total rejection

592
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,560
Across-the-board

593
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:05,888
Billions of rotting poison

594
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:08,192
MRNA gene therapy

595
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:10,752
Sure

596
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,824
Is a declaration

597
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,104
Of War

598
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:15,872
Next

599
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,152
Mobile

600
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:18,688
Censorship

601
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,992
With 100,000

602
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,808
Volunteers

603
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,856
Inside media

604
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,136
An army of

605
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:29,440
Brian stelter Humpty Dumpty

606
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:30,464
Pennywise

607
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,000
Brian stelter

608
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,560
So filter Humpty Dumpty

609
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,328
Pennywise's

610
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:37,632
Is a barrage of imagery

611
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:41,216
Brings up something that I want to stress for a second

612
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:45,568
A lot is made of how Alex's make stuff up all the time

613
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,848
And rightfully so

614
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:47,872
Uber Eats

615
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:51,968
Peter recognize that he does more than just make up details and lie about concrete

616
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:56,064
He also writes stories out of these fake facts

617
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,344
That are necessary to

618
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,904
Explain them within the context of his made-up world

619
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:06,816
Winston's here Alex has this headline that he's done zero investigation into that he's presenting as the world economic

620
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,608
Form declaring war on Infowars

621
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,656
They hiring 110,000

622
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,424
Information Volvo

623
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,448
Want to use the counter missing

624
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,216
Information

625
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:17,568
In order to bolster the story he needs to connected to some of his larger storyline

626
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:20,128
In order to embellish the story

627
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:22,944
Alex says that the world economic forum is doing this

628
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,992
Because there's so many shots

629
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,016
But no one wants to

630
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:29,088
Taking all the anti-vax people are winning the war of ideas

631
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,136
So they enlisted in the Army too

632
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:33,184
Crush anti-vax voices like out

633
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:39,072
This is running a disinformation campaign against a campaign meant to fight misinformation

634
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,144
What is really don't like fact checker

635
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,680
Yeah I mean why would you not

636
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:50,080
What's critical here is it Alex's making up of the wife or the story out of thin air

637
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:52,384
He's got a piece of information

638
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,688
110,000 volunteers thing

639
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:59,040
But he has literally no other details about this story so he's just making it up

640
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:05,440
He doesn't realize this was a story from November 2020 before any of the vaccines or even available which is

641
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,208
Kind of sad

642
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,280
In order to make sense of why the world economic Forum would be

643
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,048
Be doing this

644
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:12,352
The present-day as Alex thinks they are

645
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:18,240
He just falls back on what version of this story would be most emotionally satisfying for himself and the audio

646
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:25,152
That's why the rationale for their alleged action is that Alex's side is too successful and they have all these expiring vex

647
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:26,432
Seems that no one wants

648
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:33,344
This explanation is a fiction that creates a sense of victory for the listeners and more importantly it frames their online

649
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,880
Activity is a critical part of the

650
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:37,184
Fight against the world economic forum

651
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,720
Information volunteers

652
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:44,608
Promoting Alex's contact isn't just about getting new people into his revenue streams and selling his dumb pills

653
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,400
Actually fighting back

654
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:50,752
Sam's Club Schwab cyber Army who would be enlisted because you all were

655
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:51,776
You're too powerful

656
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:53,312
With your previous posting

657
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,592
Alex's content

658
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:59,712
Really well for Alex on a couple of runs but it's completely made up

659
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,064
The simple detail the podcast but this is the basis that the basis for the

660
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,880
This entire story came out in November 2020 review

661
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:09,440
Old to just be s*** that Alex is making up to

662
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,720
Stroke is oneco

663
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:14,304
I'm convinced the listeners to continue working as his unpaid social media

664
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:20,704
Wild yeah I mean it is it is a little bit like somebody took a ren-faire too far

665
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:23,264
And it's just now his full life

666
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,568
You know just everyday is the Ren Faire

667
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:28,896
And whenever something like if somebody brings a

668
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:32,992
Phone in there they got to retcon the entire Ren Faire

669
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:35,296
To make sense of the phone being inside

670
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:38,880
And then every time you add a new thing now we're in a cyberpunk

671
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:44,000
Ren-faire it so now we've got God over there like it's just a bigger and bigger unfair

672
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,536
I was not listening

673
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,816
To you because I started

674
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,608
Think about Renfield rent

675
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,168
What would that look like

676
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,960
Maura Ren Faire

677
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:57,568
Enfield Ren Faire Brookfield

678
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:03,968
Regulate

679
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:09,088
I got distracted by wordplay

680
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:12,416
Hear Alex play the clip of that podcast

681
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,440
Start again

682
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,208

00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,456
Short clip of the

00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,016
The wef spokesperson just

00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:44,160

692
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,184
Also

693
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,280
Recruiting people around the world and so far we've recruited 100

694
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,048

695
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:50,816

696
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,096
Information

697
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,120
Volunteers

698
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:55,424
This is all I mean it's just an elaborate

699
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,448
Fiction based on

700
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,472
Alex

701
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:58,496
Looking into

702
00:36:58,752 --> 00:36:59,520
To the story that he's telling

703
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:00,288
Yeah

704
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:06,944
It's sad that we have any follow-up on these volunteers like it whenever she announces we got 110,000 vets

705
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:09,504
10000 people signed up did anybody actually

706
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,112
Do f*** off know but I know we didn't solve disinformation in the past 2 years

707
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:20,512
But I did see a recent thread on the conspiracy subreddit the people were like

708
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:24,096
Oh that explains all the shoes commented recently

709
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,632
Recently

710
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:30,752
Because they didn't look into it either course not they just saw this newspunch article that I got time

711
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:34,080
The date on the article is recent so

712
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,360
All the shells

713
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:41,760
When will the chills stop Shilling dad it relieved also brings it to Sharp

714
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:43,552
Focus the idea of what a joke

715
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:45,856
Notion of

716
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:46,880
Critical thinking

717
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,440
In conspiracy and like

718
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:51,488
Alex Jones e communities are

719
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,560
What did you did any of these did any of these folks

720
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:56,608
And their great leader Alex

721
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,400
Stop to ask themselves what

722
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,424
The context of this

723
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:03,008
Is there is there an actual story here what no

724
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:04,544
It's convenient

725
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,336
What you want

726
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:11,712
Tip to say you will not only accepted as real Andrew and current

727
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:15,552
You'll embellishing makeup details about it to make it even more perfect

729
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:17,344
For your ego

730
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,624
I do appreciate

731
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,744
Anybody who gets an instant and a piece of information and then instantly is like

732
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,072
Well that explains this other thing that it doesn't have anything to do

733
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:29,888
Because there's nothing in between

734
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,216
You think there would be something in between but now you're just like that

735
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:34,240
That explains back

736
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:37,056
My world make sense

737
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:39,360
So Alex is mad at Sam Harris

738
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,272
Because if you want to talk about a Rosetta Stone

739
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:54,464
If you want to talk about something that really illustrates who we're up against and there

740
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:56,768
Hubris

741
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:00,096
Smugness

742
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,656
Bravado

743
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:06,240
You are wasting

744
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:10,080
Supposed

745
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:12,128
Dark web intellectual leftist

746
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,088
Course we censor conservatives conspiracy

747
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,648
Prompto dangerous

748
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:30,048
Sam Harris is in charge of all Media or whatever I don't I don't really care

749
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,888
But one of the things that Sam Harris was talking about was that

750
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:35,168
The corruption

751
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:36,448
That it got

752
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,984
You can find with vitamin

753
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,776
Hunter Biden share

754
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:41,824
It doesn't come anywhere close to what Trump

755
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:44,128
Is involved so

756
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:47,200
These kinds of arguments about the corruption in the

757
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,224
Concerns about it

758
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:49,248
Our kind of

759
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:55,648
Weird and dumb one of the things he brings up his Trump University and Jean to that

760
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:57,952
Sure thing really quick

761
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,304
According to Ali

762
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:04,608
Alex is worldview

763
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:06,400
The crimes of the bidens

764
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:08,704
Are much greater than Trump

765
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,496
Of course in the real world

766
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:11,520
Well

767
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,288
Not really

768
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:14,848
So much so is Alex's comparing Trump

769
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:15,872
University

770
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:18,688
What's the fake

771
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:20,992
Imaginary version of Ida

772
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,272
Then

773
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:24,064
Yes Trump University not that bad

774
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,112
In the real world

775
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,648
Trump looks pretty shity

776
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:34,048
He does and that's kind of the the detention does it play in this clip

777
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:40,448
Shity like shady Delaware s*** that he's been doing for the whole time Lego credit card companies don't have to pay Bubba

778
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,264
That's corrupt I get it but that still isn't

779
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,312
I got nuclear Secret side my house

780
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:49,152
Yeah I'm not a little different I'm not saying anything to like

781
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:52,480
Get let Biden off the hook for any corrupt

782
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:53,760
I'm just saying that he didn't

783
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:59,648
Kill kids in a basement in this clip

784
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:01,184
Gets really defensive about how we didn't go to

785
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:09,632
Nothing but you can do

786
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:16,032
The basement is of children

787
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:17,824
Compromised by foreign powers

788
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,896
Trump University

789
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:30,624
Weekends with Trump and top experts

790
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,416
Brainstorming and

791
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,352
High School

792
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,680
I went and got a job selling memberships

793
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,592
At a gym

794
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,687
$100,000 a year

795
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:55,711
When I was 9

796
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:56,479
19

797
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:59,551
Sports car

798
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,831
Nice two-bedroom

799
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,623
I was having the time of my life

800
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,159
Top dollar

801
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:07,487
3 years ago

802
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,303
Dolartoday

803
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:15,423
I was nineteen years old making a hundred plus thousand dollars a year

804
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:17,215
Working 4 hours a day

805
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,383
And I look good

806
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:26,943
And people bought the membership especially the women

807
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:28,991
Is that

808
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,527
A few times a day

809
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:31,295
40

810
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:33,855
I love herself Punjab

811
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:35,135
The point is

812
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:35,903
What is that

813
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,767
What is a happening

814
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:44,351
That that was a real value

815
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,703
That experience was real I should have paid to be a Salesman

816
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:50,239
Club

817
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:52,031
I mean

818
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:54,079
One of the hottest jams and also the time

819
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:56,639
Ensure

820
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:03,295
Memberships business about Sam Harris remember

821
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:09,183
Loser no

822
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:14,815
But that doesn't even matter

823
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:21,471
What are you getting at

824
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:24,543
Real Smogon

825
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:26,335
Nnnnn say yeah

826
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:27,615
You know

827
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:31,455
The number one evil of trump is his Trump University

828
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:34,015
As you're probably sitting in a chair

829
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:36,575
Happening

830
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:39,647
Alex's I mean luck II

831
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:40,671
I think

832
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,439
Vets

833
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:46,559
Fairly important to recognize that not everybody does need to go to college

834
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:47,583
Higher education

835
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:48,351
That's fantastic

836
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:50,655
I'm a big proponent of it but I don't think

837
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:51,935
That people should

838
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:57,311
Ashamed for not going to college at 9

839
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:59,359
The people learning a trade is

840
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,383
Is pretty fantastic

841
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,663
A lot of people find

842
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:02,943
A great deal of happiness

843
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,271
Great

844
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:09,855
So I just want to put that to the side just because I don't want to be like

845
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:10,879
Shiting on Alex

846
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,159
You're not going

847
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:13,183
College ranking

848
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,975
But he really is

849
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:16,511
I like insecure

850
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:17,535
Oh yeah

851
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:21,631
Very much what being expressed here is very much a feeling of

852
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:24,959
Why does everyone think he's so smart

853
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:31,359
I mean it is I mean maybe because he doesn't go into

854
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:34,175
Chit like his monkeypox nonsense

855
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:35,199
Right inlets

856
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,735
Before we go any further

857
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:39,551
Alright let's start with the easy smart thing to do

858
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:45,951
Don't defend Trump University lawsuit you don't even have to just say that sucks I have another smart

859
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:46,719
Things you could do

860
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:47,487
Not talk

861
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:53,887
Constantly about Visions from God

862
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:59,775
Defending Trump University is free that's true no downside to not defending University

863
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:03,615
There is a downside to defending Trump University which is where you go onto this

864
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:07,967
Weird tangent about how you f*** good when you were in when you work today

865
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:09,759
A club that's it

866
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:11,551
I also think

867
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:15,647
That maybe could use some examining on Alex's part

868
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:17,695
Is how he never stopped being a sales

869
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:28,959
Journalist or anything like that he is still just a Salesman

870
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:30,239
Dumbbells

871
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,007
Song is this

872
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,543
Vuori

873
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:34,847
That's really

874
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:36,383
Primary product

875
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:41,247
Yeah he sells you the worldview you internalized that worldview and it creates needs

876
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:43,295
Vicky can fill for you

877
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,367
There is a cult

878
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:54,303
Nothing that somebody would find unfamiliar if they just listen to like a whole richdadpoordad series and then watch.

879
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:56,095
Alex Jones Excel said maybe like

880
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:57,631
Oh yeah I know I didn't

881
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:59,167
Are you going to drop University

882
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:04,287
Actually I think you would get you don't get sales Gildan Trump University you get sold

883
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,567
You get caught

884
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:06,847
Sue stelter got cancer

885
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:13,503
Let's spend some time

886
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:14,527
Bryan Stow

887
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:19,647
Is a joke

888
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:22,207
But he had 100,000 viewers

889
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:24,511
For cable news that's not even a pulse

890
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,071
I got you was good

891
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,471
Fishes

892
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:35,007
Self

893
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:36,799
Serving arrogant

894
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,383
He was the most

895
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,663
Mug

896
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:44,991
Shemagh

897
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:46,783
Lake pomposity

898
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:55,487
And something million dollars

899
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,535
Plus it

900
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,095
What's the number

901
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:07,519
So there's a lot of theories about exactly why stelter and reliable sources got canceled

902
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:09,567
Precise reasons are but I think everyone is

903
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:10,847
Pretty comfortable with the idea that it's

904
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:14,175
Part of the aftermath of the Warner Brothers Discovery merger

905
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:15,967
That was finalized back in

906
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:20,319
Also it's a consummate throughout their properties like hbomax

907
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:26,719
And this is actually part of a larger story about big corporate Media consolidation but Alex is completely missing the

908
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:27,743
For the trees

909
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:30,303
He hates Brian stelter and the story he wants

910
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:35,167
So tell about this is It's tell there's a failure who got fired cuz nobody liked him and it showed no viewers

911
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:38,239
That's a story that's emotionally satisfying for Alex

912
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:39,775
And it's what the listeners Waunakee

913
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:46,431
The story doesn't matter cuz they use the tip of the spear he's the king of big Tech and media

914
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,711
Watchdog

915
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:48,991
Missing this entire life

916
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:50,015
What a great

917
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:51,551
Time for somebody like Alec

918
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:55,647
Text to like really dig into what happens whenever media is

919
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:57,439
Is monopolized and how

920
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:59,231
Powers-that-be

921
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:00,255
Whenever they be

922
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:02,815
Become a smaller group in a smaller number

923
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:06,911
All of them with control over the media a number of

924
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:07,935
Companies let's say

925
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:08,959
Smaller than 10

926
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:13,055
You know and those companies have CEOs and they all meet in back rooms

927
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:15,871
And they control the media literally

928
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:18,943
It would be a great time for somebody who is the conspiracy theorist

929
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:19,711
To talk about that

930
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:25,599
Well I think you're sounding a little bit I think that

931
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:31,999
There is a real wonderful opportunity for Alex here to rise above his

932
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:34,815
His enemies as it worth

933
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:37,119
Angie could instead of talk

934
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:38,143
What about seltzer

935
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:44,799
Put that aside cuz everyone knows he already doesn't like him at all desolated that be redundant for him just to do a little dance

936
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:46,591
Be like look

937
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:52,991
They're the sure we can all be happy about that but there's a bigger picture here and also it's actually a bad sign

938
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:54,783
Brian stelter

939
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,319
Got to show acts

940
00:48:57,087 --> 00:49:02,975
It's a bad sign that hbomax has no streamlining and laying off all these people

941
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:04,767
Part of a

942
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:06,303
I love them

943
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:08,863
I know who's all coming together

944
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:12,191
That the story plays though you know that like

945
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:13,983
I would I would die today

946
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:17,055
Defend your I don't agree with what you say brister stelter

947
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:21,151
But I would die for your right to not be owned by one conglomerate

948
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:24,991
I demand that this man my mortal enemy

949
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:27,295
Be freed from his prison

950
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,575
Of corporate lock

951
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:30,111
That's there that's

952
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:30,879
That message

953
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:37,279
Plays everybody loves that s*** and it would be an impressive thing for Alex surprise

954
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:42,655
Mister stelter

955
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:50,335
The spirit guided me while you were

956
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:51,359
So eloquent

957
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:52,127
Some clips

958
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:54,431
Here here's an older clip

959
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:57,503
Love stelter that Brian event to Alec

960
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:59,295
We're doing this is your life

961
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:01,855
Not really I was just thinks there's a few that are like

962
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:03,903
These are Great Clips a Celtic

963
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:04,927
I think there's one

964
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:08,255
Okay so let's play the late great

965
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:10,047
The weather channel meteorologist

966
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:15,935
First let me bringing John Coleman he's in San Diego this morning

967
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:17,215
Thank you for being here

968
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:22,335
Tries to be on CNN hello to all your viewers are you busy

969
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:23,103
Denier

970
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,383
That is a word

971
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:28,991
And I want to make

972
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:34,623
I am he's the CEO of The Weather Channel now

973
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,671
The Weather Channel

974
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:43,071
The co-founder

975
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:47,423
Taking a very strong position

976
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:49,215
On global warming that is

977
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:53,567
Where is no consensus in science

978
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:56,127
Science is about

979
00:50:58,687 --> 00:50:59,199
Kohl's back

980
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:06,111
There is no

981
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:13,535
In the future

982
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:15,327
There's a whole lot of baloney

983
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:24,799
The scientific

984
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:30,687
Conclusion

985
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:33,503
What I was when you see that

986
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:35,039
CNN

987
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:40,415
Hello everybody

988
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:47,071
Oh my bedroom

989
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:53,471
That clip actually kind of refute a lot of Alex's Boynton.

990
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:58,591
Mainstream media voices that descent with them on the air Dan

991
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:02,431
Right I mean it's actually one of the worst Clips Alex could have chosen

992
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:08,831
Play I know it's fun to hear someone be rude to tell her I guess that appeals to Alex in some way but it's actually

993
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:13,951
So counter to the the Eevee perception of media

994
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:14,719
Is essential

995
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:17,023
Who sell Infowars as the alternative

996
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:19,071
I mean he's literally saying

997
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:25,727
Thank you for letting me get my message across on the mainstream media and still there's being polite to this guy who's being a

998
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:28,543
Yeah and I can you

999
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:30,335
Imagine big reverse

1000
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:31,359
Like stelter

1001
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:34,687
Coming on Alex's showing being a dick to him and Alex being polite

1002
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:37,503
You know I can't imagine that

1003
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:43,903
No more famous nothing but a hostile platform to somebody who

1004
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:46,463
Agrees with the media

1005
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:47,999
Forbetterforworse

1006
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:50,303
Often does have a

1007
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:56,959
Deferential adjustable platform maybe not

1008
00:52:57,215 --> 00:53:00,031
Is vigorous debate as Alex would like which is

1009
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:03,615
Damita translates people screaming at each other and saying disgusting s***

1010
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:06,687
Call pedophiles and what have you

1011
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:07,711
TV day

1012
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:09,503
But I mean

1013
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:14,111
Maybe told him to the different clip

1014
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:15,647
I think this hurt you or argue

1015
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:17,183
Yeah I mean it does

1016
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:18,463
Help shelter

1017
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:23,583
I think that's a fairly good clip to play for everybody to look at the media and

1018
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,351
Just go like

1019
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:27,167
We're not doing a good job whatever it is that is

1020
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:28,191
That's not good

1021
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:30,751
Certainly questions

1022
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:31,775
Like

1023
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:32,799
How did

1024
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:39,967
Did you have any reason to suspect this is how Coleman was going to ask so maybe could have

1025
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:41,503
Prepared to

1026
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:43,551
Field him being a dick

1027
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:45,087
You got a mute button

1028
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:47,903
Anyway Alex

1029
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:51,487
Instead of really celebrating stelter

1030
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:54,047
He decides he's going to play

1031
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:57,375
Some old clips he's reminiscing about his enemy

1032
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:59,935
Kind of but also about

1033
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:02,239
How much you yelled at smelter

1034
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:05,055
Navel gazing reminiscing

1035
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:05,823
Check

1036
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:08,127
Brian stelter there it is oh my

1037
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:11,455
Movie cover

1038
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:15,807
You're looking at it the clown I mean would you let your children

1039
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,367
Anywhere near that it

1040
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:20,927
Right there

1041
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:28,095
Stranger danger

1042
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:33,471
I am your enemy

1043
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:35,007
I would literally

1044
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:55,999
Spirit

1045
00:54:57,791 --> 00:55:00,607
Tried to jump photos like sistalook disingenuous

1046
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:03,935
Pull it off

1047
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:13,151
Oh my gosh

1048
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:14,687
Hell on Earth

1049
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:19,551
He wants to run your life he wants to control every aspect of your life

1050
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:25,439
Human

1051
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:26,207
Crash

1052
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:31,071
Electric

1053
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:36,191
Literal

1054
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:37,727
Demon spawn

1055
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:39,775
Okay I'll look at it

1056
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:40,543
And you know what

1057
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:43,103
Better than you if you keep letting it run your life

1058
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:46,431
He went to school ski runs the bank

1059
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:51,039
Smiling

1060
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:57,951
.

1061
00:55:59,231 --> 00:55:59,743
Fun

1062
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:00,767
I like her music

1063
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:02,303
Look in the background

1064
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:08,703
Alex is older

1065
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:12,031
The end of the show today

1066
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:14,847
Thankfully there are these old clips of him putting a little

1067
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:17,407
Gaston into his stelter hate

1068
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:23,551
But this actually is a curious clip to play on the day after stelter shows been canceled that he's out at Siena

1069
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:29,695
That's because of anything I was saying meant anything that it shouldn't have been so simple to remove him from his perch

1070
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:31,999
This filters of the globalist

1071
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:33,535
Platz if you can just be fired

1072
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:39,935
Honestly knowing that stelter was just asked over business considerations and it didn't cause widespread chaos

1073
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:41,215
Chaos among the global

1074
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:43,775
Who makes this entire presentation

1075
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:45,311
Seem pretty stupid

1076
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:51,455
It seems so weird to hear how works up Alex was about stelter these clips now they were on the other side because now that

1077
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:52,735
Shelter is out

1078
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:59,135
Just seems like a worked up baby who is so mad that someone is criticizing him that he decided to make up a bunch of stuff about

1079
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:01,183
Being Central to the globalist plans

1080
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,999
I like this isn't even the full rent it goes on

1081
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:06,047
Ingenuity

1082
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:18,847
You will pay

1083
00:57:53,919 --> 00:58:00,063
Sally's

1084
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:03,647
Get yourself together gun

1085
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:05,951
Suzanne illustrative moment

1086
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:10,303
Alex has any connection to reality

1087
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:11,839
It's just Alex trying to put

1088
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:13,887
Some kind of an elevated appearance onto his

1089
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:14,911
Petulant anger

1090
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:21,567
He knows well enough that if he got on his show and started yelling and lashing out about how he doesn't like people being critical of him his

1091
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:24,639
Elysium is the week child he is inside

1092
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:28,735
I'm asking that immature insecurity with over-the-top pronouncements about

1093
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:29,503
Stelter

1094
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:32,319
Probably being a pedophile and how he's a betrayer

1095
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:38,463
Never that means Alex is able to protect himself from being seen for what he is which is a hypersensitive loser

1096
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:42,559
The issue is that the audience doesn't really realize that they're just watching Ali

1097
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:48,959
Let's play out-of-cycle drama about his own hurt

1098
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:49,727
Feelings

1099
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:51,263
They form opinions

1100
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:55,103
Postings on social media and even harassed Elder over things that Alex says

1101
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:59,199
As if there was anything behind it other than Alex being a baby with a boo-boo

1102
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:03,295
Anyway I probably would have played a different clip on this episode

1103
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:09,951
Symptoms for traced Elders I'm kind of a big high-level big bad guy the day after his show ended with no real pushback or fan

1104
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:15,071
Victory if anything Alex was saying that anything

1105
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:17,119
And this is kind of a grandiose

1106
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:27,871
Here's the problem when you choose your

1107
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:29,151
As you know to be

1108
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:32,223
That did not demonic Realm

1109
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:33,247
You know

1110
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:37,343
Like you think TV is a great choice cuz it's so big and it's so you do like all its

1111
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:39,391
TV but it's really not that big

1112
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:41,183
As it's not as big as you might think

1113
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:42,463
Cuz you can just get by

1114
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:43,231
You can't

1115
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:44,255
Claimed that the

1116
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:45,023
If you

1117
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:49,887
Didn't get the job at a Denny's you can't claim that the manager is the Antichrist

1118
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:53,215
Cuz eventually he's just not going to be the manager anymore

1119
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:56,799
The manager can't be the manager is like the shift

1120
00:59:57,055 --> 01:00:01,919
Supervisor might even

1121
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:05,247
I used to work at a Dairy Queen

1122
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:08,575
When I was like 15 about the burger guy

1123
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:10,879
Is a Satanist

1124
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:13,439
Well yeah that's great so

1125
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:16,767
Counterpoint

1126
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:21,631
Now you brought that piece of information to light I do retractor

1127
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:22,399
Take that

1128
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:29,311
So Alex just play that old stelter needs feeling good about it

1129
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:30,591
You got up asking your work

1130
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:33,919
No it reminded me of that time that you remember Hannibal's

1131
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:35,711
Betway played his own joke

1132
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:40,831
I Just Vibe with it has reminded me about quite a bit

1133
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:44,415
Alex

1134
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:52,095
That is shown in the newsrooms for years

1135
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:54,655
As

1136
01:00:59,263 --> 01:00:59,775
Adult

1137
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:03,615
That is required viewing at least once a week

1138
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:10,527
Cold turkey

1139
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:12,063
Brainwashing

1140
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:14,111
I made it honestly I don't believe it

1141
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:15,135
It's true but if it is

1142
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:18,719
Or

1143
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:19,999
They're laughing at him

1144
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:26,399
Yeah I mean I think I feel like as far as like ways to end your 5 on a Friday you know instead of

1145
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:30,495
Doing the whistle you just start playing that clip and you're not if you're going to leave with a bit of a smile

1146
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:40,479
Alright I think I can go get drinks out really funny to you because you haven't heard

1147
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:43,039
Long time

1148
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:47,903
Really annoying you know I don't think you watch it every week but you play it over the PA

1149
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:49,695
All of

1150
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:52,255
Tucker's employees have to watch this once a week so they can

1151
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:53,023
You keep their head in

1152
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:53,791
The game

1153
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:57,631
Sure can understand what it's like to watch me

1154
01:01:57,887 --> 01:02:04,031
Fake being nauseous looking at Smelter Demon

1155
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:06,079
Key grip do I really need to yes

1156
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:07,615
No but I mean all

1157
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:08,639
Singer contract

1158
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:09,663
Dammit

1159
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:10,431
Hate the show

1160
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:11,199
Yep

1161
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:18,111
Hannity's people after watching once a month that's why they're not so hard for

1162
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:22,975
Caller calls in and wants to know how Alex

1163
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:24,511
The time to read so much

1164
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:26,303
This is a bummer

1165
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:29,631
I want to say I'm very excited when your new book comes out

1166
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:31,423
Out of the end of the month now I admit

1167
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:33,215
But I normally read

1168
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:34,239
Candlebox

1169
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:36,031
Hylian

1170
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:37,055
Addicted to the internet

1171
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:40,895
How many of us are

1172
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:43,455
I can't wait to read

1173
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:46,015
Have an epiphany that

1174
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:49,855
Informational admit I'm in a trance

1175
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:51,135
Ovolo attention

1176
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:52,927
Now you read so much

1177
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:56,255
How much information I would love

1178
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:58,303
If you could share with me and the audience

1179
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:00,607
Are you fine so much time to read

1180
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:03,167
Suggestions on how we can use the internet

1181
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:03,935
That use our self

1182
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:07,007
In a way that promotes enlightenment

1183
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:08,287
Also way to promote

1184
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:09,055
What's a long-term

1185
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:13,151
Do you get Siri or however you recommend

1186
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:13,919
2

1187
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:18,527
Take the time to read entire books

1188
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:19,295
Do we have a

1189
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:20,319
Free Sunday

1190
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:22,879
Get away from the internet how do you recommend kids

1191
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:24,671
Strong party information War

1192
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:26,207
Manage information

1193
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:38,751
Have the same programs over and over again so once you know their operation

1194
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:42,335
You just see the same permutation of it over and over again so that's not hard

1195
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:46,687
Only a few dozen things.

1196
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:48,479
There's only a few dozen plays

1197
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:56,415
So this reminds me of a conversation I had with a comic years ago who was really proud of their ability to do crowd work

1198
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,951
Didn't respond to hecklers

1199
01:03:58,207 --> 01:04:00,767
In reality they weren't that good but they were very confident

1200
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:05,375
A few possible types of responses you need to be ready to hatch

1201
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:11,263
You can respond to something with an angry / meme retort a nice retort or a confused

1202
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:17,407
As long as you had one of each of these in your pocket ready to go you could respond to just about anything an audience

1203
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:23,807
Can proactively rock-paper-scissors theory of stand-up comedy

1204
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:28,415
Is taking the act of responding in the moment on stage and reducing it to a parlor trick

1205
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:31,999
You're creating the illusion of being in the moment and fast on your feet

1206
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:38,655
You're faking being clever because you know that you weren't clever enough to be it for real and you're terrified of being seen

1207
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:39,679
You guys not clever

1208
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:42,751
And getting caught in the moment of being like

1209
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:46,335
This is kind of what Alex is doing with his globalist Playbook idea

1210
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:49,919
He's constructed a couple of stock responses to world events

1211
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:50,943
That he's decided

1212
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:56,831
Call The globalist Playbook and it's basically just his crotch so he never asked to appear like he doesn't know what's going on

1213
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:00,415
Think of a tragic event has the equivalent of someone heckling

1214
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:03,231
In terms of how to interpret Alex's show and the narrative

1215
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:08,095
He needs to be able to respond to it quickly or else he'll risk showing week

1216
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:09,119
Cast of the audience

1217
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:12,447
Comic I knew Alex's pre-loaded response

1218
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:13,215
Has to stop

1219
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:15,775
Instead of angry nicer confused retort

1220
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:17,055
Alex has things like

1221
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:19,871
False flag it was secretly antifa or

1222
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:20,639
Elaborate

1223
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:21,663
State Plata

1224
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:25,759
These are go to responses he can whip out to apply to any situation

1225
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:28,319
Play Mika then rationalize based on

1226
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:31,647
Some detailed be like oh this is part of that Global display

1227
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:32,671
Means nothing

1228
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:35,999
Alex has nothing to say she hasn't read anything

1229
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:42,655
It's pretty telling that this guy asked this question and now it's his first response isn't that he reads all day everyday because

1230
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:44,191
He would know that that silly

1231
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:50,335
His response is just that he knows everything already so we can see things happening in the world then make stories up about them

1232
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:55,711
Considering his track record of being super wrong about almost everything he's ever called

1233
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:59,295
Play From The globalist Playbook this should really worried the caller in the audience

1234
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:01,343
But they're not paying attention

1235
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:06,719
Alex satisfies their emotional needs with ramps like the one about stelter and their need to feel like

1236
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:07,999
A part of something important

1237
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:09,279
With the nonsense about

1238
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:12,095
Fighting close Schwab's digital Army by posting info

1239
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:15,935
As long as those needs are met and as long as that's the case

1240
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:18,239
The reality of it is just making

1241
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:20,799
Shut up all the time it doesn't really matter at all

1242
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:22,591
The audience will never care or

1243
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:24,383
Yeah that

1244
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:25,663
That caller

1245
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:26,687
Scares me

1246
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:27,711
A lot

1247
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:28,735
Because

1248
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:33,087
He sounded so rational and so sane

1249
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:34,623
And had a

1250
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:36,159
Clear thought process

1251
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:37,951
But if you listen to that

1252
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:38,719
That's the most

1253
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:40,255
Insane thing anybody's ever said

1254
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:47,167
That's the most insane Alex reads A Lot Alex reads a lot like a thing to say to a

1255
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:49,727
Alex strauts insane then

1256
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:52,031
I swear to you I would rather

1257
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:54,847
I believe more that Raptors would eat

1258
01:06:55,103 --> 01:07:01,247
Chocolate then I do that Alex reads When You Believe

1259
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:06,623
Chicken fried steak believe the second one more than Alex reads the second one is possible

1260
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:08,159
Yeah because Alex is a passive

1261
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:14,559
Participate

1262
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:20,959
Speak their chicken fried steak chicken fried steak Alex would work out a deal with

1263
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:21,983
Company

1264
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:22,751
For advertise

1265
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:26,079
Really good

1266
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:27,103
Love message

1267
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:28,127
Goddamn

1268
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:32,479
So Alex goes on to explain his work process to this caller

1269
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:33,759
Really

1270
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:39,391
Legislation

1271
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:40,671
I go and look at 1

1272
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:46,047
Paul's

1273
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:49,887
Address quickly

1274
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:57,311
Reading their bugs reading class Schwab statement in knowing what they're doing

1275
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:01,919
Books

1276
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:04,223
Written by the population controllers

1277
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:09,599
Henry Kissinger

1278
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:10,879
Program

1279
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:19,071
Wallace

1280
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:20,863
Collapse of society

1281
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:24,447
Seems to be a huge red flags anybody was listening Galaxy

1282
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:28,031
I mean like he has basically these old Tech

1283
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:32,127
But I don't know if he's even read or not or is he's just like

1284
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:38,527
Taking them in by way of like John Birch Society literature the demon eyes those but I think that's more likely

1285
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:42,623
Part of the Lord actually read yes

1286
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:46,719
He talks about like ecoscience by John Beholder never read that f****** textbook

1287
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:47,487
Out of here

1288
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:53,887
His work clothes just like I skinned my own website

1289
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:55,167
Dim some other websites

1290
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:58,495
And then I go check the Twitter accounts of s*** heads like pasovic

1291
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:00,031
I mean

1292
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:02,591
That's not great

1293
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:08,991
In the context of the rationality of the question that he is responding to which I do I mean

1294
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:15,391
Idea Lego should we have a Cyber Sunday where we get rid of all of our things and actually just hungry butt face

1295
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:16,671
Really fun with that

1296
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:17,951
To respond to that with

1297
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:18,975
Here's what I do

1298
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:20,511
Ice Kim s***

1299
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:26,911
And then I just kind of get the vibe of how people are talking about it and then

1300
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:28,447
Putting out talking

1301
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:36,639
Double down on the finger-post remix

1302
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:37,663
And that's my job

1303
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:43,039
And I started the day by looking at my own website to pay people to write

1304
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:49,951
Headlines for responding to people who are paid to write things that will tickle me

1305
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:57,375
Yeah that's a bizarre Circle

1306
01:09:57,631 --> 01:09:59,167
I did is I created is like okay

1307
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:00,447
Do you remember Elvis

1308
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:03,263
This group of Yes man that always said yes around Elvis

1309
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:04,287

1310
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:05,055
Exactly

1311
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:06,847
So I turned that into a job

1312
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:11,455
Add job to say yes to everything I have to say

1313
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:15,295
Alex gets to thinking about so like what he needs

1314
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:16,063

01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:53,599
That place

1350
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:56,927
Properly under attack

We have to do that now

1357
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:20,479
We made the circuit

1358
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:24,319
Present

1359
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:28,671

Saxons of Germany

Manipulate

1462
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:08,735
They have been

1463
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:10,015
Using tomato

1464
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:11,039
Control

1465
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:12,831
George Washington warned us against the

1466
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:13,599
The power

1467
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:15,135
Political parties

1468
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:17,183
Nationality

1469
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:19,743
We Are you standing up against movie happy

1470

The majority of the Mastiff support Infowars

1471
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:27,167
Who are against you

1472
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:29,215
I stand against the Masters

1473
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:31,263
Because we are using

1474
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:32,799
The Powerball

1475
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:35,103
Communication

1476
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:41,759
Do you make a plow swab the information Warfare against us

1477
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:44,319
He's going to launch info Warriors

1478
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:48,159
Yeah they off minute totally

1479
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:51,231
Pegasus guy doesn't know that it's two years old

1480
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:54,815
All of the Lord of pet did you ever notice how the Lord is

1481
01:17:55,071 --> 01:18:01,215
Exactly as dumb as the person talking about him the deity has the information that the individual

1482
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:05,055
Potter County

1483
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:06,079
Only knows what

1484
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:11,199
The Lord wants him to know cuz download The Departed upon him

1485
01:18:11,455 --> 01:18:17,599
Yeah good call Lord you got me on this one so apparently Alex has chosen as a leader by God

1486
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:21,439
The majority of the United States supports Infowars

1487
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:22,463
That's

1488
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:25,023
Absolutely. Seems like a lot

1489
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:31,423
For the message to see if my experience obviously

1490
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:33,215
Professionally

1491
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:34,751
You can't really judge

1492
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:36,799
The temperature of Alex

1493
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:40,383
Cuz I run in circles that are pretty a Infowars

1494
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:41,407
Naturally

1495
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:43,967
And so I ain't I put that to the side

1496
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:48,319
Number of people that I interact with just you know whether it's

1497
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:51,391
Somebody in a in a service capacity or

1498
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:52,159
You know

1499
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:54,207
Just a random person and generally

1500
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:55,743
Anybody asked me

1501
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:57,279
And sometimes Lyft drivers

1502
01:18:57,535 --> 01:19:01,375
I've been there like what I do

1503
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:03,167
And I'll explain it and usually it's

1504
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:04,703
Alex Jones who

1505
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:09,311
Like most of the guy in Austin who is

1506
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:12,639
The masses have really not

1507
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:15,455
Just a low level of support for Alex so much

1508
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:19,039
Because they have no idea who that motherfuker is in Austin

1509
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:25,439
Sticks out in the memory because he was the one person that I've encountered in the wild

1510
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:29,279
Really that's a has-been what who is a supporter

1511
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:32,863
I think generally it's people who have no idea

1512
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:35,167
M-maybe wood

1513
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:37,471
Black guy

1514
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:39,519
Is that guy who likes

1515
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:41,055
Big Trump guy

1516
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:44,639
Yeah it was a January 6th through something you don't like

1517
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:51,039
This is not Star-Lord he is a character actor in the show.

1518
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:53,343
Yeah yeah

1519
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:55,903
Appointed leader to his fans right

1520
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:58,975
F****** child with a boo-boo

1521
01:19:59,231 --> 01:20:01,023
YouTube most people who

1522
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:02,303
Buy pay attention

1523
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:07,679
I thought it's not a gas

1524
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:18,944
I thought I guess

1525
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:19,968
Caesar employee

1526
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:22,528
He's a guy who works at

1527
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:25,344
Does Alex know that

1528
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:31,488
With the rotating cast of people that he knows for sure because Greg Reese

1529
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:34,816
People Alex places reports all the time on the show

1530
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:36,608
Each one is the best

1531
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:37,888
That's ever been made

1532
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:42,240
And if you go to video you'll find that his videos get

1533
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:44,544
Significantly more traffic then

1534
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,592
Even like Owen or

1535
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:47,616
Harrison Smith

1536
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:48,640
Soleil

1537
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:50,688
Alex is somebody who is

1538
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:53,760
Nothing if not motivated by traction true

1539
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:55,552
Greg gets a firebox

1540
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:57,856
Videos are pretty slick Lee done

1541
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:00,928
Pacey shows competence

1542
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:02,208
In certain aspects

1543
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:05,280
I went to that

1544
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:06,560
I wouldn't say that

1545
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:08,608
Maybe in terms of editing

1546
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:10,144
Like there's some kompa

1547
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:12,960
Since they are

1548
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:16,288
Jarring to listen to

1549
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:17,056
Is just stupid

1550
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:22,176
He has an idea

1551
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:26,272
I want to see if you can come up with some ways this idea might go bad

1552
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:29,856
I think everyone in the world is starting to wake up to that fact right now

1553
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:33,696
That the Federal Reserve fiat currency system is with responsible

1554
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:35,488
All the problems in the world right now

1555
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:37,792
People talking about

1556
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:39,328
Silver and gold mines

1557
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:43,168
Going into private business as Bank since they have the vault already and they

1558
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:44,960
Tire crypto card to

1559
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:46,240
Gold and silver

1560
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:47,776
And then

1561
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:49,312
The private Market

1562
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:52,384
Free private Market can just compete for people's trust and

1563
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:54,176
Serviceability and

1564
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:58,016
Start creating a parallel banking system

1565
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:04,160
Z12

1566
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:06,720
Call Susan idea of some type of

1567
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:07,488
Digital

1568
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:09,024
Fiat currency is if

1569
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:11,584
I mean only

1570
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:14,912
Take after all of the death and destruction they've caused four decades and decades

1571
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:16,704
That's obviously the plan

1572
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:18,752
How to get 8 million in Bitcoin

1573
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:19,776
Look

1574
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:21,568
Did this is a dumb idea

1575
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:23,104
You don't understand

1576
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:24,896
He just invented mining town

1577
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:26,688
It makes perfect sense

1578
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:27,456
Alright

1579
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:31,296
Here's what we do all right we go all the way to the West

1580
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:34,880
Okay we get a covered wagon together we get all buds

1581
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:36,672
Together we build a little tent

1582
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:38,464
We open up our own

1583
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:44,352
General Store around the mind and people will pay us with the gold that they recently banned

1584
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:45,632
Out of the river

1585
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:50,752
The only people could really afford to run that store anyway are the people around the vibe so you know

1586
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:53,056
So I think that's a great idea they should

1587
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:54,336
Actually

1588
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:56,640
Give their own currency out

1589
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:59,456
That is a big guarantee using their money so you can

1590
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:02,016
Can only buy the stuff I think that's

1591
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:05,600
Yeah this is my booth

1592
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:07,904
This is wild I mean also

1593
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:08,672
Just

1594
01:23:08,928 --> 01:23:09,696
Logistically

1595
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:13,280
I think the people who have a lot of resources

1596
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:16,352
Right now are going to be able to buy those mines

1597
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:19,168
I think you'll end up with

1598
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:20,960
Probably oligarch

1599
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:23,264
Mine back

1600
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:24,032
Yeah

1601
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:26,592
Who will be able to babysit

1602
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:29,152
Unregulated by the way this is that's also

1603
01:23:29,408 --> 01:23:34,272
Definitely an implied part of the system Arizona

1604
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:38,112
There's so many opportunities for abuse of the system

1605
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:39,392
It's just it's almost

1606
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:42,464
Parody of itself

1607
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:43,232
Tech Bros

1608
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:49,632
And all those stupid people invent things that we already invented a long time ago and then I put a new name on it

1609
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:55,264
I really don't appreciate it whenever we do have like a history

1610
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:56,800
Where people did the

1611
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:57,824
Step-by-step

1612
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,616
Sing that you're recommending

1613
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:02,432
And you can go back and you can read about how it turned out

1614
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:08,832
You can just read about it it happened before

1615
01:24:09,088 --> 01:24:15,232
Stop doing it that bad thing we did that led to everybody dying in the Great

1616
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:16,256
Depression and all that s***

1617
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:17,792
Hahaha but what

1618
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:19,584
But if we did it again

1619
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:23,168
So Greg's at another dumb thing to say chair

1620
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:24,960
Big picture your smart guy

1621
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:28,288
Lies

1622
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:35,712
I think the test is clear I think that they were being offered

1623
01:24:36,224 --> 01:24:36,992
It's offering except

1624
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:39,808
They've been doing this for years they're offering us

1625
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:40,576
Slavery

1626
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:43,136
They actually started offer a slavery

1627
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:48,256
Years ago I think I started at 6019 right after the Revolutionary run there

1628
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:49,536
Broke his back into it

1629
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:50,304
And

1630
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:55,168
Ultimately it's our choice ultimately we don't we don't have to be slaves we could actually

1631
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:57,728
Become independent become responsible

1632
01:24:58,496 --> 01:25:04,640
The offering you slavery that's not really slavery and back at the Revolutionary War

1633
01:25:04,896 --> 01:25:08,224
Not offer flavors

1634
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:09,760
Generations

1635
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:12,064
Talking about these people

1636
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:16,160
It's just so amazing being offered slaver

1637
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:17,184
You get to see

1638
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:18,976
How is that allowed

1639
01:25:19,488 --> 01:25:20,768
Infowars

1640
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:21,536
Pedo Island

1641
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:25,888
People who like the same preferred good not going to college I swear to God you should

1642
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:26,912
Ashamed for not

1643
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:28,960
Reading comprehension in 4th grade

1644
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:29,984
That's what should be happy

1645
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:35,360
I think that they can read and there's some reading comprehension there's just

1646
01:25:35,616 --> 01:25:36,896
I don't know what you're reading

1647
01:25:37,152 --> 01:25:39,712
Yeah maybe you're just reading s*** wingdings

1648
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:45,344
Read a real book it's just a bunch of it's like who

1649
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:46,112
It's like what

1650
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:47,136
Bork

1651
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:52,512
You're just suspicious of everything you read until like when you read a line that says X you like

1652
01:25:52,768 --> 01:25:58,912
Trick me into thinking and actually saying is why

1653
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:01,984
Why is it that nobody believes in the Double Bluff of book

1654
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:04,544
So you know they're like they think you're tricking you

1655
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:08,896
But they're actually telling the truth it's a double blah blah blah

1656
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:14,016
Researcher

1657
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:15,552
Great minds

1658
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:16,576
Gregory's

1659
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:21,952
We're going to win this because you can see it at the way they've had this thing whole plan

1660
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,536
They weren't expecting this much

1661
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:27,072
Push back expecting this much

1662
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:28,352
Define

1663
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:30,656
Expecting more people to take the vaccine

1664
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:33,472
Which tells me that

1665
01:26:33,728 --> 01:26:37,312
2000 Infowars

1666
01:26:39,104 --> 01:26:39,872
Right right

1667
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:42,432
I mean it

1668
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:48,832
Just going along with Alex's bulshit story about a two-year-old podcast that he's now saying Klaus Schwab said

1669
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:50,624
He had all about himself which wasn't

1670
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:52,928
The case

1671
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:54,720
Solely with

1672
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:57,280
The idea of misinformation

1673
01:26:57,792 --> 01:27:01,376
And yeah Gregory's so just going along to get along

1674
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:02,144
Yeah

1675
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:04,192
Yeah that is such a weird

1676
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:05,472
Example of

1677
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:06,496
Total capture

1678
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:08,288
Just like

1679
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,592
Hey the sky is orange

1680
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:11,616
Disguise

1681
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:12,896
Just Orange

1682
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:16,480
Green and orange striped Lycra

1683
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:17,760
The flag

1684
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:23,136
Wow there is no bottom

1685
01:27:23,392 --> 01:27:23,904
None

1686
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:25,440
Fox capture

1687
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:26,976
So

1688
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:28,256
These people love

1689
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:32,096
So into individualism

1690
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:34,144
They think that you

1691
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:37,472
You are the greatest thing and God is like

1692
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:38,496
Working through you

1693
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:40,544
And that's why they do whatever Alex tells them

1694
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:41,824
To do individuality

1695
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:45,664
And also maybe some people are so dumb that we need leaders

1696
01:27:47,968 --> 01:27:50,784
You know 34 years ago that we need leadership I might have argued that

1697
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:52,320
But after seeing covid

1698
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:55,904
And realizing that a large amount of the population is

1699
01:27:56,928 --> 01:27:57,440
Sheep-like

1700
01:27:57,952 --> 01:27:58,720
We need fruit

1701
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:05,632
How to respect and love for our fellow man we do need leadership

1702
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:07,424
Is there going to be

1703
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:12,544
Not control them but leave the Good Shepherd

1704
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:13,568
That's what we have to

1705
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:19,968
2B we want people to be independent believe themselves but if they believe things that are different to what rise

1706
01:28:20,224 --> 01:28:22,784
We must for their own good leave

1707
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:23,808
Them

1708
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:25,344
That's a good shepherd

1709
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:29,440
Yeah no I don't understand why people don't understand that religion is great

1710
01:28:29,952 --> 01:28:36,096
If people don't believe what you have to say you torture them until they do benevolence Orchard

1711
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:39,168
It's the way that God meant things to run

1712
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:41,728
The lord gave me a message

1713
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:45,824
And to be fair I mean I do think that we need to leadership as well not because I think

1714
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:50,688
People are too dumb to leave themselves or anything share I think that there are other benefits

1715
01:28:50,944 --> 01:28:51,456
Put Wii game

1716
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:52,736
Through leadership

1717
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:54,272
Things like Morales

1718
01:28:54,528 --> 01:28:55,040
Things like feeling

1719
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:56,064
Connected to each other

1720
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:57,856
Sure they're all kinds of

1721
01:28:58,112 --> 01:29:01,696
Benefits but the way they're looking at it has a real

1722
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:03,488
Patronizing

1723
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,024
U of A

1724
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:06,048
Just the public

1725
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:07,328
Makes sense

1726
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:10,144
I don't care about people it'll think people are great

1727
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:18,080
So they don't want somebody who's the leader who's going to listen to the people who's going to synthesize it for

1728
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:21,408
Probation and then ultimately is going to take responsibility for that

1729
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:22,176
Decision

1730
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:23,200
They make

1731
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:24,736
No that's called leader

1732
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:35,232
Providing a message that people can rally behind other form of leadership you could

1733
01:29:35,744 --> 01:29:38,304
Consider would be something along the lines of

1734
01:29:38,816 --> 01:29:40,096
A iron fist

1735
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:40,864
The dictatorship

1736
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:42,912
Now is that leadership

1737
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:48,800
That's a good shepherd well it's a shepherd of sorts ineffective Shepherd

1738
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:49,824
So you like beef

1739
01:29:50,336 --> 01:29:54,944
Not if it's shepherded wrong well Alex Lowe's beef

1740
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:58,016
Is actually one of the most nutritious

1741
01:29:58,272 --> 01:30:04,416
It's the sacred cow it's a life-sustaining

1742
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:08,512
Because it's consumed

1743
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:11,328
Bible Genesis

1744
01:30:14,656 --> 01:30:18,240
Along with whatever just whatever

1745
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:19,008
So I think

1746
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:23,616
Greg is trying to point to the idea that cows are sacred in Hindu culture which is dumb because there's

1747
01:30:23,872 --> 01:30:24,384
Specifically

1748
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:25,664
Like your day they don't

1749
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:27,456
Slaughter and eat cows because they're

1750
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:31,296
Sacred cow because beef is delicious

1751
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:32,320
Good love it

1752
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:33,600
This is mistaken

1753
01:30:33,856 --> 01:30:36,928
Not start by talking about beef

1754
01:30:37,184 --> 01:30:43,328
It's what's for dinner saith the Lord it starts with God existing an ovoid formless nothingness

1755
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:45,632
Creating the Earth in light and all that stuff

1756
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:51,776
It's not until Genesis 1:24 that land animals are created after vegetable

1757
01:30:52,032 --> 01:30:53,568
Fulshear

1758
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:56,384
But humans are said to be Lords over the natural world

1759
01:30:56,896 --> 01:31:03,040
Interesting Lee though God does say quote I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that

1760
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:03,808
Has fruit with

1761
01:31:04,064 --> 01:31:04,576
Seed in it

1762
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:06,368
They will be yours for food

1763
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:10,720
The Bible doesn't start with passage about beef and that's really embarrassing

1764
01:31:10,976 --> 01:31:13,536
A great just yes and that s***

1765
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:18,912
Who cares I mean Max captures irony is that the first real discussion regarding beef

1766
01:31:19,424 --> 01:31:21,216
Ends with a murder

1767
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:22,496
Better than

1768
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:27,104
Facebook the first big like what's beef about

1769
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:28,128
Murder

1770
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:30,688
She's pretty obvious from

1771
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:37,600
The sacred cow idea

1772
01:31:38,112 --> 01:31:40,416
And Drake a strong idea

1773
01:31:40,672 --> 01:31:42,464
Kind of but he actually even has a

1774
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:43,232
Worst Rock

1775
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:46,560
I'm doing the report

1776
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:50,912
Has like vegetarianism is sort of connected to yoga

1777
01:31:51,424 --> 01:31:55,008
And there's a bunch of the popular and there's always be into that

1778
01:31:56,544 --> 01:31:57,312
Because if you actually look at the

1779
01:31:57,568 --> 01:31:59,104
That was based on the caste system

1780
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:01,408
Vegetarians were just a lower caste

1781
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:07,808
Please explain Street Glide

1782
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:14,464
Save the meat for the opportunity

1783
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:19,072
System where we're all these lower peasants eating bugs and then they can fly Ronnie Jets and have all the good

1784
01:32:19,328 --> 01:32:19,840
Stuff you know

1785
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:22,912
Definitely some connections between the caste system and rates

1786
01:32:23,168 --> 01:32:29,312
Vegetarianism in traditional Indian culture but what Greg is doing is oversimplifying things in a way that is specifically designed

1787
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:34,944
Took a one-to-one with modern-day Infowars talking points like how close Schwab wants you to eat bugs

1788
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:38,272
Many of the lower classes in the caste system we're not

1789
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:39,296
Practicing Hindu

1790
01:32:39,808 --> 01:32:43,648
So they wouldn't have been concerned with the dietary restrictions that largely sound

1791
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:45,696
From Hindu beliefs and non-violence

1792
01:32:46,464 --> 01:32:51,584
Conversely many of the brahmins were actually you know their priests and members of the scholarly class

1793
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:56,192
As you might expect they're what they were more observant people in terms of

1794
01:32:56,960 --> 01:33:01,312
The phenomenon you see when you look at historical Trends related to the caste system in vegetarianism

1795
01:33:01,568 --> 01:33:03,872
Is actually that the hire someone is in cash

1796
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:06,176
The more likely they are to be vegetarian

1797
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:11,040
So what Greg is saying but if this doesn't work for The Tile Shop

1798
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:12,832
Schwab wants you to eat bugs being so

1799
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:16,160
He's pretending that there is no Hindu belief in this

1800
01:33:16,672 --> 01:33:22,560
Do no harm thing that just trying to trick poor people into eating plan so they could save the cows for themselves

1801
01:33:22,816 --> 01:33:27,680
I do recall reading be apologizing thinking man this is all about how the Richmond

1802
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:30,752
That's what it is

1803
01:33:31,008 --> 01:33:32,800
The argument that Greg is making his absurd

1804
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:39,200
But the reality of this Dynamic is actually far more complicated than even the picture that I've described and I'm not doing Justice to the new

1805
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:39,968
Nuances of

1806
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:41,760
Of how this plays out in

1807
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:43,552
Tradition

1808
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:50,976
It's there's a lot of it has a history that is almost impossible to unravel

1809
01:33:51,232 --> 01:33:52,000
Credible

1810
01:33:52,256 --> 01:33:55,840
Very very complex notion that it's like

1811
01:33:56,096 --> 01:33:56,608
Tricking the

1812
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:58,400
The poor people into eating vegetables

1813
01:33:58,912 --> 01:34:00,960
Vaccaro's for themselves for me

1814
01:34:01,472 --> 01:34:07,616
Wow write it on the board that sounds trophy scriptures in it

1815
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:09,152
Scriptures

1816
01:34:09,664 --> 01:34:11,456
Greg Vader

1817
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:14,016
Greg

1818
01:34:14,272 --> 01:34:15,552
Back to his time but

1819
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:16,832
Getting it in for right

1820
01:34:18,624 --> 01:34:20,672
What he does here is he isolates

1821
01:34:20,928 --> 01:34:22,464
A real serious problem

1822
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:24,256
When I first came here

1823
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:26,048
You know 4 years ago

1824
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:31,936
Very open-minded very skeptical of us suspicious suspicious person

1825
01:34:32,192 --> 01:34:32,704
Are you

1826
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:33,728
Stories about

1827
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:38,336
You know controlled opposition everything so who knows but I got here I was just basically

1828
01:34:38,848 --> 01:34:39,360
Call Dad

1829
01:34:40,896 --> 01:34:42,944
Story that I think is important and

1830
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:46,016
And do my best to get right and stick to the truth and

1831
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:46,784
That was it

1832
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:49,344
Remember asking Robin told me that I was like

1833
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:53,440
Should I show it to anyone first to make sure that it's proved and you just looked at me

1834
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:54,976
Almost witness customs

1835
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:59,328
We don't have time for that you know and it's true everyone out here we're working

1836
01:34:59,584 --> 01:35:02,912
Oh my God

1837
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:07,008
My God you have no time for quality control

1838
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:08,544
To see if it's full of s***

1839
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:09,312
Wow

1840
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:10,080
Wow

1841
01:35:10,848 --> 01:35:14,688
Spell process

1842
01:35:14,944 --> 01:35:16,480
Or can I at least trained with somebody

1843
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:22,880
Boilerplate

1844
01:35:23,136 --> 01:35:24,160
Reliable sources

1845
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:27,744
Control app for reliable sources of Infowars

1846
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:32,608
Yeah I would think that one of the things

1847
01:35:32,864 --> 01:35:34,912
The code Aid Infowars the most actually

1848
01:35:35,168 --> 01:35:35,936
I take that back

1849
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:38,752
Cuz it would completely destroy the process

1850
01:35:39,264 --> 01:35:43,616
You're misunderstanding their business would get on air

1851
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:47,968
What are you

1852
01:35:48,224 --> 01:35:48,736
They would quit

1853
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:56,928
I mean that's the thing that they really are you know we talked about how they're lying and they don't give a s*** and they're making everything up

1854
01:35:57,440 --> 01:36:00,000
But we're really not talking about is if they did it

1855
01:36:00,512 --> 01:36:02,048
Is any Challenge on the way to

1856
01:36:02,304 --> 01:36:03,584
To publishing one of those stories

1857
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:05,376
They would give up and then do a

1858
01:36:05,632 --> 01:36:11,008
That's probably true and I think not only lie and make all this s*** up

1859
01:36:11,264 --> 01:36:12,032
They've also can

1860
01:36:12,288 --> 01:36:13,312
Instructed a system

1861
01:36:13,568 --> 01:36:14,336
Like

1862
01:36:15,104 --> 01:36:18,176
AIDs that system that is

1863
01:36:18,432 --> 01:36:21,504
Complicit and complementary to making s*** up

1864
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:22,784
No no it is 8

1865
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:25,344
It is a little bit like when you see Apes

1866
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:28,928
Put a stick in in a tree and then ants come up and you're like

1867
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:32,256
You guys figured that out all on your own that's buck

1868
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:37,120
You figured out that no quality control meme

1869
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:38,144
Exactly

1870
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:39,424
So

1871
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:40,448
Big dumb

1872
01:36:42,752 --> 01:36:43,520
This is the most

1873
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:50,688
Divine inspired job I've ever had my life I've never felt

1874
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:51,712
Name your other job

1875
01:36:55,808 --> 01:36:57,856
Was very aware that I was lacking

1876
01:37:00,928 --> 01:37:01,952
Feel like I've been doing

1877
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:04,256
God's work and it's been extremely humbling

1878
01:37:05,024 --> 01:37:07,328
And

1879
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:09,376
We believe you believe it

1880
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:10,912
Fighting for our survival

1881
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:13,728
We think anybody should just join us

1882
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:15,520
Would you not join us

1883
01:37:15,776 --> 01:37:17,056
Almost everything you say

1884
01:37:18,336 --> 01:37:19,104
That's why I would

1885
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:25,504
Join him so I don't take much stock in that either

1886
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:27,296
Yeah yeah Lottery

1887
01:37:27,552 --> 01:37:28,320
Seems not to join the Alex

1888
01:37:28,832 --> 01:37:30,368
A lot of talk

1889
01:37:30,624 --> 01:37:33,696
About divine ordainment

1890
01:37:33,952 --> 01:37:35,232
Surrounding

1891
01:37:35,744 --> 01:37:37,024
Various Infowars stuff

1892
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:38,560
On this episode that I find

1893
01:37:38,816 --> 01:37:41,120
Real trouble and you know you know what that that

1894
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:44,192
Alright

1895
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:47,264
Maybe Infowars doesn't have a handbook

1896
01:37:47,776 --> 01:37:48,288
Alright

1897
01:37:48,544 --> 01:37:50,848
But there is a handbook that they're supposed to follow

1898
01:37:51,104 --> 01:37:51,616
True

1899
01:37:51,872 --> 01:37:54,176
What is the Bible and those m************ haven't read that

1900
01:37:54,944 --> 01:37:59,040
Because cleaner on

1901
01:37:59,296 --> 01:38:00,576
The story isn't just

1902
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:05,440
Stick to the truth as close as you can. We don't have time to work out the Kinks

1903
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:06,976
Well I think

1904
01:38:07,232 --> 01:38:09,792
They have not gotten past the beef part yet

1905
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:11,072
That is a good part

1906
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:14,144
It really sets the stage hurts so much to get the risk

1907
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:15,680
Right

1908
01:38:16,448 --> 01:38:20,800
We haven't even got a later on did you know that the Pope

1909
01:38:21,056 --> 01:38:23,104
Classified beavers

1910
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:24,128
The fish what

1911
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:25,664
Yeah you know why

1912
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:27,456
Friday's couldn't eat fish

1913
01:38:27,712 --> 01:38:32,064
Beaver fish

1914
01:38:32,832 --> 01:38:33,344
So

1915
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:34,112
The devil

1916
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:35,904
What about unloyal

1917
01:38:36,672 --> 01:38:38,464
Don't take it they're going to be left with the bill

1918
01:38:40,256 --> 01:38:41,792
That's a thing you know

1919
01:38:44,096 --> 01:38:47,168
Powell oil the devil is cuz all these people are these people

1920
01:38:47,424 --> 01:38:48,192
The Pelosi's annoy people

1921
01:38:48,704 --> 01:38:50,496
Dedicated their lives

1922
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:52,544
To this evil

1923
01:38:53,056 --> 01:38:59,200
Force and what are they going to return it they're just getting put out to pasture and and used one last time for the guy

1924
01:38:59,968 --> 01:39:02,272
There's no loyalty all these people are going to do

1925
01:39:02,528 --> 01:39:05,344
Award

1926
01:39:07,648 --> 01:39:08,416
Get it

1927
01:39:09,184 --> 01:39:09,952
Where's David Knight

1928
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:15,584
Where's Millie Weaver any of your old there is his loyalty

1929
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:18,144
Loyal and they were disloyal so they must be

1930
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:22,496
Tossed it to the Sun

1931
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:23,776
One-way ride

1932
01:39:24,032 --> 01:39:30,176
It's loyalty does not go both ways loyalty is not a two-way street my friend I would

1933
01:39:30,688 --> 01:39:31,968
Not a good example of

1934
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:33,504
Loyalty loyalty

1935
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:37,600
Loyalty think about all the names that he

1936
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:39,136
Can't get away Kenosha

1937
01:39:39,392 --> 01:39:41,440
Jakari calls him up every weekend

1938
01:39:41,696 --> 01:39:46,304
I'm so loyal I want to try and help you find a new gig jhacari

1939
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:47,072
Very loyal

1940
01:39:47,584 --> 01:39:48,352
I mean

1941
01:39:48,864 --> 01:39:51,168
He couldn't even remember Jason bermas

1942
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:57,568
He's talking about his early career as early as broadcast

1943
01:39:57,824 --> 01:40:00,128
Metaphorically speaking gun to his head

1944
01:40:00,384 --> 01:40:02,176
He could not remember birth

1945
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:03,200
Sad

1946
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:05,248
Disloyal some might say

1947
01:40:06,272 --> 01:40:07,296
Devil's looking pretty nice

1948
01:40:07,552 --> 01:40:08,576
In comparison honestly

1949
01:40:08,832 --> 01:40:12,160
100 million dollars Dakari didn't get s***

1950
01:40:13,184 --> 01:40:13,952
So Alex

1951
01:40:14,208 --> 01:40:14,976
Is it

1952
01:40:15,232 --> 01:40:15,744
I think

1953
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,024
Some of this

1954
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:19,072
Define ordained

1955
01:40:19,328 --> 01:40:21,376
Business is going to his head a little bit

1956
01:40:21,632 --> 01:40:22,144
Yeah

1957
01:40:22,656 --> 01:40:23,680
This is really f***** up

1958
01:40:24,448 --> 01:40:26,496
You know just where it where it really at the

1959
01:40:26,752 --> 01:40:31,104
The peak of all this right now and victory is going to be

1960
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:32,384
To wear Infowars

1961
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:33,152
Can

1962
01:40:35,712 --> 01:40:36,224
Appropriately

1963
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:40,832
To the point where we're no longer needed and we can borrow out that's mine

1964
01:40:41,088 --> 01:40:41,600
Company man

1965
01:40:42,624 --> 01:40:45,696
We need to mow support so that

1966
01:40:45,952 --> 01:40:46,464
Because it did the

1967
01:40:47,232 --> 01:40:48,512
VCR defeated

1968
01:40:48,768 --> 01:40:49,536
This is the defeated

1969
01:40:49,792 --> 01:40:50,304
The populist

1970
01:40:51,072 --> 01:40:51,840
Very symbolic

1971
01:40:52,608 --> 01:40:55,168
And so that's how I see victories to work

1972
01:41:01,056 --> 01:41:03,872
I'm actually know that repeating

1973
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:05,664
Exactly

1974
01:41:10,528 --> 01:41:11,552
Just going to create a

1975
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:13,088
Allegiant

1976
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:14,368
Looking for warriors

1977
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:16,416
Pushing the truth

1978
01:41:17,184 --> 01:41:18,208
Because you can't stop the truth

1979
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:21,280
Yeah it repeats has

1980
01:41:21,536 --> 01:41:22,560
F***** up repeat

1981
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:25,120
I'm not compare myself to Christ

1982
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:26,656
I'm just saying that the cycle of Christ

1983
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:28,704
Repeat that

1984
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:30,240
Suggested that it repeats

1985
01:41:30,496 --> 01:41:32,800
Does whatever sentiment you're trying

1986
01:41:33,056 --> 01:41:36,896
Convey with Idol

1987
01:41:37,152 --> 01:41:43,296
Close the gates the previous now I don't think of myself the same as Jesus

1988
01:41:43,808 --> 01:41:45,088
But

1989
01:41:45,344 --> 01:41:49,440
Now we're talking. But really changes things to Alex

1990
01:41:49,696 --> 01:41:51,232
Views himself as

1991
01:41:51,488 --> 01:41:53,024
Somebody who will be sacrificed

1992
01:41:54,048 --> 01:41:55,840
For the sins of the left

1993
01:41:56,096 --> 01:42:00,448
Sacrifice will bring about

1994
01:42:00,704 --> 01:42:01,216
The cleansing

1995
01:42:01,728 --> 01:42:04,544
That the Patriots need to rise or something

1996
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:06,848
You know who's really really unsettling s***

1997
01:42:07,104 --> 01:42:08,384
If that's the case just f***

1998
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:10,688
Can get it over with man sacrifice yourself

1999
01:42:10,944 --> 01:42:14,272
No because I don't think he actually thinks

2000
01:42:14,528 --> 01:42:18,112
If you want the audience to think he looks at things this way because it's so Noble in

2001
01:42:18,368 --> 01:42:22,720
And selfless

2002
01:42:23,744 --> 01:42:27,328
We need to do is find a way to land This Plane without a crash

2003
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:30,656
You all need to give us a bunch of money so Alex

2004
01:42:30,912 --> 01:42:33,472
Text can have millions of dollars that he can disappear with

2005
01:42:33,728 --> 01:42:34,240
Or something

2006
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,568
That's the great ending for this story

2007
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:43,712
It's really more with that I'm sure they all want for this story is a sequel to that McAfee documentary

2008
01:42:43,968 --> 01:42:46,272
Alex's on the lam

2009
01:42:46,528 --> 01:42:47,552
That's where this goes

2010
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:48,832
Well

2011
01:42:49,856 --> 01:42:51,136
McAfee documentary

2012
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:57,792
Life as a documentary didn't

2013
01:43:00,096 --> 01:43:01,120
Six more calls of Gregory's

2014
01:43:01,376 --> 01:43:02,912
And this call is awesome

2015
01:43:03,936 --> 01:43:05,984
Which comment about the delusions of

2016
01:43:06,496 --> 01:43:07,264
Beautiful Warriors

2017
01:43:08,288 --> 01:43:08,800
I'm thinking that

2018
01:43:09,056 --> 01:43:09,568
Maybe

2019
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:10,848
That would be something

2020
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:12,640
A response to

2021
01:43:13,152 --> 01:43:13,664
Clash Royale

2022
01:43:15,456 --> 01:43:15,968
Info

2023
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:17,248
Checkers

2024
01:43:17,504 --> 01:43:18,016
So to speak

2025
01:43:18,272 --> 01:43:18,784
And that

2026
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:20,064
It might also be awake

2027
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:20,832
2

2028
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:21,856
Nobody to the

2029
01:43:22,368 --> 01:43:25,184
Today checking account it enforces if you had just

2030
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:27,488
Stryver just a base

2031
01:43:27,744 --> 01:43:28,256
Membership

2032
01:43:30,304 --> 01:43:35,424
For now we get a little decal that I can probably put in them

2033
01:43:35,936 --> 01:43:36,704
That's a great idea

2034
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:43,104
I think people are more inclined to

2035
01:43:43,616 --> 01:43:45,152
Take action

2036
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:47,968
This is just going back to what he did originally

2037
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:50,016
He used to have memberships

2038
01:43:50,528 --> 01:43:51,040
This is

2039
01:43:51,296 --> 01:43:51,808
This is going

2040
01:43:52,064 --> 01:43:53,600
Full circle back to

2041
01:43:53,856 --> 01:43:54,880
What you did when

2042
01:43:55,648 --> 01:43:56,672
It is much smaller

2043
01:43:58,208 --> 01:44:00,000
He took sponsors when he could

2044
01:44:00,256 --> 01:44:02,304
Success sponsors

2045
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:03,840
Oh that's it went away

2046
01:44:04,352 --> 01:44:05,376
He sold gold

2047
01:44:05,632 --> 01:44:06,400
Is weirdo friend

2048
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:07,936
Until he lost his life

2049
01:44:08,192 --> 01:44:08,704
Since to sell price

2050
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:09,472
Just metals

2051
01:44:09,984 --> 01:44:11,008
Sold a bunch of supplements

2052
01:44:12,032 --> 01:44:13,056
Maybe now that's too expensive

2053
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:13,824
Pensive

2054
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:16,128
Alex

2055
01:44:16,384 --> 01:44:18,688
Alex I've invented this new idea it's called

2056
01:44:18,944 --> 01:44:20,992
Lower your overhead and taking donations

2057
01:44:21,248 --> 01:44:25,856
Asus brand new it's going to revolutionize the industry

2058
01:44:26,112 --> 01:44:28,416
Small Studio at Bedwell

2059
01:44:28,672 --> 01:44:30,464
Alex likes this idea

2060
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:33,792
Of course he does he always has to make sure the scholar knows that he had it

2061
01:44:43,264 --> 01:44:45,824
Launch it we should make it very clear now

2062
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:48,896
WhatsApp

2063
01:44:52,224 --> 01:44:54,272
Your lovely Larry we love you

2064
01:44:54,528 --> 01:44:55,552
Lovely Larry

2065
01:44:55,808 --> 01:44:57,856
Okay

2066
01:44:58,112 --> 01:45:02,976
20 years ago we created this Army we call them info Warriors and then two years ago

2067
01:45:03,232 --> 01:45:09,376
Somebody did a podcast and then yesterday I found out about it so they called themselves 110,000 into

2068
01:45:09,632 --> 01:45:13,728
Warriors so we need to announce that we're 100 that's you already were

2069
01:45:13,984 --> 01:45:16,800
Also Jason bermas didn't do a show called info Warrior

2070
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:19,104
Yeah

2071
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:20,128
This is

2072
01:45:20,384 --> 01:45:22,688
Is dumb but I do love ours is impulse to be like

2073
01:45:22,944 --> 01:45:24,224
I thought

2074
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:30,624
Not only not only am I glad you called in I had this idea this morning so I'm not

2075
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:36,768
Even dumber because it's are as I called have used a new ID

2076
01:45:37,024 --> 01:45:41,888
Have you thought about this thing that got four wheels and you put a motor on it and propels you forward what

2077
01:45:42,144 --> 01:45:42,656
Yeah

2078
01:45:42,912 --> 01:45:45,728
No I mean it's a car you should really look into car

2079
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:51,104
Okay tell you this is a great idea and I loved it I thought of this this morning

2080
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:54,944
You already thought of the car so to do that

2081
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:58,016
Something really weird

2082
01:45:58,272 --> 01:46:00,320
Too I just got the message

2083
01:46:00,576 --> 01:46:01,344
It's it's pretty remarkable

2084
01:46:02,112 --> 01:46:03,648
Let me just go ahead and say this now

2085
01:46:07,232 --> 01:46:08,768
Copper power for any of those

2086
01:46:14,912 --> 01:46:15,680
Not ready to talk about

2087
01:46:16,448 --> 01:46:16,960
Because it's such a big

2088
01:46:22,848 --> 01:46:26,176
Really in touch with Army intelligence

2089
01:46:29,248 --> 01:46:30,016
Pentagon leadership

2090
01:46:30,272 --> 01:46:30,784
Obelisk

2091
01:46:33,856 --> 01:46:34,880
I can tell you that

2092
01:46:40,512 --> 01:46:41,024
In fact

2093
01:46:41,536 --> 01:46:42,304
Always listen to 4

2094
01:46:44,352 --> 01:46:44,864
But but

2095
01:46:56,128 --> 01:46:56,896
Military

2096
01:46:58,432 --> 01:46:59,456
Look for us lyrics

2097
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:04,832
Powerball

2098
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:08,672
You did this

2099
01:47:08,928 --> 01:47:09,952
Infowars

2100
01:47:10,464 --> 01:47:12,512
Call Schwab didn't do this and that podcast

2101
01:47:12,768 --> 01:47:13,792
2 years ago but

2102
01:47:14,304 --> 01:47:15,584
There is a

2103
01:47:16,352 --> 01:47:19,168
Really f***** up delusions of grandeur going on here

2104
01:47:19,424 --> 01:47:22,752
Like obviously whether or not Alex believes it one thing

2105
01:47:23,264 --> 01:47:24,800
What he's expressing to his audience

2106
01:47:25,056 --> 01:47:26,592
Yeah it's f***** up enough on its own

2107
01:47:27,872 --> 01:47:28,640
Did the

2108
01:47:28,896 --> 01:47:32,224
Divinely ordained leadership nonsense that's going on throughout the

2109
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:33,248
The show is f***** up

2110
01:47:33,504 --> 01:47:35,040
And now Alex is saying

2111
01:47:35,552 --> 01:47:36,064
He's been

2112
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:37,856
Selected by the good

2113
01:47:38,112 --> 01:47:40,928
People within the CIA and the FBI to be the leader

2114
01:47:41,184 --> 01:47:44,768
Of whatever their nonsense

2115
01:47:45,024 --> 01:47:45,536
This is

2116
01:47:46,816 --> 01:47:48,608
I mean I don't know how else to put it.

2117
01:47:48,864 --> 01:47:49,376
Basically

2118
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:55,008
Appointed himself a revolutionary General

2119
01:47:55,264 --> 01:47:55,776
Was it

2120
01:47:56,032 --> 01:47:56,544
Last week

2121
01:47:57,056 --> 01:47:59,360
That that David Garris were on

2122
01:48:00,384 --> 01:48:01,664
Yeah it was one week ago

2123
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:03,968
Yep exactly from today okay now

2124
01:48:04,224 --> 01:48:06,272
I recall last week we learned

2125
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:09,344
That Glenn Beck was the FBI

2126
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:10,368
And in fact was

2127
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:16,000
The entire United States government's true but he got overthrown at some point we have to assume

2128
01:48:16,256 --> 01:48:18,560
So that was that was treated as a bad thing

2129
01:48:19,328 --> 01:48:21,120
And yet now in this time.

2130
01:48:21,888 --> 01:48:28,032
Alex is the FBI of the CIA

2131
01:48:28,288 --> 01:48:30,336
I am CIA in charge of that

2132
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:32,128
Right

2133
01:48:32,384 --> 01:48:37,248
Okay that's all right everybody is always in charge of everything here's the fun part

2134
01:48:37,504 --> 01:48:38,016
It's all imagine

2135
01:48:38,272 --> 01:48:41,088
That is the fun part that is the only thing that is fun

2136
01:48:42,112 --> 01:48:42,624
I guess

2137
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:45,952
The consequences really are just in what effect it has on his body

2138
01:48:46,208 --> 01:48:46,720
Right

2139
01:48:46,976 --> 01:48:51,072
What kind of emboldening or or radicalizing effect

2140
01:48:51,328 --> 01:48:52,096
You could have on people like

2141
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:57,984
He is essentially the George Washington mean I think everybody

2142
01:48:58,240 --> 01:48:58,752
Infowars

2143
01:48:59,008 --> 01:48:59,776
Start matchmaking

2144
01:49:00,032 --> 01:49:00,544
Demons Alec

2145
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:01,312
FBI badges

2146
01:49:01,568 --> 01:49:05,664
Why not they're in the CIA kind of like

2147
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:10,528
New Bill Cooper thing is everybody

2148
01:49:10,784 --> 01:49:14,624
Is citizen Corps

2149
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:16,160
Investigative yes

2150
01:49:16,416 --> 01:49:16,928
Arms

2151
01:49:17,184 --> 01:49:21,280
Yeah it's Greg swearing Allegiance

2152
01:49:21,536 --> 01:49:24,096
Do Alex has the know that's awesome

2153
01:49:24,352 --> 01:49:25,888
We need leadership we need a president

2154
01:49:28,704 --> 01:49:29,728
See you more as a leader

2155
01:49:29,984 --> 01:49:31,008
Off of this movement and Trump

2156
01:49:38,176 --> 01:49:38,688
Oh my God

2157
01:49:39,968 --> 01:49:40,480
It's

2158
01:49:43,296 --> 01:49:44,832
I said I'm not the leader they said

2159
01:49:52,512 --> 01:49:55,840
This is why you can't have a show without continuity

2160
01:49:56,096 --> 01:49:58,144
Okay well this is not okay

2161
01:49:58,400 --> 01:50:02,240
Cuz I know we're in the future this is even in the past this is the 19th

2162
01:50:02,496 --> 01:50:03,776
The last time we talked

2163
01:50:04,032 --> 01:50:04,544
He wasn't

2164
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:06,336
The head of the CIA

2165
01:50:06,592 --> 01:50:07,360
It didn't come up

2166
01:50:07,616 --> 01:50:13,760
No honestly the last episode

2167
01:50:14,272 --> 01:50:20,416
Seems like he was pretty excited about Elon Musk tweeted something sad that this is an issue for me

2168
01:50:20,672 --> 01:50:22,720
He's the head of the CIA or something

2169
01:50:24,512 --> 01:50:30,656
Part of the CIA

2170
01:50:30,912 --> 01:50:33,472
Days like this is the most important wheat Elon Musk has ever had

2171
01:50:33,728 --> 01:50:34,496
It's great to eat

2172
01:50:34,752 --> 01:50:37,824
Great to hear you wanted to run so I got a mess

2173
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:39,104
Message from God

2174
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:41,408
Also Elon Musk

2175
01:50:41,664 --> 01:50:47,808
Straight from the good people in the FBI and CIA

2176
01:50:48,064 --> 01:50:48,832
Iboats

2177
01:50:49,088 --> 01:50:52,160
To be the leader of this Patriot movement

2178
01:50:52,416 --> 01:50:54,720
Right go against vaccines

2179
01:50:54,976 --> 01:50:57,536
Steps of Alex is the leader of all this

2180
01:50:58,304 --> 01:50:58,816
I mean he get

2181
01:50:59,072 --> 01:50:59,584
Statues

2182
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:01,888
