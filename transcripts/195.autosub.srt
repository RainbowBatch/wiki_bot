Alex Jones

4
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,384
Indeed we are.

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,152
Damn

6
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:19,968
What's the farthest you've traveled

7
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:22,528
One.

8
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:23,552
Have you ever flown

9
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:24,320
10 hours

10
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:31,744
Remember where we flew out of my tab in New York

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,512
Two parrots

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,352
I don't know just

13
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:44,032
I don't know exactly how long it was terrorism

14
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,384
And then we took a little biplane

15
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,200
You should never do that

16
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:52,992
That's scary

17
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:56,064
7 Southwest

18
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,600

20
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,744
To be in a propeller plane

21
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:08,864
Review of all

22
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,632
Absolutely

23
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,168

00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,192
Absolutely

25
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:16,800
I'm sure you bring this up because you just got back from

26
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:19,616
They are weekend in Maine

27
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:25,248
Disclaimer I'm I'm off a lot of travel and from the airport

28
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,552
And I'm straight off watching the first

2 hours of SummerSlam so we're both

30
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,024
And then you go back

31
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:37,792
Second time because of the

32
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,584
Time zones and all the sudden

33
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,984
It is only six

People drink isn't that

38
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:55,456

I've been back in the past

62
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:55,872
Austin 2009

64
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,880
For you and our listeners

65
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,696
That the next episode will finally

66
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,816
All right on this Monday episode

67
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,656
At least once a week we should check in

68
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:23,776
And the present day and what's going on

69
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,056
Behind the curtain

70
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,592
And I'll see what's up

71
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:29,152
And so today we're going to be going over the Oggy

72
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,176
August 17th

73
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,736
2018 episode

74
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,016
My mind was

75
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:34,784
Blown

76
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:38,112
Wait what they're from a present

77
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:42,208
Yeah yeah alright there's there's a number of things that are going to happen

78
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,000
You're going to see on this show

79
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,024
That

80
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,864
What wild rainbro saddle takeover and hosts

81
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,168
For the rest of the day

82
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:55,776
That there's a lot of predictions that we've made about like

83
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:56,544
Going to happen

84
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,616
I think I think number of our predictions are accurate

85
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,688
But something is going on that no one

86
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,712
Could have predicted

87
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,736
And I don't think

88
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,504
Anybody

89
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,528
Except you and I

90
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,064
Would even have noticed

91
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:11,648
I believe are going to

92
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,512
Share some insight about what's happening you will not be able to get anywhere else

93
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,047
The first

94
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,583
Is that

95
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,631
This commercial

96
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,399
Plays

97
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,495
To do with money

98
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:32,639
Yep there's the money issues commercial plays before each

99
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:35,199
Chunk chunk

100
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,223
60 hour chunk

101
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,247
Is it hot

102
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:43,391
But it's just a recording of the screen

103
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,439
And each one starts with v

104
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:52,607
B h by Frederic Remington fully cooked Ready-to-Eat

105
00:04:59,263 --> 00:04:59,775
Yes

106
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,055
Order

107
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:05,919
Turn yourself life bacon

108
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:06,943
Sizzle when it comes

109
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,759
That's pretty that's pretty wild

110
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:11,551
The diamond

111
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,599
That's what I'm liking now

112
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,135
You've got the

113
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,159
You got some ads

114
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,975
We're very much not there before

115
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,023
I have not been in the

116
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:21,791
Levi class

117
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:27,167
Years that we've been the show

118
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,983
Now we've got sucking

119
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:37,151
Navigate to the beginning of the actual Special Report

120
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,175
Paul Joseph Watson

121
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:44,063
4 minutes

122
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,367
Eating cured bacon as opposed to

123
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,927
You cooking it yourself if not actually where I decided

124
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,487
Fast-forward through it and I listen to it is like

125
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:54,559
They're trying to

126
00:05:54,815 --> 00:06:00,959
To destroy Western Civilization

127
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,311
Starting off the ship

128
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,615
Something very familiar here but

129
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,431
Something else

130
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:17,855
It's Friday August 17th 2018

131
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,647
This is the second time within the first

132
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,439
8 minutes of the show that he's played the final

133
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:28,863
It only 81 days left until most important elections in US history

134
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:35,263
We are

135
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:41,663
All-out assault on Western civilization and America whatever you do realize the global

136
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,455
Miscalculation

137
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,991
Committed

138
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,039
Transmission

139
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:49,087
Whatever for the salt you can imagine

140
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,791
Hairstyles censorship in America

141
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,327
We are here exposing it

142
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:05,471
They're scared of this information because he answered

143
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,519
On this Friday Global broadcast

144
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:11,871
The most scary

145
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:14,175
Because we're the ones who can bring them.

146
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,223
If you notice that the beginning

147
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:20,063
He said that the midterms are the most important elections

148
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,087
Using US history

149
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,879
Is exactly what he said about the 20s

150
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,647
16 Alexa

151
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,463
It's not something that he said about previous alive

152
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:31,327
And the reason I'm bringing this up is because we take a glimpse now into Alex Jones

153
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,375
MB

154
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:35,423
What are described as a political hack

155
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,727
You know what I mean by because that's what

156
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,495
Sensationalist

157
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:41,311
People do all of the time we heard that over and over again

158
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,847
From people on these center right

159
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,615
Center-left

160
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:50,015
Right through the 2008 election even though 2004 election

161
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,807
This is the most important election of all time

162
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,111
Because they're trying to juice up the bass

163
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:57,695
They're trying to get people more excited and make sure the turnout is good

164
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,231
And now Alex is doing the exact

165
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,255
Thing which I think is

166
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,559
Coming of him

167
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,607
I know that I'm holding him too

168
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,631
To a standard that doesn't

169
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:06,911
But

170
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,703
There's a mythical ideal that Alex

171
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,823
It is above the rigmarole in the

172
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,639
You just finally found his team

173
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,431
Defense though

174
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,735
His world

175
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,271
This is not hyperbole

176
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,391
Like what he is because what's really going on in the in the midterms now is

177
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,487
A real situation

178
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,535
I don't know the answer is no

179
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,815
I don't think it's that important

180
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,423
But I don't think

181
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,751
I don't think that the Democrats getting a slim majority in something

182
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,031
Is necessarily going to

183
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,151
Republican

184
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:54,527
I don't think that's going to lead to running a bucket

185
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,111
Signing all sorts of immoral legislation

186
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,927
Any more than it already

187
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,743
It's not like they're going

188
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,279
Not still try

189
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,303
Right2know

190
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,607
It's still going to be like well now

191
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,631
Yeah push

192
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,167
I don't know I think it's

193
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:11,935
Incredibly

194
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,751
Fairly important

195
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,335
I am not I'm not ready to be

196
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,103
Be like

197
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:24,223
If the Democrats lose visit to the end of the world because that's sensationalize

198
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,015
In all honesty

199
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,855
2000 election was probably the most important election

200
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:33,951
America

201
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:34,719
That's for damn sure

202
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:39,839
Who is George h.w. Bush still alive

203
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:49,311
James

204
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:58,527
Old man who paints

205
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:08,511
Does he still want to live

206
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:15,423
That would be too far I think

207
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:22,079
I'm going to push the boundaries how crazy I can get

208
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,223
Imagine what that all

209
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,391
Objectified

210
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,183
So in this next clip

211
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,975
I think we see another thing

212
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,023
Is big

213
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,583
Volume body of partisan

214
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,655
Much more than like

215
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:51,263
A couple months ago

216
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:56,383
The left as I've told you for 20-plus years

217
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:02,527
Is brainwashed hate America and is trained by the high school colleges

218
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,831
The mainline churches

219
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,623
America

220
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:13,023
Is the ultimate Evil in the world because the globalist

221
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,583
America and other Western Nations

222
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,143
To enforce their planetary plan

223
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,167
Absolute

224
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,959
Incomplete domination

225
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:27,359
So the part that I'm referring to stop by saying I've been telling you for 20 years that the left

226
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,895
Brainwashed

227
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,943
You're in Tire platform

228
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:31,711
4 years

229
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,759
Was that the left and the right are the same

230
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:37,343
That they're equally bad and they are the same thing

231
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:42,207
He's not saying that anymore because we talked about a lot the right isn't the right

232
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:44,511
What is now the

233
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,815
Like the Republicans in the GOP

234
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,911
Crazy they said for the most part

235
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,983
These now it's not something that is like a political party

236
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,591
Political party

237
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,639
But the political party isn't what

238
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,663
Like

239
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,687
The GOP

240
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,223
20 years ago

241
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:04,991
Absolutely

242
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,527
If something is

243
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,831
Become beholding to

244
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:10,879
White

245
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,903
Nationalism

246
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:17,535
Justin Bieber

247
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,327
It's not a political party it's a

248
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,095
Exploitation

249
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:30,335
Crazy weird

250
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,871
Republican

251
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,407
Maybe we should govern the country

252
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:34,687
Instead of

253
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:37,759
Maybe we should strip mine and make sure the poor people died in the

254
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,807
Is it maybe this could go bad

255
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,111
Which did not do that

256
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,463
Alex actually has a really correct

257
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,887
Obviously

258
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,167
Losing

259
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,191
Everything around him

260
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,727
You've been sued

261
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:58,751
Buy multiple

262
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,799
He's being

263
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,359
Talked about more than ever

264
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:06,943
A lot of people are talking about him

265
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,319
It's being brought up

266
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,111
Like that

267
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:14,879
Because

268
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:21,023
Creating a version

269
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,071
And it's really interesting

270
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:31,007
No you can't bring that up how dare you

271
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:36,127
CB for truckers band

272
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,783
So here's

273
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,087
He gets into what he perceives to be what's happening

274
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:45,855
Thing in the world

275
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:46,879
He's not not correct

276
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,607
The West that is all confirmed

277
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,383
They're going to nougat

278
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,759
It doesn't work like that

279
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,807
You know what if Obama was

280
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,831
Alex

281
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:17,855
Kicked off Facebook

282
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,135
R&B on Alex's

283
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:23,487
Like it really was the government doing something like that

284
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:29,119
Write be on his side

285
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:33,215
Sort of support for private Corporation

286
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:36,799
At the government

287
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:44,735
There's no way anyone would accept government

288
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:53,183
Even if you were able to

289
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,743
To produce evidence that these like

290
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,767
YouTube

291
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,303
Baume & Facebook

292
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,583
Melky

293
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,911
Like if you can produce evidence for me that all of them

294
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:05,727
Together and say hey let's kick Alex off at the same time

295
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:08,031
I'm not sure I'm going to side with Alex

296
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,823
But it'll be different conversation

297
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,591
Absolutely

298
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,127
I don't believe that they are working

299
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,431
In concert

300
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:17,503
It seems very clear that one jumped in there all we're like we can

301
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,111
Cour de Lane

302
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:29,535
Not like in some way to take coordinated and had that planned

303
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,095
Bruise that then

304
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:35,935
Then I would have the exact same conversation that I've already willing to have in that is

305
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,959
These companies

306
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:40,799
Suppression of a three-piece cuz it's not the government

307
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:45,151
Together like if there was a backroom deal

308
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,455
What's the CEOs of all of those corporate

309
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,759
And they all agreed on something

310
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,807
That's where we get into like

311
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,343
Torches and pitchforks

312
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,135
Territory because that is

313
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,671
Tremendous overreach

314
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,439
Give a power that

315
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,463
Can't be allowed

316
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,559
Petition the government alike

317
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,327
To break in the

318
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:09,983
An information trust in the same way that all of the railroads

319
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,263
Orchestrating

320
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,287
Prices in the 19

321
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:16,639
Without us getting too deeply down this road

322
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:19,455
I still don't think that there's a monopoly of

323
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:25,855
Access on the Internet or anything like that

324
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:33,791
Like we got investigate that you've got to do an investigation on that

325
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:37,119
Ask some question also hey Bill Maher

326
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,399
This is so fun

327
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,191
What happened to Lamar came out

328
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,471
Alex Jones

329
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,495
You should be able to speak

330
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,799
And have like he was a cute against out

331
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,175
Because our expense

332
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,855
There's human to die Austin live traffic

333
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,135
He speaks for the left

334
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:04,255
Now Bill Maher's coming out it's being like Alex Jones should have been kicked off step

335
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:08,351
Play Pandora

336
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:11,423
But

337
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,191
From the podcast

338
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,239
Find the episode on YouTube

339
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,639
Two of them

340
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,943
Two of them

341
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:29,087
With my Roundup of itself

342
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,671
Years ago has so there you go

343
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:36,767
I think I think we have some ideas about what you

344
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,559
Should be done with the

345
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:39,839
Website

346
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,119
Burn

347
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,167
Sort of

348
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,263
Information

349
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,031
Is a complexity

350
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:51,871
I don't know I never expected Alex to say something like this

351
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:55,967
We must stop this now by Congress.

352
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,759
Having any control over

353
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:29,247
At the end he was struggling so hard not to advocate for

354
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:32,831
Regulation the regulations

355
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:35,647
Replace them with regulations

356
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:41,279
Yeah and then

357
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,559
Did the congress shoot

358
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,095
Control the internet

359
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,119
Weird

360
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:49,471
Stupid were you so f****** stupid bizarre

361
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:52,799
Bafflingly confusing

362
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:56,895
Exactly what I was in I was in New Hampshire and I've heard I heard like

363
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:57,919
Four different people

364
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,455
People say Hey you know we don't have it

365
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,223
Sales tax

366
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,247
And then

367
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,783
Two sentences later they were like

368
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,343
I'm telling you man our roads are garbage

369
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,415
It's 121

370
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:15,583
Oh we're going to be sales tax but our income tax is through the roof

371
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:23,007
Play something new for us or anything really interesting

372
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,055
Your advocates

373
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,079
Doesn't make sense

374
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,871
But it is special

375
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:28,895
I hear something like this

376
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:29,919
Put your mic down

377
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:37,087
Let's talk about

378
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:43,487
The USA blue jeans as a kid remember

379
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:17,023
Hellyeah Hellyeah Diamond gusset

380
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:23,679
The first modern it's so great also there's another Diamond gusset commercial to Cabazon

381
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,983
It's the president of diamond

382
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:40,831
Does that mean

383
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:41,855
That

384
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,391
While we were listen

385
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,671
Sing to you the YouTube Rod

386
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,463
If you were listening

387
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,743
On the radio

388
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,279
You would have still heard

389
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:56,959
Local affiliate commercials if you're watching on

390
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,751
CBS Chicago

391
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,775
Here Local Chicago

392
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,055
I don't know.

393
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,847
I feel hear that

394
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:06,687
I don't think so I'm not entirely sure

395
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:09,503
But it's possible

396
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,623
Yeah that's what I'm say

397
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,159
Although your theory is

398
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:20,000
I don't know why they would have cheese dreams

399
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,304
I don't know

400
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,096
I don't know why they would have two streams

401
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,376
What do you mean

402
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:28,704
But this is what like where I got this from is one of the only places

403
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:29,984
That that audio comes

404
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,288
If he's not

405
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,080
Recording it to be released

406
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,616
To be released on YouTube

407
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:40,736
So now he's primary it is released but that's not his

408
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,272
That's not going that's not his

409
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,296
Primary audience

410
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,064
No

411
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,600
So if Direct

412
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,368
Streaming

413
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,928
To get to the the Millions

414
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,976
Then he's trying to get

415
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:51,744
As much G

416
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:55,072
Probably amplifies

417
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,864
As the amount of air time that the G

418
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,632
Commercial

419
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,936
Then I assume he gets

420
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,032
It's an interesting question to ask because

421
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,104
YouTube

422
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:11,968
Video that's up on YouTube that might not have

423
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,736
Have Diamond got the key

424
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,136
There's nothing to it

425
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,000
That's a bummer

426
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:30,144
Conspiracy theory and then all the sudden I come back with how they have the bizworks

427
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,496
You wasn't

428
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,264
Getting

429
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,080
Commercial

430
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:41,152
No cuz they're still local station

431
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,432
Things that have to have their own

432
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,712
Right right

433
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:44,992
Commercials

434
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,320
Blue Diamond

435
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:53,952
It's so good to hear those

436
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:54,720
Commercials

437
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,512
Wonderful

438
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,048
I do.

439
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,584
Even though

440
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,352
It's not just

441
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,120
The commercial

442
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,168
That

443
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,704
Me feel very weird about this

444
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:07,008
That is only one piece

445
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,080
But

446
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,896
Mother's Day

447
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,688
But I am

448
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,968
Alex Jones

449
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:16,736
Cries

450
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,040
Mission in America

451
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:27,488
Or you've been brought up

452
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,584
Glass 30 40 50 years in most schools

453
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,008
All of which should be here you'll fall history

454
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:47,200
You don't learn about the Trojan War

455
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:52,576
There's a deeper problem

456
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:55,136
Images of the Trojan War didn't happen

457
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,304
Little Teapot Road Reservoir

458
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:09,216
Like Heinrich schliemann found the city of Troy what has

459
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,496
Troy was

460
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:15,616
There was there was a destruction but it wasn't nearly the city

461
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:19,456
No good the homeric tradition of the Trojan War

462
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:22,784
Specifically just an allegory to talk about the Rage of Achilles

463
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,576
Is that is really all that is

464
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:29,696
It's more mythology going into it like that

465
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:30,976
So are you sure

466
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,512
I am out to saying people should

467
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:34,560
Sure

468
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:37,888
No

469
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:44,800
When they could be teaching fictional history

470
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,048
710 Freeway

471
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,352
I bet he even has a warped view of the fakir

472
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,888
Version of the Trojan War

473
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:12,448
Cuz I bet he just get that from

474
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,240
I'd love to talk

475
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,568
Is that Brad Pitt was

476
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:23,200
The mad

477
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,504
How do I

478
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:29,344
Not real fun about that

479
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,392
You really get down to it

480
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:34,720
The only reason that Achilles decided not to fight is

481
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,256
Because he had like

482
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,792
Concord a bunch of people

483
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:40,352
Stolen some women and then

484
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:43,424
Did the woman who had enslaved

485
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,776
I don't get the rapist

486
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:54,176
Ice cream look I am against all the the

487
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,992
But that is a reasonable position.

488
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,784
Like at the end of the day if that's

489
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,088
If you have to think of it as

490
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,624
Of their time

491
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,464
Turn up

492
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,864
Episode I would say a large portion of it

493
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:16,192
Coming out and saying America was never great

494
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,472
And we won't be great

495
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,240
Unless we

496
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,264
Deal with

497
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:22,080
Problems

498
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,104
Stereotypes

499
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:23,872
Some stuff like that

500
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:28,992
Stupid poorly worded, I think Cynthia Nixon had the best response to it was like

501
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:31,296
You have just tried to sound like a pro

502
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:34,112
You tried to sound like what you think Progressive sound like

503
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:37,440
And you failed yet

504
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,720
And your face

505
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:39,744
Better

506
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,536
It's amazing when you see the

507
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,304
These politicians

508
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,120
Haven't had to run for their office

509
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,400
For like 45 Alexa

510
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,424
Actions all the sudden

511
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,472
Like I'll just I'll just

512
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:54,336
I want back

513
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,664
Hey everybody a headache

514
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,688
Feel like a miracle

515
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:02,784
Suck a dick all the time right now

516
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:07,136
What are the wrestling world that's what's called

517
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:14,048
If you actually listen to

518
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,704
They are not cheery tomorrow night

519
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,288
Kind of response to it but later Alex represent

520
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,920
Struggles with this

521
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,200
Idea

522
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,248
Officially

523
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,784
I'm here is the beginning

524
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,744
For register.

525
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:48,608
America

526
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:55,776
German Russian Mexican

527
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:09,600
We go in five countries

528
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:17,536
So did you eat you were talking over to

529
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:22,144
We go in we fight all these wars and then we give the country's back people know what does that

530
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:22,912
Alex

531
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:26,240
Most of your career is based on complaining about Foreign Wars

532
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:32,128
Only relevant because of his AP interventionist

533
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:34,176
And pro weed Stanford

534
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,200
Despite the fact

535
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:37,248
What is a flaming racist

536
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:43,136
Publix Dempsey's whole thing

537
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:49,536
Even just a couple years ago he would be complaining about how we've gone into all these countries and we're still there

538
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:51,840
America

539
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:58,240
We go and solve problems elsewhere and then give the country back

540
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,520
Free that America's great

541
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:03,616
Disagree

542
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:04,640
It's nonsense

543
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,200
There's no reason

544
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:10,272
Is I don't know what point you're trying to make other than he

545
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:11,296
Efix Cuomo's

546
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:12,832
Which is fine

547
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:19,232
You can make that argument a different way you don't have to do this

548
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:23,328
My reaction to that videos just like

549
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,376
Come on man

550
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:27,680
It's one of those things I think I was doesn't have much you want

551
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,960
To talk about

552
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:29,728
Kentucky off on

553
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,776
But I think he's

554
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:36,896
He's in the weeds man like in terms of what

555
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:43,552
He's just versions of why America is great with that won the war thing which is

556
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,320
Against

557
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:48,928
Panama Canal

558
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:49,696
Lot of people

559
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:56,096
And then

560
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,448
We have building

561
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,472
Building

562
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:02,496
I think there's some other

563
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:08,896
Countries that have much more gorgeous buildings much more impressive building amazing the American build

564
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,176
Feelings are they

565
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:13,760
Centuries as we all know the greatest building

566
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:15,552
Of History

567
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,576
Thousands of you

568
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,744
Oh you were the American

569
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:31,936
Spirit

570
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:34,496
And then his other version is

571
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,264
Inventions

572
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,616
Sure we've invented some stuff

573
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,664
America is not in the top

574
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:48,064
Olympia or liquid

575
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,344
Embarrassed

576
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,112
Look

577
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,928
Whiskey that's all you need to know

578
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:53,696
Invented

579
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:56,000
Every pretty much everything

580
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,632
My response to that would be like

581
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:03,680
FairPoint about Cuomo

582
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:06,752
But everything else

583
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,544
Just talkingshit this is nonsense

584
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,104
And that's not even getting into the nuances like

585
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,128
The parts of America

586
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,664
History of data are terrible

587
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,480
You're not a good country

588
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:19,296
For a lot of business

589
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:20,576
Slavery

590
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:23,392
Seaweed

591
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:34,656
Invisible

592
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:36,448
I'll do that one thing I do

593
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,240
Is it

594
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:45,920
No I didn't he says them aren't really

595
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,456
Worth it for a clip

596
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:49,760
About betas here a little bit

597
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,856
Brian stelter.

598
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,584
Would probably be hunted

599
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,912
Crosshair

600
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,568
My alarms

601
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,592
Red heart

602
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:20,736
Paula White

603
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:23,040
Always getting stronger

604
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,256
With love in my heart and my eyes

605
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,304
Play supporters will be right back

606
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,352
That wasn't bad

607
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:38,656
Is it is what it is

608
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:42,240
I find that far more refreshing

609
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,776
That was a genuine like

610
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:45,056
Please support us not like

611
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,712
There's another Trend that I'm seeing here

612
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,040
Steven controller

613
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:58,880
That's not the best example

614
00:32:59,136 --> 00:32:59,648
Coming up later

615
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:03,488
But he on this episode that I listen to vibrate

616
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,024
At least six times

617
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:10,144
Shut off in the middle of sentences by the bridge

618
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,192
You have to be

619
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,472
Working on a

620
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:16,800
Who's that's my presumption

621
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:17,824
It doesn't make sense

622
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:20,384
Like you so full of passion that he's missing

623
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:25,760
Know if he's resting on the radio

624
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:26,784
It's B he's not in can

625
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,832
Control anymore Genesis Communications

626
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,112
Work is now in control

627
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,392
I believe that

628
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,416
Seated that sword

629
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,696
Back to them

630
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,720
Where is he

631
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:35,488
In control

632
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,560
That's my working on it

633
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:41,376
But it's so glaring

634
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:42,400
Not

635
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,424
Because he would have

636
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,728
You saw the build-up going on now

637
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:49,824
I crawl and I grow stronger even though I'm getting weaker

638
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,104
Bleeding up

639
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:57,760
A

640
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:58,528
Pig sounds like

641
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,808
F*** I got a second

642
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,112
That's what I think Auntie can't

643
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,392
Skip a break

644
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,672
Yeah anymore

645
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:06,464
Why can't I believe

646
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,256
But he's lost some control of his own show

647
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:09,792
That's my working

648
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:11,584
He's falling apart

649
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:15,936
Yep and I think the diamond gusset thing is a nice thing for us to see

650
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:16,960
Here in the

651
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:18,496
In that ice

652
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:19,776
We are seeing

653
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:21,056
Somewhat of

654
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:23,360
Version

655
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:25,152
To The Pact

656
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,200
Like

657
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:28,736
This is on the pot

658
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,016
Yeah

659
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:32,320
So he's just releasing the live radio

660
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,088
Yeah

661
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:37,184
You think that he would have figured out that you can edit

662
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:39,744
Your own ads into the into a podcast

663
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,560
You would think that and that is actually part of my

664
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:45,632
Consideration of why I I wonder

665
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:46,400
About

666
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,472
You know that's part of why I'm

667
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,264
I don't know

668
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,032
I don't know what to say

669
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,056
About that

670
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,944
Alex

671
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:01,760
Mode

672
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,808
I don't think it's true but

673
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,600
It's one of those things you probably shouldn't say on

674
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:08,928
I'm out here

675
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,280
Long time

676
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:20,192
I have videos and articles at all

677
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:27,104
Michelle

678
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:34,016
People shooting home Intruders

679
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:41,952
Incredible

680
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,304
Is that

681
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,144
That's Entertainment is that a no I think

682
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,240
Extra is Mark McGrath talking about people

683
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:01,408
What

684
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:03,712
What is a psychopath

685
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:10,112
Crazy videos

686
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,160
Sound effects over at

687
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:15,488
It's like that

688
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:20,864
Like that's what I'm stealing from Alex is the guy was like

689
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:24,448
Yeah but then the other part that I think is really fun is like

690
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,664
I think we would all like that

691
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,736
Forum

692
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:39,808
I don't know what I'm doing or with real

693
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:42,624
Go to bed

694
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,976
Go to bed

695
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:47,744
I like it

696
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,024
Enjoy

697
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,376
Big

698
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:55,424
A big narratives that has throughout this

699
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,984
It's a little bit trouble

700
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,056
Inasmuch as it is based on a real story

701
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:03,360
Alex is a terrible job covering it

702
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,896
I will do my best

703
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:05,920
To pick up the pieces

704
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,200
After he's done with

705
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:11,808
But just like you lyrics

706
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:15,136
San Francisco

707
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:17,440
You are the daughter father's arms

708
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,976
Just real quick and Kacy black

709
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,256
Haven't heard the episode work

710
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:23,328
About that because gun misfired it ricocheted off

711
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:24,352
The ground and shot her

712
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:26,400
Charged

713
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:28,192
With murder because it was

714
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,264
Yeah once again the issue was the gun not the

715
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:34,336
Masterbat

716
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,360
Is that he was

717
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:41,760
Mexican

718
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:42,528
Talk about it

719
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:44,832
He wouldn't talk about it probably wouldn't talk about it

720
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:47,392
You probably leave it alone

721
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,160
Since Bureau

An underground tunnel

727

Who died in the ritual

728
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,512
For the local liberal government

729
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:27,328
Thousands of ton

730
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:31,424
Bulldozer to cover

731
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,448
The compound

732
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:39,104
He would not be in jail if a dead three-year-old

733
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:47,296
Releasing

734
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,088

00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:53,952
$2,000 Bond

736

No money pay

Cash Bond

738
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:02,912
Respond to one of the points

739
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,192
Before we get into the

740
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,216
Over there

741
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,056
The idea that they're covering it up with sand and whatever

742
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:12,128
It's someone else's property was on

743
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:17,248
Is there choice

744
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,528
This been going on

745
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:19,552
The beginning of August

746
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:21,600
Uhealth done everything that they need to do

747
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:22,624
The physical location

748
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,672
Like there's anything

749
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,696
Myth

750
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:29,792
So the idea is not that they're there. Whitewashing something covering it up

751
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,072
This guy's proper

752
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,608
It's someone else's property

753
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:34,656
Breaking news

754
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:40,288
So this is an issue where there was

755
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,592
A group of Muslims

756
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,872
Who had a compound

757
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:44,640
Next

758
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:48,224
Was allegedly being used

759
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:48,992
Gets out of

760
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:49,760
Shoe weapons

761
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:53,600
Who died

762
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,696
That were being done because they thought

763
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,720
You would become the

764
00:39:59,232 --> 00:39:59,744

766
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,048
If they were right

767
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,352
From the CNN articles

768
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:10,752
Give you a little bit of a context of what this story is about and then we're going to talk a little bit more about the

769
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:17,664
The family fled Georgia for compound in New Mexico where they train their children and firearm

770
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:24,320
His father's hand

771
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:27,136
11 more malnourished children were later found on the proper

772
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:33,024
Family believed that once the demons were gone the boy would return as Jesus four months later and tell this family which

773
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,304
Get rid of

774
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,072
Eyewitness

775
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:40,704
Those who did not believe their message would be killed or detained until they believe the teenager on the compound set

776
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:42,240
According to an FBI

777
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,288
There's no evidence that they killed anybody

778
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,848
But all of them are charged with 11 counts

779
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:47,872
Child

780
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:51,712
It's being dealt with as

781
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:54,016
Very serious issue

782
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,600
Exactly what happened

783
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:58,368
And with my

784
00:40:58,624 --> 00:40:59,904
Terrance Caldwell

785
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:00,928
And it was a

786
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:01,696
Christian

787
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:03,488
Hold on to that talk

788
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:06,304
Backroads

789
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:10,144
Militant

790
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:10,912
Islamic

791
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,448
Group or Muslim group

792
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:17,312
Call the local sheriff called The Suspect extremists of the Muslim belief

793
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:20,384
He later said that his statement was based on their appearance

794
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,688
I need it not want to imply violence

795
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:27,296
So does every idea or the kernel of where that came from

796
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:29,856
Is from physical up

797
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:32,416
Mexican

798
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,488
There are children

799
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,024
Mistreated there

800
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:37,792
Absolutely

801
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:41,376
There were children who were reported missing in other states

802
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:42,656
Who were they are

803
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:45,472
It's not clear whether it was parental kidnapping

804
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:46,240
Or

805
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:49,312
Or something along those lines there's a little bit of murkiness to that

806
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,616
I don't care to unpacking

807
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:53,663
Entirely

808
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:55,455
So from the judge quote

809
00:41:55,967 --> 00:42:01,855
The state alleges that there was a big plan afoot but the state has not shown to my satisfaction by clear and convincing evidence

810
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:02,879
What impact factor

811
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:03,647
Plan what

812
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,183
Thought Judge Sarah Backus

813
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:08,255
The state wants me to make a leap and it's a large

814
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:11,839
And that would be to hold people in jail without bond based on again

815
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:12,863
Troubling fact

816
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:16,447
But I didn't hear any Kuwait plan that was being alleged by the state

817
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:19,775
This is a response

818
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,055
I don't

819
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:27,455
See evidence of the assertion that are being made namely that they were training kids to be

820
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:31,295
Warriors of some sort of the accusations

821
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:32,831
Of the prosecution was

822
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:35,391
They are teaching them to school shooting

823
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:39,231
And that was why they would be the rest of the public

824
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,511
What's right

825
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:45,375
So you're going to have to have some actual evidence it's almost like the burden of proof is

826
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:51,007
I believe the judge was

827
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:52,799
Clearly

828
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:53,823
Presented proof of

829
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:57,407
These things for I'm not sure that it would be appropriate

830
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:59,711
Based on troubling fact

831
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:02,271
Anything other than a child

832
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:04,063
Yeah so

833
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:06,111
Alex is entirely ranting

834
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,135
Just about the state

835
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,159
Grenade by the

836
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:09,183
The defense attorney

837
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:11,487
Whose job it is to defend their client

838
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:16,607
Well we shouldn't have those things like quote if these were white people of a Christian

839
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:20,703
That's not a big deal because there's a Second Amendment right

840
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:21,471
On firearms

841
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,519
If these were white Christian

842
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:24,543
Faith healing is

843
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:25,311
No

844
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,847
Because we have freedom of religion

845
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:30,687
But they look different and worship differently from the rest of us

846
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:31,967
Thomas Clark said bunt

847
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,015
So the argument that

848
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:37,855
Alex is responding to in claiming that the liberal government is making

849
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:46,303
Like bring all stuff in

850
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,119
Whose job it is to

851
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:49,887
To come up with

852
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:51,679
And you are correct

853
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:52,703
IPic

854
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:54,751
I think there's something to it

855
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:55,775
So

856
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,311
Here's the thing

857
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:01,151
Three-year-old abdulghani wahhaj died at the compound

858
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:03,455
Is absolutely the result

859
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,479
A very least

860
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:05,503
Criminal neck

861
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:09,087
The boy suffered from seizures requiring constant

862
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:10,367
Caring medical attention

863
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:11,903
His mother hekkema Ramsey

864
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:13,439
Previously told CNN

865
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:17,791
A trip to Saudi Arabia in October 2017 siraj wahhaj

866
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:18,815
That's funny

867
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:22,655
Siraj wahhaj

868
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,447
You said you wanted to

869
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:27,519
Stop giving us on medication and perform rituals

870
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:28,799
Demonic spirits out of

871
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,871
This is not really too far off from Alex

872
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,663
Distrust of psychiatric medication

873
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:35,711
Is demonization of vaccines

874
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:37,247
His belief in literal demon

875
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,039
These are people who largely

876
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:40,575
Just took Alex Jones

877
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:41,599
Put them into action

878
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:42,879
Now

879
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:43,903
Why that's important

880
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:44,671
Is because

881
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:45,951
Oftentimes

882
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:47,231
A dead kid

883
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,791
Is the result of the things Alex Jones believes

884
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:52,863
Yep in terms of don't trust medicine

885
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:54,399
Now back to your

886
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:56,703
From The Washington Post

887
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:00,031
Nearly one-third of the roughly 600 gravesite

888
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:02,591
Peaceful Valley Cemetery belong to a child

889
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:11,295

Delia believe the definition of God the corner and autopsy report

892
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:23,583
Former church members childhood memories of children needlessly dying

893
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,119
From lack of Medical Care

Bruce Wingate founder of protect Idaho kids Foundation

895
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:32,287
For children will die this year in Idaho alone

896
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:34,847
If lawmakers fail to lift the state's faith-healing these

Linda Martin

Former church member and retired Lane County Barber

899

Followers of Christ members issue birth control

Normally give birth at home infrequently Fargo prenatal care

901
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:48,671
Homeschool children go without birth

902
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:49,695
Making efforts

903
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:50,975
Subtract faith-healing deaths

904
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:56,095
The cultural rituals of the church compound the problems at Canyon County Sheriff

Kieran Donahue

906
00:45:57,631 --> 00:46:00,959
He said followers have not always alerted authorities after a death

907
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:04,799
When deputies are called off and they find bodies moved washed and redress

908
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:07,359
And dozens of church members Milling about the house of the

Martin said that after Oregon remove spiritual healing as a

The defense in 2011

911
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:17,343
Some followers of Christ church members moved to Idaho to escape scrutiny of their religious practices

912
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:21,183
Some people look at the Bible as applicable law

00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:29,375
Is also the Independent to Western Co

918
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:31,935
They don't like government telling them what to do

919
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:36,287
There is this feeling the parental rights are absolute

920
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,823
Religious freedom rights are at

921
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:40,127
According to the National Institute

922
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:42,431
Health and the journal Pediatrics quote

923
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:47,551
75 and 1995 172 children died following stealing

924
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:49,343
140 of them

925
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,159
From easily curable or treatable medical condition

926
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:53,439
In one case

927
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:55,487
A two-year-old girl choked on a banana

928
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:58,303
And showed Signs of Life for an hour before dying

929
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,071
Father parents

930
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:00,095
And other adults

Prayed

932
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:04,447
So the issue is that

933
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:13,663
It's not a real issue and I think these people did some really f***** up stuff

934
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:14,431
But

935
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:15,711
Some sort of like a

936
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:19,295
Terrorist training ground

937
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:20,575
Islamic

938
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:22,111
Faith followed

939
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:23,647
Is cockamamie bulshit

940
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:26,463
But even you said as we were starting it fit in your

941
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:27,487
Community

942
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,279
Do you grow up in

943
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:31,071
That this was something that happened

944
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:37,471
I don't know if that's

945
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:40,031
Really want

946
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:42,335
Taken care of

947
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:45,663
Watch YouTube.

948
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:46,687
They did not

949
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:51,807
They do not do anything other than murder a child

950
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:54,879
Well they've murdered that Chelsea years the property

951
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:57,183
Killed him this is where we get back to the least

952
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:59,487
Institute and the libertarian ideology

953
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:01,535
Because they don't believe that there is a

954
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:03,839
In affirmative

955
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:10,239
Obligation that you have to give Your Children Healthcare

956
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,519
Are negative consequence

957
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:12,543
You don't

958
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:14,847
Which is stupid

959
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:16,127
Twisted

960
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:17,919
Idea that you would

961
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:18,943
Rather watch

962
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:20,223
Child died

963
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:21,503
God's will ever

964
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:22,271
Everett

965
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,039
Accept metal

966
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,063
God will

967
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,855
It's your weakness

968
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:28,415
Same to me

969
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:33,023
That's true

970
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,303
Isn't like maneuver

971
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:37,631
Maneuvers hates

972
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:44,287
The Valhalla what's the one where you

973
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:45,311
Valsalva

974
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:47,615
The valsalva maneuver

975
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:54,271
Who killed upwards of two people than someone who sat around and watched

976
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:57,087
My two-year-old girl choked on a banana

977
00:48:57,343 --> 00:49:00,415
I think the murderer

978
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:11,423
Slow in covering up the entire side

979
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:18,591
I mean I still think he was a f*****-up person but I can't imagine the level of f***** up you have to be to see a child

980
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:19,615
Who is like

981
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:20,383
Struggling

982
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:21,919
Friend hour

983
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:25,503
Choking on something easily dislodged from their throat

984
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:27,039
Well if they die they die

985
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:29,343
And then they go suck.

986
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,367
Move on

987
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:33,439
Understandably

988
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:35,487
Yeah so anyway

989
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:36,511
I don't want to go.

990
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:38,559
And also I should

991
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:40,607
Play with this is still developing

992
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:44,703
Yeah yeah

993
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:45,727
Was

994
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:47,519
Because they don't pose

995
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,543
Threat to society

996
00:49:57,759 --> 00:50:02,879
Is mad about this idea that the judge let them go the reason is because

997
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:09,791
The state did not do a good enough job of proving the

998
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:13,887
You must let them go

999
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:17,215
So Alex if you believe in the rule of law you have to believe in that

1000
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:18,239
Unfortunately

1001
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:19,775
You have different

1002
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:21,567
Standards for white and brown

1003
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:22,847
You

1004
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,895
Or only mad about this because

1005
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:27,711
Enjoy

1006
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:29,247
Which is

1007
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:31,039
Inexplicably

1008
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:32,063
He brings up

1009
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:40,255
Well you would

1010
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,791
Be talking about it if

1011
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:43,071
Was a white family

1012
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:46,399
You got plenty of options to talk about white families

1013
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:47,679
Homeschooling their kids

1014
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:50,495
Teaching them how to shoot guns and then watching them die

1015
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:52,287
You got so many stories

1016
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,103
In the white

1017
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:59,711
Community

1018
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:08,159
Garita a little bit of this article quote

1019
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:14,047
The parents of a baby girl who died because she didn't receive medical attention in favor of Faith healing took a plea deal

1020
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:19,167
Travis and Sarah Mitchell criminal negligent homicide

1021
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:19,935
John Foote

1022
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:20,959
District attorney for

1023
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:22,751
Clackamas County

1024
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:23,775
So I mean

1025
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:27,359
Exactly the same thing

1026
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:28,895
I mean they're going to jail

1027
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:33,247
I don't like you described him as a nice white couple facetiously

1028
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:37,343
Alex Jones

1029
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:39,903
But

1030
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:42,719
Congratulations Alex

1031
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:46,303
Harkening back to his

1032
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:50,911
We still get to keep that tapered of Muslims because that's become so

1033
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:51,935
Keto

1034
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:53,215
What do we got to do to

1035
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:55,263
People that religion

1036
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:56,543
I do I did

1037
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:59,103
Unfortunately

1038
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:00,127
I don't know

1039
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:01,151
I don't know

1040
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:08,319
Now he's back on

1041
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:12,671
Eggs

1042
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:14,207
Oh boy I'll tell you what

1043
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:16,511
Tell you what

1044
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:17,535
This is

1045
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:18,559
Disgusting

1046
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:20,095
Is it real

1047
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,399
We will reach

1048
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,679
Greatness

1049
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:25,727
When discrimination

1050
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:32,127
And stereotyping against women 51% of our population

1051
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:57,983
Long big wave app again

1052
00:52:58,239 --> 00:52:59,775
Commercial break

1053
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:04,127
Completely caught off guard by lost in that

1054
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:11,039
Too close to your Bernie Sanders if I could be honest

1055
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:14,623
Offensive to mentally handicapped

1056
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:21,023
You know why cuz it was Bernie Sanders played on like 3/4

1057
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:25,631
And the Chipmunks too far

1058
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:30,495
That's

1059
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,031
Touch

1060
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:35,103
Not nearly as bad as what happened

1061
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:42,015
There is a war on

1062
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:51,999
I like for a while I love to imagine

1063
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:57,887
He was doing that through the entire house

1064
00:53:58,143 --> 00:54:00,703
Imagine that he had at least one stop

1065
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:05,567
So is that a girl

1066
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:11,711
Identity three characters for him I don't know

1067
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:13,759
Elizabeth Warren

1068
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:22,463
Weirdos weird

1069
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:26,815
Pretending that the audience

1070
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:35,007
Chipotle word nonplussed

1071
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:42,687
Ford.com

1072
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:54,719
My wife

1073
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:59,071
I don't have a job to I was 40 years old government

1074
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:01,631
Job

1075
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:05,471
Are we this is Ruth Bader Ginsburg impressions

1076
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:11,871
Volume

1077
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:25,951
Or you

1078
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:36,703
That's great

1079
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:08,191
In the middle of the character by Dido that goes on even longer but

1080
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:11,519
Because he's not good at making

1081
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:15,359
Can points and juxtaposing in the same character voice

1082
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:17,663
Supposing is this stupid guy

1083
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:22,527
He brings his narrative about why Muslims are bad to women

1084
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:27,391
And then bring the mirror

1085
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:31,487
Did you graduate college

1086
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:36,607
Will you do all one or all the other have it both ways

1087
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:38,911
Because if it's all the things that America is

1088
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:40,447
Great about for women

1089
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:41,727
Then it's

1090
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:45,055
But if it

1091
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:48,639
See all the things that Muslims do that are bad

1092
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:50,431
Conception

1093
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:57,599
Colleges are there to brainwash

1094
00:56:58,111 --> 00:57:00,415
World

1095
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:01,951
It does

1096
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:05,535
Interesting things on

1097
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:08,351
Yeah there's a lot going on there because he does

1098
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:09,631
Credit countries

1099
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:11,935
For having like a lot of women to go to college in deposit

1100
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:17,823
Let's go to college

1101
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:19,615
Yeah there's a lot of

1102
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:21,663
You scratch right below the surface and

1103
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:23,967
But none of this makes sense

1104
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:25,759
I don't know who

1105
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:27,807
Exactly that voices

1106
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:29,599
Defensive to other than like

1107
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:31,647
Eight or nine different groups

1108
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:32,671
Whoops Pacific

1109
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:33,951
People Cuomo

Ruth Bader Ginsburg

1111
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:42,655
I'm going to go with

1112
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:47,263
Anybody

1113
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:58,783
Anybody anybody that doesn't speak English

1114
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:01,343
New Yorkers for New Yorkers

1115
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:04,415
Captive cord

1116
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:10,815
I'm offended in the same way that

1117
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:12,607
But

1118
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:13,887
Is he doing great burning

1119
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,543
I have to go to though

1120
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:22,847
Alex

1121
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:24,127
Lies a whole bunch

1122
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:28,479
About things are going on

1123
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:36,927
Nautical

Infowars.com

1125
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:43,327
Prosecutors have reached an all-time low

1126
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:46,655
Official government

1127
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:51,775
Number people

1128
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:59,199

Quarterback to the acid attacks in

1130
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:06,111
Really reasonable

1131
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:06,879
We can get around

1132
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:09,695
One of them is

1133
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:10,463
Repeat offenders

1134

Factory

1135

They're dealing with less people in there are more crime

1136
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:18,399
You can do with that

1137
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:22,239
Also in the last couple of years in the United Kingdom

1138
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:23,007
Do Dilaudid

1139
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:24,799

For the police

1141
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:26,847
Emma's light to

1142
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:27,871
Horizon

1143
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:29,407
In reported crime

1144
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:33,759
That we're going unreported before

1145
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:36,831
In reported crimes that necessarily weren't all getting salt

1146
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:40,927
Right if you look at it in terms of the United States you probably see very similar trend

1147
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:42,207
In terms of

1148
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:45,023
We've had Criminal

1149
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:47,327
Reformed police officer

1150
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:49,119
Administrative reform

1151
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:53,215
How many times have you seen in the past

1152
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:56,031
Letting a sex worker gets murdered

1153
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:57,055
And they just

1154
00:59:57,311 --> 01:00:03,455
They say it's a suicide or something like that so they don't have to investigator into it doesn't work with her like

1155
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:07,551
Instituted the

1156
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:09,855
Policy or whatever

1157
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:12,415
Police

1158
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:13,439
Forces indifference

1159
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,719
Said he's had to now like

1160
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:15,487
Keep record of their

1161
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:20,607
This whole thing

1162
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:21,631
And rather than

1163
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:25,727
They just wear like Willits cheapest

1164
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:27,775
Quota buster

1165
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:31,359
She said

1166
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:32,895
Send a text of starch

1167
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:35,967
A common narrative

1168
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:38,527
Like it

1169
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:40,575
Consistent through Alex Jones

1170
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:41,599
Tommy Robinson

1171
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:42,623
Olive

1172
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:44,927
These people they always talk about

1173
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:46,719
If so

1174
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:47,487
F******

1175
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:48,511
Regular

1176
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:51,327
I've never really done too much looking into it I was

1177
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:53,119
Assume that there are overinflated

1178
01:00:57,727 --> 01:00:58,239
But

1179
01:00:58,751 --> 01:00:59,263
From the BBC

1180
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:02,079
There's a common understanding of acid attacks

1181
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:03,871
UK to go something like this

1182
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:05,919
Charisma

1183
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:07,199
Both are South Asian

1184
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:09,759
And I should point out here I looked into like

1185
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:10,783
Official UK

1186
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:11,551
A statistic

1187
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:14,879
Asian tourist

1188
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:16,927
Categories that include Middle East

1189
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:20,767
Right they don't have a separate category for Middle Eastern that I have black

1190
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:23,071
Which includes African and Caribbean

1191
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:25,887
European

1192
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:29,727
Asian ant mix

1193
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:34,079
Those are the categories that they have in terms of official record-keeping

1194
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:36,383
The conversation that needs to be had but not

1195
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:41,503
I didn't I wasn't by the fact that those with categories

1196
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:46,111
Sister but I don't run the UK

1197
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:49,695
No I don't think the base for on ethnicity

1198
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:53,791
So understanding

1199
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:57,119
Gmail

1200
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:59,679
And the violence has something to do with the so-called on

1201
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:02,751
Distance released by London Metropolitan Police

1202
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:05,823
The BBC provide a breakdown of every recorded acid attack

1203
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:06,591
Over 50

1204
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:09,407
Senior. Buy a gender ethnicity Borough

1205
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:10,687
Hate crime and outcome

1206
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:13,503
This is the fullest picture yet of the capitals

1207
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:14,271
Suspect

1208
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:15,039
And victims

1209
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:17,087
Here are the stats that it shows

1210
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:19,903
The Suspect with mail 74%

1211
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:21,951
The time and the victim was male

1212
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:23,487
67% of the time

1213
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:26,559
With only one attack ever being related to the idea of

1214
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:30,655
Regions of the world most attacks related genders

01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:35,007
Survivors Trust

1217
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:35,775
International

1218
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:37,823
Often linked to reject

1219
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:39,615
Sexual advances or marriage proposal

1220
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:42,175
However this does not appear to be the case in the United

1221
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:46,015
Acid attacks are on the rise in the UK though so what's causing it

1222
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:49,343
This is likely to be related to a rise in moped

1223
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:51,391
According to dr. Simon Harding

1224
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:53,695
Associate professor of criminology at the University

1225
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:54,463
3 West London

1226
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:55,999
He goes on to say quote

1227
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:59,071
We've had acid throwing in this country for over 200 years

1228
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:01,631
And there's been a new development of it's at dr. Harding

1229
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:03,935
But it's not new and it's not important

1230
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:08,287
So it's just a phenomenon that apparently is a part of London crime

1231
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:09,823
English crime

1232
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:11,359
That is sort of

1233
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:13,151
To our ideas as

1234
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:14,687
Is something that's very common

1235
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:18,271
To America

1236
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:22,623
Almost like that

1237
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:25,183
Like a certain point it becomes a thing that

1238
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:26,463
Somebody

1239
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:28,255
And then it becomes an option

1240
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:30,047
For so many other people

1241
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:31,327
To take

1242
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:33,887
Sherp like

1243
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:34,911
And it's like a fat

1244
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:40,031
Well I mean like

1245
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:44,127
Is the is my point there

1246
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:45,663
From the data was able to find

1247
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:48,735
Tickets Knotts

1248
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,015
Overblown

1249
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:53,087
But the number of people who end up getting

1250
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:53,855
Not nothing

1251
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:55,391
It's weird

1252
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:03,327
Everybody all the time

1253
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,375
It's weird but also that you see

1254
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:07,935
Be here there be mail 67

1255
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:09,471
The time is pretty counter

1256
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:16,383
The Narrative right there

1257
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:17,151
Propaganda

1258
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:20,991
And the fact that it's not a uniquely as the British

1259
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:22,783
Categorize it

1260
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:24,575
Yeah

1261
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:26,879
Should give some pause and make you think like

1262
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:28,671
This is there's a difference

1263
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:30,719
Story that you can tell here that's interesting

1264
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:32,255
Look at ass away from

1265
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:36,863
It's not so much like the Muslims are running a bucket jumping acetone

1266
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:38,655
Which is what I was

1267
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:41,471
Because that makes them into a Batman

1268
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:43,519
Think I can't visualize this

1269
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:46,335
Is any other way now then like a bunch of guys

1270
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,871
Riding on mopeds

1271
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:48,895
With a pot

1272
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:51,455
It's filled with acid

1273
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:52,991
Either that or now I see

1274
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:54,015
Squirt bottle

1275
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:57,343
You know like a l I thought you might like a super soaker

1276
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:58,879
Yes

1277
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:00,927
Super Soaker

1278
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:02,975
Reinforced

1279
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:03,999
2%

1280
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:09,631
Isaac version of with probably a horrible reaction

1281
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:17,311
Let's just feel this once more about sound

1282
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:21,663
Solid dude

1283
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:27,551
It's due.

1284
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:28,575
Too many dudes

1285
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:35,487
This is another thing that always brings up because control

1286
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:36,511
Find a way to Savage

1287
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:38,303
District

1288
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:42,655
UK include knives broken bottles sharp objects

1289
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:43,679
Right

1290
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:47,775
I should note that the HBO series sharp objects

1291
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:48,799
Caswell and

1292
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:50,079
You killed anyone with a D

1293
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:53,407
The nuts in there too

1294
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:59,551
Blu-ray

1295
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:02,879
According to official data from the UK

1296
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:04,159
27

1297
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:06,207
Knife related assault

1298
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:08,255
But put things in context the 27th

1299
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:09,023
Numbers

1300
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:11,071
Higher than the level

1301
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:12,095
In 2010

1302
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:13,119
2011

1303
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:19,007
Further the rise for 2015 to 2017 code directly related with improvements police made in

1304
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:22,591
That is another issue where you see an UPS

1305
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:25,151
You can make a lot out of it if you want to

1306
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:27,967
But if you get to the root of it you look for explanation

1307
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:29,247
What'd you find

1308
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:30,271
Is that

1309
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:31,807
That's why there are more

1310
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:32,575
Right

1311
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:38,719
7 years ago is almost the same as now

1312
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:45,119
Came back up

1313
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:48,191
Then you have to explain why was it that high in 2011

1314
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:51,007
Is it possible that there were deficient

1315
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:52,543
Season reporting that happened

1316
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:54,079
Over the last couple years

1317
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:02,015
Interesting late there were 200

1318
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:04,063
M16 knife related homicide

1319
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:05,855
UK during the year 20

1320
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:07,135
2017

1321
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:09,183
How many gun deaths were there in the

1322
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:12,511
But that

1323
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:14,047
But number

1324
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:15,583
The 250

1325
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:16,863
Knife related homicides

1326
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:17,887
Netgear

1327
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:18,911
Alex Price

1328
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:20,959
Representatives like there's a giant UPS

1329
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:25,567
Murder at 12

1330
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:27,103
There were 12 more

1331
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:30,687
Entire knife violence

1332
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:33,503
Alright

1333
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:34,783
Homicides is like

1334
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:35,551
4

1335
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:36,319
Well

1336
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:38,623
So there's 215 22

1337
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:39,647
16 to 27

1338
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:41,951
Yeah it's only two more than there was

1339
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:42,975
From 2015

1340
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:44,767
There isn't

1341
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:45,791
Really

1342
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:46,815
Increase

1343
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:48,351
Substantiv increase

1344
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:49,375
Cindy's crime

1345
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:51,679
There's only you can sort of cheese

1346
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:52,447
Distance from

1347
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:53,727
Come up with your own explanation

1348
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:57,055
And that is way

1349
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:59,103
Way more intimidating than

1350
01:07:59,359 --> 01:07:59,871
Actual

1351
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:03,199
Something like all all night

1352
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:03,967
Attack

1353
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:06,783
They're up like 20%

1354
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:10,367
Wrightwood again a lot of that could be attributed to specific

1355
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:11,903
Recording

1356
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:15,231
So some of that can be taken away from that some of that candy

1357
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:16,511
Just be considered

1358
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:17,535
Perhaps

1359
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:20,095
There's a certain amount of it

1360
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:21,119
Basically irrelevant

1361
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:22,655
So you take away

1362
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:23,935
No some of that person

1363
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:25,215
Mnu taken

1364
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:28,031
Look out that it's not just Muslims that are stabbing people right

1365
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:29,311
Generally speaking

1366
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:30,591
Dudes dudes

1367
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:32,127
And then also

1368
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:34,687
I mean statistically

1369
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:36,223
We have the same issues here

1370
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:39,551
The stats that you can get about offenders

1371
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:41,087
Are generally

1372
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:42,879
Who got arrested for things

1373
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:44,415
Right

1374
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:45,695
The higher incidence

1375
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:48,255
So

1376
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:49,279
You know it's

1377
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:50,559
Kind of tough.

1378
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:52,351
To figure out what the actual story

1379
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:55,423
But from all the statistics that are available

1380
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:57,215
It's not as big of a like

1381
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:00,031
Wave of knives

1382
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:02,847
All over England here's another issue

1383
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:11,039
That's all that's all propaganda find a way to make Knives Out of acid work

1384
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:13,599
Here's another

1385
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:17,695
When you use 6% in America

1386
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:20,255
Gun violence

1387
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:22,047
America that means there's

1388
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:25,375
4000 more incidents

1389
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:29,727
In England as you pointed out in gun

1390
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:31,775
2%

1391
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:32,543
Is

1392
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:33,311
To do

1393
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:39,711
Like that's the kind of a homicide

1394
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:41,503
Because we're so used to

1395
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:42,527
So much bile

1396
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:45,087
Small percentage

1397
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:49,183
To us means so much more

1398
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:51,743
Also just put things in a little bit of a broader perspective

1399
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:53,791
215 knife related homicides

1400
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:55,583
In the same year there were hundreds

1401
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:57,119
16 that were just people got be

1402
01:09:57,887 --> 01:10:00,703
934 strangulation

1403
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:01,471
Or

1404
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:03,263
Edward Browning murder

1405
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:04,799
Maps

1406
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:06,335
Like what kind

1407
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:07,359
Explain

1408
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:13,759
I don't know the

1409
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:15,295
And actually it might be too

1410
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:16,831
It's 204

1411
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:17,855
I didn't write that one down

1412
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:19,391
Anyway

1413
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:22,975
If you drown somebody

1414
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:23,999
There's a certain amount of

1415
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:24,767
Respect I have

1416
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:26,047
There it is

1417
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:27,583
Ineffective

1418
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:30,655
Inefficient murder

1419
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:36,543
A lot of stabs or like a really good staff

1420
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:40,383
Received very consistent thing in Alex and terms

1421
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:42,943
Supplying and missing the forest for the trees in order to

1422
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:44,479
To demonize minorities

1423
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:45,503
Expensive

1424
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:46,783
Glorifying

1425
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:49,599
White people steal more

1426
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:53,951
So now we see these newer things

1427
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:55,487
Like

1428
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:58,815
If not being able to time his brakes

1429
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:02,143
Right we see Genesis Communications ads coming in

1430
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:03,423
And whatever the case is

1431
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:04,447
Isn't that whatever

1432
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:05,983
This next clip

1433
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:07,263
Is where I was like

1434
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:08,799
Alex's becoming his

1435
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:09,567
His past self

1436
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:12,127
Okay no way

1437
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:13,407
Did anybody who listen

1438
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:15,711
What year is that

1439
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:16,479
And not be like

1440
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:18,015
Visitin 28

1441
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:19,295
What the f***

1442
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:32,863
Of the information War Alex Jones

1443
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:38,495
Merle Haggard

1444
01:11:57,183 --> 01:12:03,327
Distilling whiskey

1445
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:09,727
Chrono

1446
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:29,951
You love to sing along with us

1447
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:32,511
Music

1448
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:34,303
Bruce Willis

1449
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:36,351
What was the name of that movie

1450
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:40,447
The one with mr. glass

1451
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:51,967
Send the news no news no news

1452
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:52,991
It's crazy

1453
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:55,551
He's been doing this for a decade

1454
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:00,671
Cuz I'm listening to the feet

1455
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:02,719
It's right that is very different

1456
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:07,327
Yeah I'm not just creating something

1457
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:11,679
I have not heard him sing along like that since the episodes that were listening to

1458
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:13,215
I think Alex Jones

1459
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:14,239
Getting like

1460
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:16,287
I think you might be starting to come to terms with

1461
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:17,055
The fact that like

1462
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:20,639
He's back on his own Hunter I'm going to I'm going to be

1463
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:22,943
What I was again

1464
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:28,063
The best case scenario I'm going to be back to where I was 10 years ago

1465
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:29,599
And that's why even Pancho and Lefty

1466
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:30,879
PC Matic Lee is

1467
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:34,463
Good song for him to be with police in them

1468
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:36,511
He only

1469
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:42,911
He's growing old his subconscious is coming out

1470
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:44,447
You singing along

1471
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:46,495
It's almost

1472
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:48,799
Diegetic songs

1473
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:50,335
His life

1474
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:51,103
Viewmatic

1475
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:53,663
Crazy man

1476
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:55,199
I think he does

1477
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:56,479
And I think he's hoping

1478
01:13:57,247 --> 01:13:58,527
It doesn't go bad

1479
01:13:58,783 --> 01:13:59,551
We can still do that

1480
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:04,671
Cut it overhead

1481
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:09,791
Get rid of that studio studio get back down to your basics

1482
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:11,071
How many might have

1483
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:14,143
We could always use a little bit of that

1484
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:19,263
I told you earlier that I was

1485
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:20,799
Going to say something correct about Reagan

1486
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:22,591
Yes

1487
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:28,479
The state hospitals in the early age

1488
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:30,527
What

1489
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:31,295
I mean

1490
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:34,623
Whack jobs people

1491
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:40,255
You ruined it but you did get it

1492
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:43,583
Kind of got it

1493
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:45,887
Now what

1494
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:46,911
Is disgusting

1495
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:48,703
But this is a reference to

1496
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:53,055
New Mexico

1497
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:54,079
Whack job

1498
01:14:57,151 --> 01:14:58,431
Complete

1499
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:10,463
State Police

1500
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:32,735
Because they're signaling their people do whatever you want go crazy or going to let you out

1501
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:34,271
Just like that part 2

1502
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:41,183
He said the left wants to release all the criminals to do out of micro mods

1503
01:15:59,103 --> 01:16:01,919
The best fish oil

1504
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:02,687
Cool

1505
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:05,247
Yeah

1506
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:07,807
Krill oil

1507
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:11,391
Look dude

1508
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:14,719
Well done mediocre

1509
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:18,815
Realizing he's up against the brakes

1510
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:25,215
Timing is off

1511
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:26,239
I believe

1512
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:29,055
Parton Parton Parton

1513
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:35,455
Partime earlier the dinner with

1514
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:40,063
So what's left

1515
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:43,391
The death penalty goes away

1516
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:45,695
So whenever their operatives go out

1517
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:47,999
I'm at the revolution they can get them out of prison

1518
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:48,767
Which online

1519
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:50,303
Like that plans

1520
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:54,399
That's a long-term plan that's going to help

1521
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:55,935
If there's a revolution

1522
01:16:56,191 --> 01:17:00,543
Get it run out of prison

1523
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:03,103
The rules before stupid

1524
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:05,407
I don't know

1525
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:06,943
He's a guy who's only really

1526
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:11,551
Notable anyway because he was pretty early Oklahoma City bombing

1527
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:13,087
Skeptic

1528
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:14,623
Let's say

1529
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:18,463
Who claimed the same as you put out a report

1530
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:22,047
Exclaimed that the bomb

1531
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:23,071
They would have had

1532
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:24,095
Would have been

1533
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:24,863
Too small

1534
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:26,911
An unfortunate

1535
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:29,727
Other people have done reports that have been very

1536
01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:31,007
Physics

1537
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:36,639
Measuring the craters happened to write

1538
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:38,431
And they found it absolutely it

1539
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:43,295
Adjust a discredited Oklahoma City

1540
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:45,599
Dixie National General

1541
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:50,207
Yeah I just looking for his career but from what I understand

1542
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:51,999
The service

1543
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:55,583
Really take into consideration to just because someone's like

1544
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:58,911
A former FBI agent or an Air Force Colonel or general

1545
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:00,191
That doesn't mean they're also not

1546
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:04,543
A bunch of the people on Kerry Cassidy show

1547
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:07,103
Have actually been in the service

1548
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:09,919
A lot of a lying about it

1549
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:11,199
Actually have been

1550
01:18:11,455 --> 01:18:12,223
Preclude them from

1551
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:13,759
Also being

1552
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:15,039
Opportunistic

1553
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:19,135
I don't care

1554
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:20,927
I don't know

1555
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:23,487
Like when people talk it when people talk about

1556
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:25,535
Provoking

1557
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:27,839
Security clearance for the people

1558
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:30,399
Welcome I don't give a s***

1559
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:31,423
I think that's very

1560
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:34,495
And the reason is because

1561
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:35,519
Complicit

1562
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:38,847
It's a it's not about John Brennan losing his secure

1563
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:39,615
Clarence

1564
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:41,663
It's a message to other people who might

1565
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:42,431
Speak out against

1566
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:46,527
Any other way

1567
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:49,855
I'm going to get rid of other people

1568
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:50,623
It is

1569
01:18:50,879 --> 01:18:53,183
Threat from a desperate

1570
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:53,951
I will

1571
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:54,975
Cuz it's not just

1572
01:18:56,255 --> 01:19:01,119
Going to take clearance away from people who already are who are still in the job

1573
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:04,703
They can't do their job

1574
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:05,727
You know

1575
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:07,519
Weird

1576
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:09,055
Right

1577
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:10,591
That's one of those things

1578
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:11,615
That you don't know

1579
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:12,639
Until it happen

1580
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:14,431
I didn't know the president could just

1581
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:15,199
Do that

1582
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:16,223
I guess you can

1583
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:19,039
Like is that a thing he can do, why couldn't

1584
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:20,319
I don't know

1585
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:21,087
I don't know why he

1586
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:21,855
You could

1587
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:24,927
It seems like a randomized

1588
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:27,231
Did somebody just

1589
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:32,863
Whitney be able to just be like all right

1590
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:33,887
F*** you

1591
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:41,311
We had normal checks and balances

1592
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:48,991
Weird check we were planning on playing the weird

1593
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:50,783
That's why

1594
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:53,343
The Constitution people calling it like a

1595
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:56,927
No you don't you don't get it

1596
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:57,695
People are

1597
01:19:57,951 --> 01:20:04,095
F*****-up did they'll find a way to do some weird-ass ship but

1598
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:05,631
Even imagine that

1599
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:11,007
What president what person would founding fathers writing the Constitution

1600
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:12,031
Well

1601
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:14,336
Eventually we're going to have top-secret Clara

1602
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:18,176
We need a plan for that

1603
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:18,944
Constitution

1604
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,480
Until we got to

1605
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:22,784
We tried the village we tried the articles

1606
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:23,552
The confederation

1607
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:24,576
That had

1608
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:26,368
0 security clearance

1609
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:31,744
No Provisions that the president of the United States

1610
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,328
Probably like America

1611
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:39,936
You know what's really fun about it

1612
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:44,032
Yeah I think that we do have a problem and that we probably do need to

1613
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:45,056
In some ways

1614
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:45,824
Is the Constitution

1615
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:48,128
Now

1616
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:50,176
But the problem

1617
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:54,016
Again..

1618
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:57,088
The idea of being able to change it

1619
01:20:57,344 --> 01:20:58,624
Never having another amend

1620
01:20:59,136 --> 01:20:59,648
Is crazy

1621
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:00,928
Yeah it did

1622
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:04,256
Constitution is set in stone by virtue of the fact that we can agree on

1623
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:08,864
Absolutely

1624
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:10,656
I would agree on that

1625
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:15,264
Because people need

1626
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,312
Who did need to be jostled into the reality

1627
01:21:17,824 --> 01:21:18,592
Like this system

1628
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:20,384
Is stupid and untenable

1629
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:21,920
But anyway

1630
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:22,944
This next clip

1631
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:24,224
I got to say

1632
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:25,504
Blue my mind

1633
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:26,784
Because

1634
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:27,808
This

1635
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:30,112
Infowars made

1636
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:33,440
This together as a bumper

1637
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:34,976
To come in from Commercial Way

1638
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:37,536
And I don't know what the f*** they were thinking

1639
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:49,984
Not your mother's talk radio

1640
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:54,336
Alex

1641
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:55,360
As v-neck

1642
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:57,408
Little bumper coming in

1643
01:22:57,664 --> 01:22:58,176
Kicks in

1644
01:22:58,432 --> 01:23:04,320
That is nuts realize how

1645
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:06,624
Very close that is to the

1646
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:13,024
Drop we have for the rep

1647
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:23,008
Makes me think you might want to try that

1648
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:30,688
The other the other

1649
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:34,272
Play sing-along

1650
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:35,808
But it's so close

1651
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:38,112
You make me think of do me and like

1652
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:50,656
I'd like that more than anything he's done in the past two years I'll tell you that right now whoever is behind the scenes

1653
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:53,472
Not together or something like that

1654
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:54,496
The impulse

1655
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:55,264
Estranged

1656
01:23:56,032 --> 01:24:00,128
Especially since that ends with like there will be fire you're going to hell

1657
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:06,272
Really long interview with sibel Edmonds

1658
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:07,808
Episode metal care to talk about it

1659
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:10,624
Are the people who will still go on his

1660
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,416
The show I don't think that a lot of

1661
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:15,232
She she was a 911 whistleblower

1662
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:19,328
Her story is really complicated

1663
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:23,424
Highway from it a little bit is that a lot of

1664
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:24,704
She is a legend

1665
01:24:25,216 --> 01:24:26,240
I'm already in

1666
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:27,008
Report

1667
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:28,288
Should have not been made public

1668
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:29,824
So they're like a lot of things

1669
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:31,104
She's asserting about

1670
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:36,992
Confidential document unreleased by size

1671
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:39,552
I'm an end so I just don't care

1672
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:40,832
How to get into it because I

1673
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:41,856
Really

1674
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:43,648
Figure out the veracity of a lot

1675
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:47,744
But to talk about

1676
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:49,280
Antibiotics

1677
01:24:49,536 --> 01:24:50,816
Erdewan

1678
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:53,888
How do you say flood

1679
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:55,680
Muslims into Europe

1680
01:24:56,192 --> 01:24:59,520
Stuff like that

1681
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:01,056
Hey Michael Flynn

1682
01:25:02,336 --> 01:25:04,640
Just wanted to

1683
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:06,944
And the other thing is

1684
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:07,968
Is it that I don't believe in

1685
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:10,784
Scenario any world

1686
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:12,576
Trump didn't know about that

1687
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:13,344
Or there was

1688
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:14,112
I'm some sort of like

1689
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:15,648
Tacit approval

1690
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:18,976
When we're at with our two wanted

1691
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:20,512
Extradite

1692
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:22,560
Still like the idea that they are now

1693
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:23,584
Like Alex is now

1694
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:25,632
Talking all this s*** about turkey

1695
01:25:26,656 --> 01:25:27,424
I get why

1696
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:31,520
But you have to reconcile that with the fact that according to your worldview

1697
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:33,312
When was secretly

1698
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:35,360
You fighting this war against

1699
01:25:35,616 --> 01:25:41,760
The globalists in the islamists and one of the things he was doing was working for the other one

1700
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:44,064
For now presenting is a horrible dictator

1701
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:45,344
Flood

1702
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:46,368
Europe with Muslim

1703
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:52,000
Because it's in response to Trump being like you should probably

1704
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:55,072
To go cuz he really didn't orchestrate that coup

1705
01:25:55,328 --> 01:25:56,352
Which lesbianas

1706
01:25:56,608 --> 01:25:57,120
Erdewan

1707
01:25:57,376 --> 01:25:57,888
You know

1708
01:25:58,144 --> 01:25:59,936
I know we didn't happen

1709
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:09,408
When working for Venezuela now to bill

1710
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:11,712
If you're white you're working for Brazil's f******

1711
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:15,808
Ludacris government drive too far down

1712
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:16,576
That well cuz

1713
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:17,344
It's irrelevant.

1714
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:18,368
Dolphin Reef

1715
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:19,392
Up here all night

1716
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:21,440
Suffice

1717
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:23,744
And I don't care cover that interview because

1718
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:30,656
It would take too long to try and parse out like why where's your where's your lying

1719
01:26:33,472 --> 01:26:34,752
He's mostly just talk about it

1720
01:26:35,008 --> 01:26:35,776
Because it's another way to

1721
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:40,640
Some of the Roundup of stories

1722
01:26:41,152 --> 01:26:42,432
One of them

1723
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:43,968
Is about to have someone

1724
01:26:44,224 --> 01:26:46,528
Out there is standing up for Infowars

1725
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:48,064
That's important news

1726
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:53,440
Tucker Carlson graduated

1727
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:54,464
Yep

1728
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:56,512
AR-15 are back one viral

1729
01:26:57,024 --> 01:27:03,168
Girl challenges all Apple Store devices to show infowars.com protest

1730
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:03,936
Censorship

1731
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:04,960
Video

1732
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:12,128
Alex Jones Infowars from their it

1733
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:24,928
Infowars.com

1734
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:41,056
Everybody that stuff like that it will totally blow up in their face big time

1735
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:41,824
No

1736
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:46,432
She's doing now because like

1737
01:27:46,944 --> 01:27:47,968
In the last couple days

1738
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:53,344
She posted on Twitter her outside of that school the promise school that LeBron James

1739
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:54,624
Has come out and said

1740
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:55,648
He's going to

1741
01:27:58,208 --> 01:28:03,328
Going to pay for college

1742
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:05,120
Yeah stop for the parents

1743
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:05,888
Some stuff like that

1744
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:07,680
It's so she went to the school

1745
01:28:08,192 --> 01:28:11,776
She posted a picture of herself outside with the microphone

1746
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:13,568
About how she's going to get to the bottom

1747
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,104
Who's paying for the school

1748
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,896
Hint it's not LeBron James

1749
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:20,224
Which everyone started dunking on her because

1750
01:28:20,736 --> 01:28:24,064
It's a public school

1751
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:26,368
No no he's not paying for the school

1752
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:29,952
No for the kids at the school

1753
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:32,256
And if they graduate paying for them

1754
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:44,032
Bread

1755
01:28:44,544 --> 01:28:47,360
Which is even more admirable because it is going

1756
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:48,640
To be funded and run

1757
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:53,504
It's almost like a

1758
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:56,832
It's a it's a public-private partnership that is

1759
01:28:57,344 --> 01:29:01,184
Very fascinating and it'll be really excited to see how it works out

1760
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:03,232
Because

1761
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:04,000
She's trying to

1762
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:05,024
Is so

1763
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:05,792
Stupid

1764
01:29:06,048 --> 01:29:06,816
Like it's like

1765
01:29:07,328 --> 01:29:07,840
You could just

1766
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:10,912
Look at the definition of look at what the school is

1767
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:12,448
Look at what LeBron James

1768
01:29:12,704 --> 01:29:15,008
Is claiming he's doing what his plan is

1769
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:16,544
You couldn't find fault

1770
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:17,568
With that unless

1771
01:29:17,824 --> 01:29:19,616
All you want to do is trying

1772
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:26,016
Teardown of black man who's criticized daddy president

1773
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:27,552
She's been about except for

1774
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:30,368
Walking around and trying to get Instagram famous with guns

1775
01:29:30,624 --> 01:29:32,928
For her entire us short

1776
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:35,232
Impressive career

1777
01:29:35,488 --> 01:29:36,256
And now she's

1778
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:38,048
He's doing the Infowars which

1779
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:39,328
It's not surprising at all

1780
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:41,376
Congratulations Kaitlin Bennett

1781
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:42,912
You are a disaster

1782
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:43,936
And this is another thing

1783
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:45,984
She's so young

1784
01:29:47,008 --> 01:29:48,032
This is something that I

1785
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:50,336
Hope that she'll feel bad about later

1786
01:29:50,848 --> 01:29:51,360
Miss White

1787
01:29:51,872 --> 01:29:53,408
Really is hard for me to make fun of her

1788
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:55,712
Continue through make a lot of mistake

1789
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:57,248
And these are big

1790
01:29:58,016 --> 01:29:58,528
Peter big

1791
01:29:58,784 --> 01:29:59,808
Very public mistake

1792
01:30:00,576 --> 01:30:02,112
And I pray that you learned your lesson

1793
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:04,672
Not learned her lesson like

1794
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:08,256
She learns her lesson is able to

1795
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:10,048
Live a healthy full life

1796
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:10,816
After this

1797
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:11,840
Because this

1798
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:13,376
Don't go good places

1799
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:16,960
Jim have a career after this other than being like

1800
01:30:17,472 --> 01:30:19,520
Maybe she gets to be another Tommy Lauren

1801
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:20,800
And then just give

1802
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:21,568
Dunked on

1803
01:30:21,824 --> 01:30:22,336
Constantly

1804
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:24,128
Is a shill engine

1805
01:30:24,384 --> 01:30:24,896
Is the pretty face

1806
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:26,176
Propaganda

1807
01:30:26,944 --> 01:30:27,456
It's not

1808
01:30:29,248 --> 01:30:29,760
It's a sad

1809
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:31,808
A lady

1810
01:30:32,832 --> 01:30:33,344
Weeded

1811
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:34,624
Dumb

1812
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:36,672
Racist joke

1813
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:39,232
And God

1814
01:30:39,488 --> 01:30:40,256
Plane

1815
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:42,048
And then when she landed

1816
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:43,840
She was not allowed to be

1817
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:44,608
Be part of cyst

1818
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:46,144
Society anymore

1819
01:30:46,656 --> 01:30:47,168
And

1820
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:48,704
These people are allowed

1821
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:51,264
Best banana

1822
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:53,824
It's weird I don't know why

1823
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:55,104
Actually going to give you

1824
01:30:57,408 --> 01:30:58,176
Bananas

1825
01:30:58,688 --> 01:31:00,224
What do you mean

1826
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:07,136
0 most done here

1827
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:08,416
And I know you're tired

1828
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:09,952
I want to unwrap

1829
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:11,232
Be up all night

1830
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:12,768
But

1831
01:31:13,024 --> 01:31:13,536
Before we go

1832
01:31:15,072 --> 01:31:16,608
Alex thinks that everyone's taking him out of

1833
01:31:18,912 --> 01:31:20,192
And I actually kind of agree

1834
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:21,216
To a certain extent

1835
01:31:21,728 --> 01:31:27,360
I believe that I watched the entire clip of him talking about have your battle rifles ready

1836
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:30,176
And I know it's violent language

1837
01:31:30,432 --> 01:31:31,968
Prepare people for the idea that violence

1838
01:31:32,224 --> 01:31:32,992
Was probably necessary

1839
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:35,808
Advocating going out in shooting

1840
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:38,880
And people who are construing

1841
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:40,672
I think it's a little bit

1842
01:31:40,928 --> 01:31:41,696
Unfair to him

1843
01:31:41,952 --> 01:31:45,024
He brought it on himself in this is exactly the reaction

1844
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:48,864
But the news is covering in saying that he has viola

1845
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:50,656
Stuff like that

1846
01:31:50,912 --> 01:31:51,936
I do think you could

1847
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:52,960
Construe it that way

1848
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:54,496
I think that is one interpretation

1849
01:31:55,008 --> 01:31:57,568
That is fair but Alex

1850
01:31:57,824 --> 01:31:59,360
Construe it that way that's not what I

1851
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:00,896
Google so

1852
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:02,176
To say

1853
01:32:02,432 --> 01:32:02,944
Sew in

1854
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:05,248
In response to that

1855
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:07,808
The media all they do is take one or two words

1856
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:08,832
And Karma

1857
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:10,368
And make me save Mad Lib

1858
01:32:11,904 --> 01:32:13,696
Which is a sort of complaint

1859
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:15,232
Whenever people are actually talk

1860
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:16,512
Wichita

1861
01:32:22,656 --> 01:32:24,192
Revealed

1862
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:25,216
Descriptive

1863
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:30,080
Deceptive

1864
01:32:30,592 --> 01:32:33,152
It's not a pedophile Lisa 90

1865
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:36,992
Children and molestation cases

1866
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:42,880
He just read quotes

1867
01:32:46,464 --> 01:32:49,280
He didn't say that

1868
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:54,400
I got chills up my spine

1869
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:55,680
Chemical Guys

1870
01:32:55,936 --> 01:32:56,704
Never said any of that

1871
01:33:03,104 --> 01:33:05,664
And their stories

1872
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:07,456
Fill in the blank

1873
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:11,808
They don't even have the words to put it together

1874
01:33:17,184 --> 01:33:17,696
Show

1875
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:20,512
This isn't even

1876
01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:23,584
Here's an example

1877
01:33:36,384 --> 01:33:40,736
We combine those words

1878
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:45,856
Let's use the same technique and see what Lester Holt

1879
01:33:57,888 --> 01:34:04,032
Criminal charges

1880
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:28,608
I'm all ears

1881
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:30,656
That's f***** up

1882
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:33,984
I mean there's no other way to slice that

1883
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:35,776
That's really f***** up

1884
01:34:36,544 --> 01:34:39,104
I get what he's trying to do and I get the

1885
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,640
Point he's trying to make

1886
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:43,712
Stupid ways to do that than that

1887
01:34:43,968 --> 01:34:45,248
I don't think it is audience

1888
01:34:45,504 --> 01:34:47,552
Understands necessarily the points

1889
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:49,600
What he's doing in might listen to that I'd be like

1890
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:51,904
Pedophile

1891
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:53,440
I bet

1892
01:34:56,256 --> 01:34:58,304
I just heard that

1893
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:00,608
I know he probably thinks

1894
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:01,632
Itsfunneh

1895
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:02,912
It's not

1896
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:03,936
He probably thinks it's

1897
01:35:04,192 --> 01:35:04,704
Clever

1898
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:05,472
It's not

1899
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:08,544
And like we could do a much better version of that

1900
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:09,312
With Alex

1901
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:10,848
If we wanted to

1902
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:16,992
I mean pecan already stealing our bed

1903
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:20,576
He's been stealing our bit but doing it's so terrible

1904
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:22,624
I don't really care

1905
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:26,976
I think that a lot of this boils down to I don't really care

1906
01:35:27,232 --> 01:35:27,744
I'm really fast

1907
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,024
Needed by the reversion

1908
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:29,792
De Pasto

1909
01:35:32,864 --> 01:35:34,144
I think I would like that to continue

1910
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:36,192
I would too

1911
01:35:36,448 --> 01:35:37,472
Much more in

1912
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:39,008
Interesting

1913
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:42,336
And not liking

1914
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:46,432
Vikings the show better man

1915
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:47,968
This more human

1916
01:35:48,224 --> 01:35:49,760
To a repetition of

1917
01:35:50,272 --> 01:35:50,784
Anger and bigoted

1918
01:35:53,344 --> 01:35:55,648
I kept listen specifically because

1919
01:35:57,952 --> 01:35:58,464
Justice

1920
01:35:58,720 --> 01:35:59,232
Genius

1921
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:00,512
Absolutely

1922
01:36:00,768 --> 01:36:01,280
Okay

1923
01:36:01,536 --> 01:36:05,120
Donald Trump criticizes

1924
01:36:05,376 --> 01:36:07,168
Criticizing no wires and telling truth

1925
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:10,496
You're the ones calling you do it the same

1926
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:11,520
Program

1927
01:36:22,016 --> 01:36:28,160
Prepared still obvious

1928
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:34,560
What year

1929
01:36:34,816 --> 01:36:35,840
Infowars.com

1930
01:36:36,608 --> 01:36:39,168
So what he's done is create a preemptive Justice

1931
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:41,728
Application for something that you probably think

1932
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:47,872
Is a very good high likelihood sort of thing which is attacking journalist someone.

1933
01:36:48,896 --> 01:36:49,920
Or something like that

1934
01:36:50,176 --> 01:36:52,224
He's now created The Narrative ahead of time

1935
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:55,040
That all you guys are going to false-flag yourselves

1936
01:36:55,296 --> 01:36:57,600
So you look like the victims ahead of the midterm

1937
01:36:58,112 --> 01:36:59,648
Thereby clearing the conscious

1938
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:01,952
Any of his wonderful great

1939
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:03,488
Americana listeners

1940
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:04,768
And militiamen

1941
01:37:06,304 --> 01:37:09,632
Murder somebody and they go

1942
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:14,752
It has nothing to do with our rhetoric

1943
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:17,312
Galati's guns and then letting them

1944
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:18,336
It's not that

1945
01:37:18,848 --> 01:37:22,432
We can continue doing everything we want to do

1946
01:37:24,992 --> 01:37:25,504
Further its

1947
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:32,928
The reason I say it's brilliant is because on some level I think Alex has to know that

1948
01:37:33,184 --> 01:37:39,328
You know if I were a betting man I would say someone's going to attack us

1949
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:41,888
Has any kind of

1950
01:37:42,144 --> 01:37:43,424
Cover for yourself

1951
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:48,288
You better have that narrative in place that like this fake they're doing it to themselves cuz they're all

1952
01:37:48,544 --> 01:37:52,384
Spaces for their way

1953
01:37:52,896 --> 01:37:55,456
And I know they just need pity

1954
01:37:55,712 --> 01:37:56,992
From people or else they're not good

1955
01:37:57,504 --> 01:37:58,784
Going to work and so

1956
01:37:59,040 --> 01:37:59,552
Themselves

1957
01:38:00,064 --> 01:38:00,832
And we're cool

1958
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:02,368
I think that sucks

1959
01:38:02,624 --> 01:38:03,392
I think it's very lame

1960
01:38:03,904 --> 01:38:04,928
It's very smart

1961
01:38:05,184 --> 01:38:05,952
Your someone like Alex

1962
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:06,720
Because

1963
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:09,024
That might help you not get sick

1964
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:14,144
So we've come to the end of this now

1965
01:38:16,448 --> 01:38:16,960
No

1966
01:38:17,728 --> 01:38:18,752
I still hate him in the present

1967
01:38:19,264 --> 01:38:22,080
But it's much more interesting when we are diamond gusset commercials

1968
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:23,872
It's always better when we have.

1969
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:28,224
Alex sing-along to Pancho and Lefty like he has so many years ago in the past

1970
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:32,320
And then this weird wrinkle of him not being able to prepare for break

1971
01:38:33,088 --> 01:38:34,624
I think there's something going on

1972
01:38:35,392 --> 01:38:36,416
I'm not sure what it is

1973
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:38,208
I don't care that much

1974
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:41,792
In terms of mysteries I want to solve

1975
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:42,560
That's not high on the way

1976
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:44,608
I don't know why

1977
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:45,888
We would talk to me

1978
01:38:47,424 --> 01:38:47,936
I don't

1979
01:38:48,704 --> 01:38:50,752
I don't because because

1980
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:54,848
No no I mean like any kind of truck

1981
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:57,920
There's nothing to say because what they are doing

1982
01:38:58,432 --> 01:38:58,944
Is

1983
01:38:59,712 --> 01:39:01,504
Implicitly recognizes

1984
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:03,552
That what they're doing is wrong

1985
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:05,856
And the way they justify what they're doing

1986
01:39:06,368 --> 01:39:07,648
Is by claiming that

1987
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:08,928
The left is doing it

1988
01:39:09,184 --> 01:39:10,464
Or the other side is more wrong

1989
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:16,864
Doesn't matter it does not matter what it is you say to them

1990
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:18,400
Nope because all of that is

1991
01:39:18,656 --> 01:39:20,192
Is part of their paranoid fantasies

1992
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:21,472
It gives them

1993
01:39:21,984 --> 01:39:26,592
To commit the evils that they are accusing you of committing

1994
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:27,616
To continue funk

1995
01:39:27,872 --> 01:39:29,152
Like we are we are

1996
01:39:29,408 --> 01:39:30,176
Constantly talking

1997
01:39:30,432 --> 01:39:30,944
Can two people

1998
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:33,248
Who are infected with this brainvire

1999
01:39:34,016 --> 01:39:34,528
And cannot

2000
01:39:34,784 --> 01:39:36,064
Ever break free

2001
01:39:36,576 --> 01:39:39,136
Unless there's something so there's some sort of

2002
01:39:39,392 --> 01:39:40,672
AAA

2003
01:39:42,464 --> 01:39:46,048
Lego Civil War breaks them out of this inertia

2004
01:39:46,304 --> 01:39:48,864
Because it's not going to happen

2005
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:49,632
Talkington

2006
01:39:49,888 --> 01:39:52,704
You're right you think that and generally speaking that might be

2007
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:55,264
But there are people who have

2008
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:56,032
Forgotten

2009
01:39:56,288 --> 01:40:00,384
You know there are means that it's possible

2010
01:40:00,896 --> 01:40:02,432
So I don't think you need that occurred

2011
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:04,736
Stream of a situation maybe you needs

2012
01:40:04,992 --> 01:40:05,504
Something

2013
01:40:06,016 --> 01:40:07,552
Stream

2014
01:40:07,808 --> 01:40:09,088
Like someone has to have a moment of

2015
01:40:09,344 --> 01:40:13,952
Crisis

2016
01:40:14,464 --> 01:40:14,976
Poop

2017
01:40:15,232 --> 01:40:16,512
What what is

2018
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:18,560
What is behind the rhetoric

2019
01:40:19,328 --> 01:40:22,912
That might be extreme in an individual's life require a civil war

2020
01:40:25,472 --> 01:40:26,240
I mean it's

2021
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:30,080
The way that they will take it

2022
01:40:30,592 --> 01:40:31,616
But if their needs

2023
01:40:31,872 --> 01:40:32,896
To be a national

2024
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:34,176
Some sort of crisis

2025
01:40:34,688 --> 01:40:36,736
That jostles these people out of it

2026
01:40:37,248 --> 01:40:41,088
Sure and I don't mean the Civil War

2027
01:40:41,344 --> 01:40:44,160
To be some sort of

2028
01:40:44,416 --> 01:40:48,512
No matter what the outcome of the midterms are I think

2029
01:40:49,024 --> 01:40:50,304
Next year year-and-a-half or so

2030
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:51,072
Will start

2031
01:40:51,328 --> 01:40:52,096
Still out of the

2032
01:40:53,632 --> 01:40:54,400
Coming home to roost

2033
01:40:56,192 --> 01:40:56,704
Action

2034
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:59,776
There's more time you'll see more of the

2035
01:41:00,544 --> 01:41:02,848
The trade War stop not really work out in our favor

2036
01:41:03,104 --> 01:41:03,616
You'll see

2037
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:06,944
You'll see people being

2038
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:08,480
Banned from the country

2039
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:09,504
As we're already

2040
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:10,528
You'll see all these

2041
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:12,320
Trends that are already

2042
01:41:14,112 --> 01:41:14,624
Germinating

2043
01:41:15,136 --> 01:41:15,904
You'll see the plant

2044
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:16,928
Start to grow

2045
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:20,000
Test case of

2046
01:41:20,256 --> 01:41:22,560
And this is something that's been reported on

2047
01:41:22,816 --> 01:41:24,608
For years now but

2048
01:41:24,864 --> 01:41:27,424
The people on whatever island it is

2049
01:41:27,936 --> 01:41:29,216
The island is sinking

2050
01:41:29,472 --> 01:41:31,008
Specifically because of climate

2051
01:41:31,776 --> 01:41:33,056
And they all voted for

2052
01:41:33,824 --> 01:41:35,616
And none of them believe in climate

2053
01:41:36,128 --> 01:41:42,272
Like it doesn't matter what's going on they're even there's their lives and they're just still

2054
01:41:42,784 --> 01:41:44,320
Trump is great

2055
01:41:44,576 --> 01:41:50,464
You can apply that to everybody

2056
01:41:51,232 --> 01:41:52,000
Yeah yeah

2057
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:53,536
I know

2058
01:41:54,304 --> 01:41:55,584
Be a little more optimistic

2059
01:41:56,608 --> 01:41:57,376
I don't know I don't know

2060
01:41:57,632 --> 01:41:58,400
We can't predict the future

2061
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:03,264
All we can do is inoculate people from this weekend's virus

2062
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:06,080
All is calm

2063
01:42:06,592 --> 01:42:10,432
You can follow us on Twitter and I was on Facebook

2064
01:42:10,688 --> 01:42:16,576
I have a group called domicile your mother your brilliant you can go to iTunes and ignore Alex

2065
01:42:16,832 --> 01:42:19,904
Podcast

2066
01:42:23,232 --> 01:42:24,000
Is it my turn

2067
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:26,304
I don't know there's

2068
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:27,072
So many people

2069
01:42:28,096 --> 01:42:31,168
Like what's that horrible woman's name Caitlin Barnett

2070
01:42:32,448 --> 01:42:32,960
She can go f***

2071
01:42:33,216 --> 01:42:34,240
Agree with that
