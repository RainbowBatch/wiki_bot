00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:21,248
Jordan

2
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I have great respect for knowledge by now I'm sick of them posing as you're through the good guy

3
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:34,048
We are the bad guys

4
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
MoneyGram

5
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:59,136
Stripe.com

6
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Acknowledge

7
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:11,936
Friday Friday

8
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:18,336
The day of the day of Rodger Stones pardoning I imagine well no no no not yet

9
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:24,992
Just just an hour or so before we started recording project done with vents to 40 months in prison

10
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:28,576
And your prediction is by the time is open

11
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,136
He will be pardoned

12
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:37,792
My prediction although I am not like I'm not super into making actual prediction so we can make this a Gamble

13
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,072
I predict

14
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:43,936
That it will be apart in the Qualcomm whatever Trump wants to disrupt the next new cycle

15
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:44,704
That either needs

16
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,776
Till I get bad news away from him

17
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:52,640
Possible Democratic primary something I have to do the Democratic primary

18
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:59,040
Throw a Rodger Stone pardon in screw up a new cycle

19
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:05,440
Zico we just Unearthed reports the Trump is killed six people by hand and then he's like I'm pardon Rodger Stone and they're like

20
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:11,840
Well we got to ignore that news it's like if you were going to do it anyway it doesn't really matter when you're going to do it

21
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:15,168
So why not use it to some affect the same argument is like

22
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,312
You're going to do it doesn't matter when you do it might as well do it now as we're in the middle of recording

23
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:27,712
Rich's him just justice so why not

24
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:34,112
Speaking as a couple of dudes who live in Chicago Illinois

25
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:43,328
People who love Rod Blagojevich Chicago

26
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,704
I think he has a about the same amount of public love is ROM

27
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,032
We're not we're not very kind to our government officials

28
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:57,664
Because they're not kind to us it seems like there's some of that

29
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:02,016
Shut off a little tangent there

30
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:04,320
Have you ever wanted something classic

31
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:09,184
Let me give you an example you know like some people have always wanted

32
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:16,608
Desired something like that I like old radios

33
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:20,960
Metal bracket radios in 1930

34
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,520
Rehab radio on my mantle

35
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:28,640
I was considering a collection of a collection of radios together

36
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,920
But some of the

37
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:36,320
Really f****** expensive and that is not in the car

38
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:42,976
Recommend some of them two are like really huge and I don't know how much I could commit to that kind of a Decor thing

39
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:46,816
Like-like bar cabinet size and order it is

40
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:53,216
Ferrari I like that but other than that I don't know I'm not super into antiques

41
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,520
Player guy or anything like that

42
00:03:55,776 --> 00:04:01,920
Old style guitar not real not real keytar guy

43
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:06,528
No but actually the other thing Decor wise that I I would like

44
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,832
Is a bunch of like

45
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,600
Either

46
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,904
Communist or anti-communist

47
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:18,303
Propaganda posters actual ones that are just like new re-imaginings of what

48
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,607
Aesthetic

49
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,911
And onward in the Cold War era was

50
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:29,055
I would be really into that like an antique posters but also I think those are probably f****** rude

51
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,615
Super expensive

52
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:36,223
No. They don't they don't care too much for Originals of things

53
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:42,623
Yeah I've just been watching the show on Netflix called

54
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:49,023
British show where the Great British repair Show

55
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,071
Really really talented restores

56
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:54,655
At this little shop and they're all happy all the time

57
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:58,751
Fixing people's heirlooms and smiling and enjoying themselves and I can't help

58
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,823
But want to go on that show with something old and I don't got

59
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:07,199
It's unfortunate that you need something old in order to gain access to this thing that makes the

60
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:13,599
Google positive feeling that's rude of them

61
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,415
I've not seen that show Jordan I do know a lot about Alex Jones

62
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,975
We can do this podcast

63
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,279
I'm so Jordan today I have something

64
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,327
That is I guess

65
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:28,191
Related to Jermaine Dupri

66
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,215
Jermaine Dupri

67
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:32,543
I'm going to go Jackson but we're alright

68
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,591
Yeah this is

69
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:40,991
This I would have got prepared today is I would look at it as kind of like a saying farewell to Rodger if he's going

70
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:45,087
For a while we won't be able to enjoy some good

71
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:49,951
Like high-register really in his element Rogers soundtrack

72
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:53,279
I found something that I think we can all enjoy

73
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:59,679
And no matter what even if you feel bad about the fact that Rodger is probably not going to prison he's probably going to get a pardon

74
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,215
Even if you feel like everything is

75
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:01,983
Shity

76
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,031
You can still enjoy some of

77
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:07,615
So I will get down to business on that in a second but before we do

78
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:11,199
Got to give a little shout-out to the book who signed up and recording the show

79
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,223

89
00:06:54,719 --> 00:07:00,863
Elevated levels

Jama adelaida technocrat

91
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:15,455
What's the business

92
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,991
Why you pimp so good

93
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:20,063
Is freakishly large

TVM Adelaide

95
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:32,863
Hey I'd rather show I'd like to support these dents website

96
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,655
So you can press it goes to my patreon

97
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,935
Sports shop

98
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:41,055
I don't know if you know this but don't I know but

99
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:44,639
Back in February 2019 Jerome corsi

100
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:49,503
Filed a lawsuit against Rodger Stone

101
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:56,415
This was the ultimate result of the two men's collaboration during the 2016 campaign where course he and Rodger working together

102
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,207
Go to try to get in touch with Julian Assange

103
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:04,095
Now we've heard Alex Jones say on her multiple times that he explicitly told Rodger to get in touch with us on

104
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:08,703
And both corsi and Rodger were working at Infowars at the time or working with them at very least

105
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:13,567
But it might be too much of a stretch to say that the two men's actions were being done specifically

106
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,359
At the order of Alex

107
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,383
Fair

108
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:22,783
Whatever the case when you work with Rodger Stone things tend to not go great for you

109
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:27,391
It's super rare for people to walk away without some kind of Darkness looming over their lives

110
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,183
If they're lucky to not get arrested

111
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:36,351
At the center of the falling out that the two of them had was the tweet that Rodger posted on August 21st

112
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,887
2016 it said quote

113
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,215
Trust me it will soon be podesta's time in the barrel

114
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,751
#crooked Hillary

115
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,895
Predated the release of the Hacked podesta emails and based on all available information

116
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:54,015
I appreciated anyone outside of WikiLeaks new knowing that they were going to be released

117
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,551
According to Coursey

118
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,855
A couple days after Rodger posted that tweet

119
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:04,255
Rodger asked corsi to draft a memo that he could use as a cover story for why he tweeted something he should have no business

120
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,047
It's snowing about right

121
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,863
This member was allegedly about how Rodger wrote that

122
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,423
Based on research the course he'd been doing on

123
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:15,007
Quote podesta and Hillary is alleged relationship

124
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,799
With Russian companies

125
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,591
Drum I ratfuck myself

126
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:21,919
I need direct Buck you to get my ratfuck out of myself

127
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:26,015
After my mother's started investigating and it became clear that this just wasn't

128
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:31,647
True course he came out at by late 2018 and admitted that the memo he'd written with Ally

129
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:35,231
And was made specifically to explain why Rodger posted that tweet

130
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:39,327
A course he came out and made some comments that were not looking good for

131
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,631
Rodger who was about to be indicted by Mueller

132
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:45,727
I have the story you told me interviews with investigators is coming a bit unraveled

133
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:48,543
Rodger went on the attack against Jerome corsi

134
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:52,127
He started talking s*** about him on Infowars which if your courses

135
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,407
Kind of should have expected

136
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:59,551
Every course he work for Alex he knows that there's no rules about responsibilities that are practiced in Florida

137
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,319
Ridiculous

138
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:05,183
If you get stabbed in the back by Rodger that's your fault you should never have turned your back garage out

139
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:09,791
Associate with him metal plate on your back at all

140
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:15,935
So Rodger railed on Coursey on-air then social media Legend of course he was working with Mueller to jam up

141
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:22,079
Course he claimed these attacks had resulted in him suffering quote intentional infliction of emotional distress and assault

142
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:27,455
An article article in Newsweek says that course he claimed Rodger quote

143
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,759
Carried out a campaign of threats against him

144
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:32,063
To cause him to have heart attacks and strokes

145
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:36,671
In order that plaintiff will be unable to testify it's don't criminal trial

146
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,463
Good.

147
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:44,863
He claimed that Rodger was doing this sort of intimidation because he fancied himself a little bit of a gangster type many love them

148
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:51,775
This argument games a little credibility based on the fact that one of the Rogers charges in the Mueller case was related to

149
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:54,591
Witness intimidation directed towards Randy credico

150
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,407
The other person Rodger tried to use as a scapegoat

151
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,687
Explain his Advanced knowledge

152
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,967
Of the podesta emails

153
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,991
His friend

154
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:08,927
Friend said he tried to stitch up you know how you talk to your friend I'm going to take your dog away from you

155
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:15,327
Hi c********* I will still say though even though there's some credible

156
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,887
Ability because of Rogers Behavior towards critical

157
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:21,471
I think the idea that he was trying to give course your heart attack might be a little much

158
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:24,543
A little dramatic

159
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,871
Plot of course he's suit is that

160
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:30,687
Based on his being named as a material Witness

161
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:33,503
And considering things that you knew about Rodger

162
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,039
He believed that Rogers actor

163
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:39,135
Attempt to intimidate him out of cooperating with the case against Rodger

164
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:44,767
In the process Rodger was defaming course in order to smear him to make his testimony seem less credible

165
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:48,863
Or even make it appear the course he was the criminal behind this whole thing all along

166
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:55,007
The initial filing of the lawsuit list the defamatory statements and honestly it just sounds like Rodger being Rodger

167
00:11:55,263 --> 00:12:01,407
Now having said that

168
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:04,991
Ruby Rogers Rogers at the height of his life that's defamation

169
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:08,319
I'm not sure where the line is but none of it seems out of the ordinary

170
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:15,231
Course he's suing Rodger for 25 million dollars which I suspect was never going to go anywhere and honestly I

171
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:18,559
Hard time believing with this suit would even have gotten to a trial

172
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:25,215
The claim defamatory statements seem as best as I can tell it to be things that would be easy to claim our opinions but that's a matter for a job

173
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,239
You know I can't

174
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,775
I'm not going to make it legal

175
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:28,799
Decision

176
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:35,199
In his lawsuit course he decided to hire for his lawyer another person who's been slighted by Infowars

177
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,247
A man by the name of Larry klayman

178
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:44,159
You may remember him as the guy who wouldn't stop yelling about how Obama was trying to bring Ebola into the country to attack white people

179
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,975
And does the lawyer representing Dennis Montgomery

180
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,535
The guy who was working with Sheriff Joe Arpaio wants

181
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,631
Shady business that everyone decided to pretend was proof that Trump was being spied on

182
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,495
In terms of the places I've come across clam and I will say that he is not impress me much

183
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:05,151
I wouldn't hire him as my lawyer and it does not look great when you see people who are yeah that's that's scraping

184
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:11,551
Scraping the Barrel's bottom like for instance right now Larry klayman is representing George Zimmerman who is apparently suing

185
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,343
Elizabeth Warren and Pete buttigieg

186
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:18,719
Because they took it about how Trayvon Martin would be 25 years old right now if he wasn't dead

187
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:22,559
Wright-Patt lawsuit is seeking 265 million dollars

188
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,631
Is disgusting

189
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:30,495
It's not the most disgusting thing that Larry klayman has done

190
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,775
George Zimmerman

191
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:36,895
Because back in December they teamed up to sue Trayvon Martin's Family for 100 billion dollars

192
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:44,319
I can't imagine that lawsuit will work out but what it will definitely do is make people really warm up to the Zimmerman guy

193
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:50,719
Hey yeah you know I was thinking that he you know it's like it's like when you get piled on

194
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:54,047
You know it's so you've been publicly shamed by Jon Ronson

195
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,607
Similar to that but now my sympathies are gone

196
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,655
F******

197
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:05,055
The Southern Poverty Law Center has described claiming as quote pathologically litigious so I'm going to watch what

198
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,079
What I say about him

199
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,383
I know so that image of him being quote

200
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,711
Pathologically lifted just kind of comes into play in the corsi situation

201
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:15,551
Because as soon as corsi suit Rodger with claiming as his lawyer

202
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,855
Rodger started attacking both of them

203
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:20,415
Calling into question clayman's ability of the lawyer

204
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:26,815
And saying he had a little IQ Larry klayman turned around and sued Rodger along with course

205
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:33,215
Also sounds right

206
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:39,615
As well as somebody else on April 5th 2019 Coursey and claim and join their suit

207
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:44,223
It's against Rodger which was now also against Rogers associate Michael Caputo

208
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,527
With claiming still acting as a lawyer

209
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:53,183
Which brings us to why we're here today it's going to be like World War eventually all of these conservative personalities

210
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:59,583
Pick sides and then everybody's at like Kaitlin Bennett is suing Laura Loomer and that's all a fuckboy

211
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,863
Lawyer Larry klayman

212
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:06,495
Look totally

213
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,519
F******

214
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:10,335
Alright well then we know which side

215
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:15,455
In the past on our show Larry klayman has been associated with the organization Judicial Watch

216
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,735
Since he founded that grew

217
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,015
But he's actually left

218
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,831
You left back in around 2000

219
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,159
4 and ultimately started a new group called Freedom watch

220
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:27,999
In the evening hours of Tuesday February 18th 2020

221
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,279
Damn is it 2020

222
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:35,935
As I was editing up our Project Camelot episode that we released on Wednesday Freedom watch posted something that would have

223
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,215
Been an absolutely perfect

224
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,775
Wacky Wednesday episode and it's honestly

225
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:43,615
Like catnip to me so there's no way I could resist to an episode about this immediately

226
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:50,271
They posted a whole s*** ton of video of Rodger Stone being proposed for this lawsuit

227
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:56,671
Show me you were reading some of his deposition I thought you only had transcripts

228
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:59,999
I can't wait so as if that wasn't enough to get me excited

229
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,535
Like dude

230
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:07,935
He's being questioned by the opposing side's lawyer Larry klayman

231
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:17,151
God and this is going to be a base Larry klayman is the lawyer doing the deposition with two rods of God it's just

232
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,431
Almost perfect

233
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:22,015
That is very funny just a recipe for disaster

234
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:28,415
Took the deposition is 5 hours long on day one and then about 48 minutes as a rejoinder on a

235
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:31,743
The second base is 6 hours of s*** I had to go through

236
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:35,583
And you know what it doesn't disappoint if you're looking for a complete disaster

237
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:39,423
To give you a little since he was just a taste of some of the vibe

238
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:46,079
Did you call me a b**** that you're acting like one

239
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:52,479
12in the hippie like you're a dick and he's like oh you're a dick and then I'm not sure

240
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,271
Search there in a jeep Scout

241
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:58,111
It is frequently like that

242
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,391
Jesus

243
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:03,999
Great that'll give you a sense of the tone and the level of professionalism punches play here

244
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:10,655
I'm going to spare everyone from the pain of having to go through this seriously cuz it was mostly a jumbled mess of Rodger trolling liar

245
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:16,799
And I'm not sure I honestly learned that much about the case from watching all of that

246
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:17,567
First

247
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:21,151
Rodger is f****** loving being to post

248
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:26,527
God damn it I think he loves it particularly when it's flavored is the lawyer because I think

249
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,319
Duke from everything I can tell

250
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,367
He hates Larry

251
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:37,279
Busy now we're getting back from our evil ratfucker to low-key traversing the Earth sowing Discord

252
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,071
Very mad. I don't like it

253
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:44,959
Of all the different moods a person is capable of righteous indignation

254
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:51,103
Dear he's being asked questions about a case that he is not taking seriously which allows him to just be a complete dick

255
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:56,735
Because the target of it as someone who you also like a f*** yourself

256
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:03,391
It is a needs Loki I shouldn't if you can enjoy it a little bit

257
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,439
It sometimes despite myself

258
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:11,071
Get them Rodger just f****** do it kind of good at certain things

259
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:13,119
Competent

260
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,239
Bright

261
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:22,335
Second the other thing I need to tell you is I don't care what happens with this case

262
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:25,151
Is the very definition of a let him fight situation

263
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,271
Rodger probably definitely said some untrue things about both corsi inflaman

264
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,063
If he gets in trouble for it who cares

265
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:36,927
Also if he gets away with it course he's claiming both suck so I don't really care either

266
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:42,559
The only outcome of this no matter how it goes is that both sides end up wasting resources fighting with each other

267
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,607
Not alright in my book

268
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:51,263
So we've seen how Alex Jones Rob do in Paul Joseph Watson behave when they're forced to be under oath in a deposition

269
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:57,919
They change completely I'm either play dumb or pretend to be serious right now it's time to Xperia

270
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,455
Roger's phone number of

271
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:02,271
Which all seems very similar to Rodger Stone anywhere else

272
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,039
This dude

273
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,319
Does not give a f***

274
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:09,183
Begins by Bruno talking about some of Roger's history

275
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:13,791
And you know like his educational background and then working for the presidential campaign

276
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:19,423
You know what I never realized I guess probably should have known this earlier and I I bet I did I just didn't

277
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,703
Didn't remember

278
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,495
He didn't graduate from college

279
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:27,103
He didn't know you like which we year of college and then started working for Nixon

280
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:33,503
You can be whatever you want to be able to me that he doesn't have some sort of a degree or

281
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:39,903
Formal training in political science

282
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:46,303
He wouldn't do that and wouldn't do any formal training

283
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,863
To really tap into his right whakaaria

284
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:56,031
Yeah and so they talked about the early history and then the topic comes up of Wendy's to First

285
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:56,799
Grass Pad

286
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:57,823
Did the

287
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,383
Yes indeed

288
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,919
When was that you represented

289
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,735
Did I not meet you earlier

290
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,271
The Old Ebbitt Grill with

291
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,135
Time that

292
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:12,671
You met me

293
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,047
It's entirely possible

294
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:18,815
I just don't recall

295
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,375
And

296
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:22,911
True that

297
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:24,959
Let me put on the

298
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,079
I just don't recall

299
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:33,663
Rodger is not remember any of this ship

300
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:40,063
So as it turns out Larry klayman and Rodger Stone go way back and the two men have a rich history

301
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:46,719
Rodger believed that they met when claiming represented Rodger which will get back to but it appears that their paths crossed when clay

302
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:50,559
Women wanted to work on the Jack Kemp campaign in which Rodger wasn't advisor

303
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:57,215
That would have been the 1988 election so that puts being acquaintances of 32 units

304
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:01,823
I don't recall in time I don't recall you as a person

305
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:08,223
I don't know there's a little disrespect that's what I remember you

306
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:08,991
So

307
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:13,599
Camp stuff Rodger doesn't remember that meeting so I'm going to go ahead and take that off the table

308
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:17,952
In 1996 Rodger was working on The Bob Dole campaign

309
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:24,352
And things got a little messy when the National Enquirer reported on how he posted ads and scandalous pictures of himself and his

310
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:26,144
Wife in swingers magazine

311
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,680
And online looking to get

312
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,704
Some fun going

313
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:32,032
Rodger initially blamed it imaginary assistant for post

314
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:34,592
The ads but eventually cop to the fact that he'd done it

315
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:38,688
When he finally did come clean he was still kind of a weasel about it saying quote

316
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:45,088
When that whole thing hit the fan in 1996 the reason I gave a blanket denial visit my grandparents were still alive

317
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:48,160
I'm not guilty of hypocrisy

318
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,208
Breakfast

319
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,512
You're being hypocritical in that

320
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:57,632
This is a bit of a scandal because it was 1996

321
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:02,240
To the right-wing attacks on Bill Clinton had to do with him and his women womanizer

322
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:06,592
So this would be a bad luck Ford old I was senior advisor who was out swinging

323
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:10,176
Particularly considering that according to the Chicago Tribune

324
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,712
Rodger was part of Bob Dole

325
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:14,272
Clinton accountability team

326
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:18,880
Endless by September of 96 Rodger had stepped down from the Dole campaign

327
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:25,792
I don't really care about Rodger swinging his business but his response to the Inquirer stories

328
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,072
Speaks a lot to his character

329
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,864
I understand the culture wasn't

330
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,680
Accepting of people live in alternative Lifestyles at that point

331
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:35,520
But the length of you want to pretend that he's been set up we're pretty ridiculous

332
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:42,688
Anyway Rodger threatened to sue The Inquirer and Larry klayman was his lawyer night

333
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:47,040
That was where Rodger is saying their paths first crossed

334
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:53,696
But because there was no imagine perpetrator to sue here Rogers lying about that and there was no libel on the part of the

335
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:56,256
Enquirer this case went nowhere and Rodger

336
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:58,304
Took a pretty big hit to his credibility

337
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:03,424
Consider he was a College Dropout who went to work on shady s*** for Richard Nixon

338
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,960
He'd work for Reagan

339
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,752
Use an advisor for Bob Dole

340
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,032
These has big lead

341
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:10,080
In the GOP circles politics

342
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:13,408
But after the Scandal he went down the fight card a little bit

343
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,992
His profile just didn't match with presidential candidates and us

344
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:23,136
In 2004 Rodger was enlisted to advise a certain candidate on their run for a Florida seat in the US Senate

345
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:29,280
That candidate was Larry klayman goddamn these people

346
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:35,936
Is it okay for the claiming to be questioning him in this deposition is that even okay

347
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,984
Comical

348
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:44,384
Good long time with people who have known each other who do not like each other try

349
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,224
To Pretend There's Something formality

350
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:54,880
Larry would end up with 1.1% of the vote in the Republican primary putting him in a very respectable 7th place

351
00:23:55,648 --> 00:24:01,792
A Sun Sentinel article about the candidates and their primary include the section about claimant where you Compares himself to Abraham Lincoln and

352
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:02,560
Ronald Reagan

353
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,864
Any policy set is described as quote

354
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,168
He Advocates abolishing the IRS

355
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:12,544
The forcible removal of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro

356
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,848
Okay

357
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:17,664
Would he be administered

358
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:24,320
Sleeps Chatterbox had an article about his Senate run which was mostly about how even back then he had a bit of a reputation

359
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,600
For being wildly litigious

360
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:31,232
The piece ends quote for Chatterbox though there's only one issue in the Larry klayman campaign

361
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:37,888
If elected will he pledged not to file any lawsuits for the next 6 years

362
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:43,264
Will he decides not to sue anyone for the duration of his Senate campaign

363
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,544
No

364
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,080
It's a free country

365
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:53,504
Pictures of man who like suing people he doesn't even want anything out of it he just likes filling out that paperwork

366
00:24:54,016 --> 00:25:00,160
Deposing people who have no business being used as a weapon

367
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,464
Is 2004 run on the nation

368
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:09,376
According to this article Larry's Adventures at Judicial Watch where he would file tons of lawsuits mostly against people in the Clinton

369
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:12,448
Norbit never funded by Richard Mellon scaife

370
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:14,240
The right-wing billionaire megiddo

371
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:19,360
According to this article claim and sought funding from scaife for his Senate run

372
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,896
In a letter that said quote

373
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:24,992
As a sender I will have considerable powers that I did not have a Judicial Watch

374
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:29,344
Including the ability to investigate and prosecute in the Senate Hillary Clinton

375
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,928
Much like Richard Nixon did with the Communist spy Alger Hiss

376
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,768
If I'm some day to run for president I need the credentials to do so

377
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:42,400
Being a senator will provide me with this possible

378
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:48,032
To desire somebody to be president less than Trump but I will be God damned if claiming would be worse at his job

379
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,568
This was part of a multi-state

380
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:53,664
Plot that was the result in Hillary being tried in the Senate and Larry klayman is present

381
00:25:54,432 --> 00:26:00,576
It should be pointed out that escape spokesperson told the nation quote he has not given a dime to

382
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:01,856
Mister Clemens camp

383
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,904
I didn't fact he discouraged him from running

384
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,928
Well that's probably

385
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:11,328
Anyway this nation articles mostly about the question of whether or not soliciting this loan would constitute a campaign fine

386
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,352
Finance violation

387
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:16,192
But seeing as it was sixteen years ago I'm not really going to get bogged down in that question

388
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,472
Sean my really interested

389
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,240
The answer is

390
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:24,896
The important thing for us today is that the reason that Larry needed money is because the only way he could fund his campaign was through

391
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,944
Listing donations through direct mailing

392
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:31,808
And he didn't have access to a large database of names in order to Target those mainland

393
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,856
When you're in that situation

394
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,904
You know you don't have a giant mailing list

395
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,976
You need to pay for access to other people's lists of names

396
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:43,584
As claiming was doing with the lift held by American Target advertising

397
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,656
The problem was according to this article

398
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:53,056
That he was spending almost as much as he was bringing in with his strategy so that wasn't going to cut it and that doesn't

399
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,080
Seemed like a good

400
00:26:54,336 --> 00:27:00,480
Breaking even on campaign Finance donations is not good so you need to reach out to a billionaire mega-donor

401
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:04,064
Have them pay for the list or something and then you end up making whatever

402
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,880
Or have 60 billion dollars yourself that also works

403
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:13,280
Anyway throughout the rest of Rogers deposition he and Larry getting to a number of fights about this 2004 campaign

404
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:19,936
Rogers position seems to be that Larry led him to believe that he had access to the Judicial Watch mailing list which would have

405
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,472
Help make his campaign viable

406
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,496
But he did not

407
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,824
Rodger felt misled and like his time was being wasted

408
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:32,224
Conversely Larry keeps a legend that Rodger stash door computers that he bought with his own money when they left his campaign

409
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:42,208
I believe both of them I'm not sure who I believe and ultimately I really don't care

410
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:49,376
But I wanted to walk you through a bit of this history of top because the clips of them arguing about this stuff they're not really useful for our purposes

411
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:51,936
Cuz there's like a little interjections and like

412
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:57,568
They're in the middle of a different question about why'd you steal like computers

413
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,848
It's not

414
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:03,712
Right it's not as out of nowhere and fighting is that might make you think but it just

415
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,040
It wouldn't have been a I don't think I would been able to prevent it

416
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,832
Spike Lee

417
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:15,488
But you kind of need to know about that stuff in order to understand that these dudes have a long deep history and clearly

418
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:17,024
Leave f****** hate each other

419
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,816
You stole my computers

420
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:23,680
It's so fun

421
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:27,008
So it starts out you know

422
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:31,104
Not great Tony the adversarial provide asked

423
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,128
You're aware that

424
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,760
They must not have been any phone record

425
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:38,528
Produce

426
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:42,624
Cuz you're aware that it

427
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:45,952
I believe the text messages

428
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:47,488
Emails

429
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,512
Yes

430
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:50,560
Are you working

431
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,328
Convicted

432
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,352
Of not providing a

433
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,936
That is untrue

434
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,216
Chakra

435
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,776
That charge was drawing but go ahead

436
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:01,056
And yours actually

437
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:01,824
Set letters

438
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:03,616
Congress

439
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:04,896
On your behalf

440
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,176
Did not have.

441
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:07,968
Attraction

442
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:08,992
Instructing

443
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,488
Want to make sure he's aware

444
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,096
I'm well aware

445
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:25,888
You learned the hard way

446
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,168
Objection

447
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,520
Delusional that I have to be back

448
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,056
Michael luzier

449
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,336
Indicative

450
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,360
7 count

451
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:37,152
I'm not going to answer that question

452
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:42,784
Already get the sense of this needling like there's a strategy that Larry's using it's clearly like

453
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:48,416
I'm going to get him to yell at night

454
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:54,816
You can't handle the truth strategies going to try and piss him off until he admits it will then that's a dumb strategy

455
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:58,400
Going both ways

456
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:01,472
It develops more into Rodger just f****** with him

457
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:06,336
Has like a little bit of time going to be obviously

458
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:07,616
Just like

459
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,920
Poke poke poke

460
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:16,320
You're delusional piece of s*** how about that did you tell me delusional piece of s*** now I didn't call you why would you hear that

461
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:22,720
Hear that if you are delusional piece of s*** and Rogers lawyers trying to make clear wreck right out of the gate

462
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:27,840
Not answering any questions about criminal matters and Larry keeps trying to get

463
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,376
Questions in or like

464
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:32,960
References to the Mueller investigation which should

465
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:33,728
Be off-limits

466
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:38,336
For the purposes of this but it is

467
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:40,384
Keeps happening what computers

468
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:41,664
Did

469
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,432
The FBI

470
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,200
Take

471
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:45,248
Ocean computers

472
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,784
We're not answering these questions

473
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:48,832
This is relevant to.

474
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,624
Are you tired

475
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,696
You're going to

476
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,072
No you're going to wind up getting sent to me

477
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:00,096
So let's go

478
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:03,424
Why not

479
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:07,776
Yes I am

480
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:15,712
That was that was one of my first big laughs when Rogers like I'm not to be pageant

481
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,272
This is breathing life into by

482
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:24,672
Cold broken heart amazing wait for it you have no idea how badly the superior race

483
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,440
No good

484
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,720
So

485
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:27,744
You know

486
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,144
There's there's just a clear town of like f*** this guy

487
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:40,288
It must be so fun to be Rogers lawyer

488
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:43,360
So your entire day is devoted just telling him to shut up

489
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:47,968
This beginning portion here that where it has to do with like document production

490
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:52,064
You heard him asking about like what computers there were and then goes on

491
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,600
And Suzanne

492
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,392
The question comes up of like

493
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,160
Notes

494
00:31:56,416 --> 00:32:00,512
But handwritten notes to work product what's relevant to the

495
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:05,120
Like them for this cuz this this is a this is another big laugh

496
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:06,400
Keep notes yourself

497
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:09,472
Not on any of these matters

498
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,032
I might make a grocery list two dozen

499
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,080
They never write anything

500
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,176
But not pretending anything

501
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,200
We're here to discuss

502
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,528
All that in right now

503
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,392
Did I write that down

504
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:33,792
Well truth is not Pluto

505
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,352
Someday we will

506
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:38,400
This will work

507
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,728
That is the best

508
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:45,568
Did you write down

509
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:47,616
Truth is

510
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,992
Oh yeah

511
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:57,600
That is just breathe

512
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:00,160
Bob YouTube

513
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:02,208
God dammit Rodger

514
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:07,840
So one of the things Larry is taking issue with and he thinks his defamatory

515
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:14,240
Is it Rodger went on Infowars and he said that Larry's never won a case in his life and then

516
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:17,312
He's a loser

517
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:20,384
The issue of him being the loser keeps coming up

518
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,152
And one

519
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,944
You know obvious questions

520
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,224
Larry would have his

521
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,784
If I'm a loser why did you work with me

522
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,856
On my campaign for the Senate

523
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,136
I think Rogers just

524
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,160
Taunting him

525
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,696
Are you in a representative

526
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:34,720
Is a loser Wiki

527
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:39,072
I thought the dude

528
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:41,120
If you had the money could be liable Canada

529
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:42,400
Loser

530
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,168
You can't win

531
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:46,496
Know that money

532
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,288
Luther Goodwin

533
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:51,872
You're not a loser cannot win unless they have money

534
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,920
This is what Define loser

535
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,456
Your contacts.

536
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,224
Loses

537
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:57,248
Repeatedly

538
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,552
Littleton.

539
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,280
How did you do in Centerville

540
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,376
Next to you

541
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,704
Larry

542
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,616
Where's that list that list Larry

543
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:29,760
Children wear on a goddamn playground what are we doing here there Underoath

544
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:37,952
I'm not a loser am I know you are a loser no I'm not. Thanks to you.

545
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:38,976
Thanks to you

546
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:47,680
So Larry is pissed because Rodger was working on his Senate campaign

547
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:50,752
I need the time from what Larry saying it seems like

548
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:54,848
He had an understanding or belief that Rodger was going to be an exclusive

549
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,640
Employee for him

550
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:59,456
Sure on his campaign

551
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:03,808
Now Rodger also at the time was apparently advising Al Sharpe

552
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,416
Who was running for Democratic candidate

553
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,696
Our president

554
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,744
And so this is

555
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,512
Problem

556
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,280
For Larry

557
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:17,120
Because there's no exclusivity in your going around

558
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:19,680
Get the Sharpton and we still talking about the lawsuit happening

559
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:20,960
About what happened to 29

560
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:22,240
Antichrist

561
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:28,896
And where the deposition talking about Al Sharpton campaign is not relevant

562
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,176
Not relevant

563
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:34,016
He's mad that Rodger was giving advice to Sharpton

564
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:36,832
Rodger insist he wasn't working for Sharp

565
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:40,160
Larry said some bad things about Al Sharpton

566
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,208
And what did you do after we parted

567
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,304
Network router

568
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:56,032
Never Shout Never consulted his a friend of mine and give me advice when he asked for

569
00:35:58,592 --> 00:35:59,104
Do you have

570
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,384
They're basically race

571
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,152
Is baiting vigil

572
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:05,248
Does your friend

573
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,552
Imagina forum

574
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,976
I'm afraid in case you

575
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,000
The famed

576
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,864
Hindi film you either

577
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:23,424
That's what you think

578
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:25,984
Didgeridoo

579
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,264
I doubt it

580
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:34,688
Larry Mahan

581
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:41,088
Somehow in a deposition talking about Rodger Stone defaming you you have to be a racist towards Alice

582
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:47,488
Sharpton for no reason and I don't know if it does rise to the level of defamation calling him a race-baiting extort

583
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:50,560
Fortunate on Fox News

584
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:53,120
Underoath

585
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:59,520
Weird that is weird weird thing to say but my favorite thing at the end there is one Larry's like willetta

586
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,056
A jury decided Rogers like

587
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,848
I doubt it I doubt it

588
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:05,920
Not going to have a buddy that keeps happening in this deposition

589
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:08,992
Like Larry Jose decide this and Rogers like

590
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:09,760
I doubt it

591
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:15,136
Because he doesn't think this is going to get to trial which I kind of think is probably about right that's about right

592
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:21,536
Larry whoever thinks that Rodger saying I doubt it because he has no faith in the legal process isn't she

593
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:23,328
About the Court's ruling

594
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:29,984
But in reality Rogers just telling this case stinks and he's f****** with him tonight cuz never going anywhere

595
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,544
Eat my hat and go to prison for exactly 40 mod

596
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,616
The Psycho Drama that's going on is just

597
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:36,640
Fantastic

598
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:40,736
It's very boring to watch all of it but it's really fun

599
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:45,088
In little bit down it's good

600
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:48,672
Goddamn there like an hour long stretch of boring nothing

601
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:49,952
I'm toad

602
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:54,304
Eastpointe Larry starts to sort of layout why some of this is relevant

603
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,840
So there's that ugliness

604
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:57,632
That happened back in

605
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:02,752
2004 penny with running for the Senate and apparently Rogers people stole those computers

606
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:07,616
And this is informing Rogers beliefs in the present day

607
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:10,688
There's a couple quotes about this that I think we'll like

608
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:16,576
Really start to thread the needle cuz I know it doesn't make sense now but it should

609
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,344
Why did you refer

610
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:20,928
Suspect because you did something I didn't like

611
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:21,696
What did I do

612
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:25,280
So you

613
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,072
Negative statement

614
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,096
Somebody even if you

615
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:28,864
I don't know whether any

616
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:32,192
Opinion it's some

617
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,472
Free country

618
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,752
So just came out of the blue

619
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,800
Don't recall what prompts

620
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,360
In fact you thought somehow that I was

621
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:40,384
Threat to you

622
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:41,408
Something

623
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,432
With regard to

624
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:43,968
Special counsel Robert

625
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:44,736
Molars

626
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:46,784
So-called Russian

627
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,552
Collusion

628
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:50,880
Not going to answer

629
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,184
You're concerned

630
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,208
About

631
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:55,488
My

632
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,280
Experience with you at

633
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,048
The time

634
00:38:59,072 --> 00:38:59,584
That you were

635
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:01,376
Consulting on

636
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:04,704
Conjecture on your part

637
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:06,240
You were concerned it

638
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:08,800
But your staff had misappropriated

639
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,592
Computers and cell phone

640
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:11,872
And the life which I

641
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:16,224
Absolutely not and I don't know that there's any proof of that

642
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:22,880
So he is saying that you Rodger to be on Infowars because

643
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:29,280
Cuz you knew that I didn't like you cuz your staff still computers

644
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:35,680
I was a threat because I work with Mueller

645
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:36,448
South movie

646
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:42,848
Situation right here where it's it's like the hateful eight they're just sitting across the table at each other talking forever

647
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:45,408
It's very strange because I think

648
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,176
That like

649
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:49,760
You know

650
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:51,808
Rodger I bet he's confused

651
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:54,624
Through a bit of this

652
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,696
The connections the claimants trying to make between stuff is just

653
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:00,512
Just like where is any proof of the dab

654
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:01,536
Also

655
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:02,560
Larry

656
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:05,120
Why did you say

657
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:12,288
Why did Rodger say mean things about you on are with everybody everybody

658
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:18,688
How would you expect him to act you knew him in 2004 newham from 88 on Jack Kemp

659
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:22,784
You know you don't care what you were his lawyer in 96

660
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,368
When he lying about somebody posted those pictures

661
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:29,696
You know it you know you got it.

662
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:32,000
So you ask a question like that

663
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:37,888
So he takes another swing climate another swing at that you were worried about me working with Mueller

664
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,704
And that's why when I got involved with corsi

665
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,240
As his lawyer

666
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,776
You there you got

667
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:44,800
Rogers doesn't

668
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,336
Even care about this because

669
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,104
It's just

670
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,896
Larry saying things

671
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,688
You were concerned

672
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,224
I didn't like

673
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,112
Particular

674
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:00,416
Admit doesn't confirm one way or another

675
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,952
If you were concerned that I was angry

676
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:05,792
Legitly

677
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:10,912
Sharpen knives I was angry at you but that's okay

678
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,960
Because the number of amiss

679
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:15,264
Statements in falsehoods that you

680
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,288
Tomei

681
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:18,080
Regarding your ability to raise money

682
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:26,016
Money is important in terms of getting you elected to the second guess you never do not work for me

683
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:28,832
You never paid me a dime

684
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:31,904
Are you violated my

685
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:38,304
I trusted you not

686
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:44,704
This is ridiculous

687
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,288
It is and it turns f****** ugly

688
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:50,592
In his next life

689
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:51,360
The others

690
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:55,199
The defamatory what are the statements is the claimant hasn't won any cases

691
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,735
And it turns out he has

692
00:41:56,991 --> 00:42:01,855
And Rogers like wow is my sense that you hadn't

693
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:06,463
I bet it turns into a very nasty insults

694
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:07,487
He

695
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:08,255
He's

696
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:10,815
Claimant never actually want a courtroom victory

697
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,631
I believe sunetra I believe that to be true

698
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:14,399
What's the time now

699
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,423
Now

700
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:17,215
You never did any research did you do

701
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:19,007
To find out whether that was true or not before you met

702
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:24,383
But in fact you actually did know that I had

703
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:25,919
No actually I did

704
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:26,943
Were you wouldn't have

705
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:27,967
Wanted to be my

706
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:28,991
So cold

707
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:29,759
Consultant in the

708
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:32,319
That was a long time before the

709
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:37,951
USA 132 pennistone says

710
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:38,719
Does he mean

711
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:40,511
Clean was ousted its Judicial Watch

712
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:42,815
Ask Tom fitton why he left

713
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,351
He was ousted because of

714
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,375
Sexual

715
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:47,679
Yes I've heard that

716
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:48,703
And where did you hear that

717
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:49,471
Don't recall

718
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:52,287
You heard it from fitting

719
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:54,847
I most certainly did not

720
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,639
But you don't remember where you heard

721
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:59,711
I don't know what her but I that told you previously I've never spoken

722
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:01,503
Anytime Fitness other than the one time

723
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:02,783
In passing weeks

724
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:06,623
Disgusting

725
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:07,391
We did not

726
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:10,207
So you just believe that out of

727
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,231
At the cosmos

728
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:13,279
You know how politicians

729
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:18,143
Take me about something like that

730
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:20,959
Why would you leave an organization if you found it

731
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:22,495
Who talked

732
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:25,311
I don't recall you don't recall

733
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,687
You're about to be absent from the bar

734
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:31,967
Stop

735
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:36,319
Have fun watching your own children lyrics

736
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,855
I read the Court's decision

737
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:43,999
F*** you

738
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:52,959
Bad start for a break that's what that's what that's it

739
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:58,079
Good exit line normal conversation after that

740
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:59,103
No

741
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:03,199
I tried to look into that and that has something to do with

742
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:09,599
Divorce filing Bob & Larry's past I have no idea what the circumstances that are

743
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,135
Go anywhere

744
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:17,535
The only explanation I can find for that sexual harassment business comes from a 2009 lawsuit that Larry

745
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:21,375
Had filed against Judicial Watch and its new president Tom fitton

746
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:25,983
It was arranged a lawsuit claiming breach-of-contract defamation and other such grievances

747
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:32,895
Part of Larry's argument was that fitton and Judicial Watch it committed fraud in the trial because they had testified that he

748
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:34,431
He was outed from Judicial Watch

749
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:36,991
Because of a sexual harassment claim but

750
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:39,551
Larry had a deposition from Tom fitton

751
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:43,903
Saying that Larry was not quote ousted as a result of a sexual harassment complaint

752
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,975
This argument did not move the court

753
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:48,767
From the memorandum opinion in the

754
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:49,535
Text quote

755
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:55,935
Claimant has not identified any of fittings testimony at trial contradicting to quote a deposition testimony or suggesting

756
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:59,263
The claimant was quote outed as a result of a sexual harassment complaint

757
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:05,919
He references only testimony of Paul or fenity used in addressing mr. affinities is

758
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:07,967
Understanding of why climate

759
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:08,735
Judicial Watch

760
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:15,647
Nowhere in his testimony did mister or vanities state that claiming left Judicial Watch due to a sexual harassment

761
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:19,743
He testified the claim and left Judicial Watch in part to avoid quote

762
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:22,815
An internal investigation into whether he claiming

763
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:26,143
Pursued an inappropriate relationship with an employee

764
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:29,727
And at most explain his concern the Judicial Watch Might

765
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:33,055
Have been subject to sexual harassment allegations

766
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:34,591
Based on that alleged relationship

767
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:35,359
Gotcha

768
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:38,943
It seems like this is the best explanation I can find for that situation

769
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:43,295
It looks like it's a thing where Paul orfanidis who was a lawyer Judicial Watch

770
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:46,623
I testified The Clement had a relationship with an employee

771
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:48,671
But didn't say that there was a sexual harassment

772
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:49,439
Complained

773
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:52,767
It seems like maybe this became a bit of a game of telephone from there

774
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:55,071
Since claiming got a bit defensive about it in the court

775
00:45:56,095 --> 00:46:02,239
Part of claimant claim of defamation against Rodger is that Rodger said on Infowars that he was ousted adjective

776
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:06,079
Watch ask Tom fitton why you left you without it because of sexual harassment

777
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:08,895
Which is not something Rodger could probably

778
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:09,663
Substantiate

779
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:13,247
That does make it an inaccurate statement presented as fact

780
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:16,319
But I also don't know if Larry can prove that Rodger didn't

781
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:18,111
No it was true when he said it

782
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:23,487
It's really hard thing to tell with an a****** like Rodger

783
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:27,839
Repeated a bunch of places it took a while to find that paste

784
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:30,399
Where that this like this probably came from

785
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:37,311
But I mean the rumor has been bandied about for a while little bit late to claim now that's Rodger death

786
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:41,919
Definitively knew that that wasn't the case whenever he said that since the rumor was everywhere

787
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:47,551
Yeah I don't know if it's because Larry Clemens also a public figure in as much as he's

788
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:51,135
You know Sudan every Democratic politician ever

789
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,159
It would be very

790
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:55,231
I think it would be pretty difficult to demonstrate actual malice there

791
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:59,839
Which is kind of one of the benefits I guess to being like Rodger and just

792
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:02,655
But having malice towards everyone

793
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:03,935
So

794
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:07,519
It's almost

795
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:10,591
If you had to determine whether or not he had malice in court

796
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:14,431
It's like it gets down to whether or not he can even feel in the first

797
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:15,711
Like you don't even

798
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:18,271
Is EZ a psychopathic robot you

799
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:21,343
Oh no he's just going to claim whatever you see is just a little

800
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:25,439
So you have them going out to break with

801
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:31,839
If you know Rodger accusing claim of abusing his four children at L-A himself

802
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:37,471
Break on that one nugget is an episode of Modern Family are hard to break

803
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:40,799
Okay

804
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:42,847
The tone is just

805
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:48,991
I would I would like to say work will come back tomorrow

806
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:54,111
Don't know why YouTube Larry get another lawyer

807
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:57,951
Defendant Stone

808
00:47:59,487 --> 00:47:59,999
Called me a piece

809
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:00,767
Garbage can

810
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,351
If this is accurate transcript yes

811
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,399
Constitutionally protected

812
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:07,167
Dupree speech

813
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:09,215
You make it a practice

814
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:09,983
Disappointing people

815
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,519
Garbage

816
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:19,199
One of the points where I start thinking that maybe this is not a strong-looking soup

817
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:25,087
What are the things that Larry wants to ask Rodger about his Rodger calling him a piece of garbage I have no idea what's even going on

818
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:29,439
I can't imagine a reality where you can get sued for defamation because you call someone garbage

819
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:34,815
It seems like that would be presuming that you think the person is making the factual claim that you are in fact

820
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:35,583
Garbage

821
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:39,167
And also that you know the claim is false at the time you're making it

822
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:42,495
It's so easy to say that this is an insult and a statement of opinion

823
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:44,287
It just strikes me that this is like

824
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:47,359
If this is on your list of defamatory things Rodger said

825
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:48,127
It's a badly

826
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:50,175
This is silly

827
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:51,455
Rodger

828
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,063
Did you call me a

829
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:56,831
A doo doo head

830
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:01,951
Answer the question

831
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:05,535
So it is next do we get to the question of

832
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:10,655
Clements IQ which is been attacked by Rodger

833
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:13,215
For those people out there who

834
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:13,983
Thank

835
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:16,287
The Larry claim his IQ is higher than 70

836
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:20,383
Maybe I write yes if it if this is an accurate transcription

837
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:22,687
Again my opinion

838
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:23,711
Statement is it

839
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:24,479
Did not sit

840
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:25,759
I don't have an ID

841
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:27,551
IQ higher than 72 pinion

842
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:30,623
This this is just not going to fly

843
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:32,671
Larry if you're trying to prove

844
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:35,231
I'm wrong this is the wrong way to go about

845
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:36,767
This just doesn't seem like

846
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:38,815
Got like those statements are

847
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:41,631
Very easily depicted as opinion

848
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:42,655
I don't

849
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:44,703
I don't know anyway

850
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:46,239
There's a list of insult

851
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:52,895
But Larry has a rapid fire

852
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:54,943
It's not it's not a huge listing it

853
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:56,735
It's not really that

854
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:57,503
Great

855
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:59,551
But the way Rodger responds to it is

856
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:00,319
Is just like

857
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:01,087
So good

858
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:01,855
At 1

859
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:05,183
The clock you also published

860
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:07,743
Quote to be clear Larry klayman is a moron

861
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:10,559
He's never won a case

862
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:12,095
In court in his life

863
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:14,399
He may have one if you motions

864
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:16,703
Is a lightweight he's a know-nothing

865
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:20,543
The statement said I never won a case

866
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:23,103
You had to look back into my record

867
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,127
As a lawyer

868
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:24,895
Correct

869
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:26,175
Well that's the impression I had

870
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:34,623
I believe that to be sure it's time I saw you

871
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:35,647
The other things I said

872
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:52,799
Just a moron.

873
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:54,591
Lightweight no nothing

874
00:50:58,175 --> 00:51:00,223
That's so funny

875
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:03,039
So Larry

876
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:06,367
If you get this next cookies trying to like play like he's sneaky

877
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:12,511
That's serving Rodger with the the papers for the lawsuit

878
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:17,631
The cases that were most certainly did not

879
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:20,703
You tempted happy service

880
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:23,007
And I don't think you were successful but I've accepted

881
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:23,775
Service

882
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:24,799
At home

883
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:27,103
I ended public events for all of your suits

884
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:30,687
I had to get you at a strip club you tried

885
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:37,599
What a response to that what a response I just love that you

886
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:41,183
Nothing none of the other details that could be important there

887
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:43,487
Are all of them are wiped Away by just

888
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:48,863
You didn't do it buddy you missed

889
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,911
So now the issue of Cassandra Fairbanks

890
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:53,215
Thanks comes up

891
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:54,751
Wedding writer of

892
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:56,799
Of those sorts and news

893
00:51:57,055 --> 00:52:00,383
You know she's right for like Gateway pundit I believe now

894
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:04,479
Maybe doesn't anymore but did I don't know who cares I don't I've not kept up too much

895
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:05,759
With her butt

896
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:07,807
She

897
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:11,135
Is it is is factored into this because

898
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:12,671
She did some

899
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:16,255
Stories may be negative about Jerome corsi

900
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:21,887
Around this time and like when on Newsmax and talked bad about course Isha

901
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:24,447
And Larry's implication is

902
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:30,847
Rodger told her to do this which would be a problem probably because

903
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,127
You know it

904
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:34,431
Yeah

905
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,199
Yeah

906
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:40,319
But he doesn't have any evidence that he's just trying to make this claim and thinking Rodger Libby like you got me

907
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,855
Craigslist Fairbanks

908
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:46,207
You've had discussions with her about dr. Jerome corsi having on

909
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:50,815
I don't recall any specific conversation with her about.

910
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:53,631
You just can't recall

911
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:59,007
Pacific Lumber

912
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:00,031
Regarding doctor

913
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,615
Hey where's the clintons so used to

914
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:04,383
Say

915
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:05,407
We have no space

916
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:06,431
Pacific recollection

917
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:08,735
No but it's not bad

918
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:09,503
Caprese

919
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:15,647
In this case that would be the case I would never would mean that you might have some recollection but you just don't remember now

920
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:16,671
Know what

921
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:20,767
But I don't recall ever having any conversation with Cassandra

922
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:22,303
Regarding.

923
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:24,607
So did that

924
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:27,935
Going to be a problem for the argument that he did

925
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:28,959
Is what

926
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:32,799
Unless you have some sort of an indication and evidence

927
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:35,103
An email from her to him but like

928
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:41,503
Hiyori him sending her an email that said hate auction on Coursey for me

929
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:43,295
Evidence and it does not seem like there is any

930
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:45,855
So just like hey did you do this no

931
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,135
Thank you did

932
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:53,535
Rodger

933
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:54,815
No clue

934
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:57,887
Canalis turns into like a really weird thing

935
00:53:58,143 --> 00:53:59,423
Where

936
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:00,703
Where

937
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:02,239
I don't know how any of this is relevant

938
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:06,079
But claiming start stalking weird stuff about Cassandra Fairbanks

939
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:08,383
Free weather photos of Cassandra Fairbanks

940
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:09,407
The internet

941
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:14,015
Mayweather

942
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:15,807
Her photos of her and another

943
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:17,087
Contacts on the internet

944
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:19,391
No I'm not

945
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:23,487
I have no idea what any colors that was a

946
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:25,535
Hypothetical nude pictures or

947
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:28,863
Risque pictures Fairbanks existing online

948
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:29,887
What they have

949
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:30,655
To do with this

950
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:33,215
At all

951
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:35,007
An ideal situation

952
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:36,543
It's a waste of a question

953
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:37,823
It's a waste of time

954
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:39,615
It doesn't seem to go anywhere

955
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:42,687
But this also leads into

956
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:44,479
I didn't know this

957
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:47,295
I'm not a maybe I didn't I just didn't care I don't know

958
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:49,343
But apparently Jerome corsi

959
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:50,367
His said

960
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:55,487
The Cassandra Fairbanks told him that she slept with Julian Assange

961
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:56,767
In the embassy

962
00:54:57,535 --> 00:55:02,143
The Ecuadorian Embassy

963
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:08,799
All right till we get to talking about that a little bit here I still don't know what is going on

964
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:09,567
I have no idea

965
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:10,591
115

966
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:11,871
And Cassandra Fairbanks

967
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:12,895
Cuz she had had

968
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:14,687
Julia song

969
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:17,247
That's

970
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:19,807
I don't know if we've ever discussed that other than the fact

971
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:20,575
She has

972
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:22,111
A concern for his

973
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:23,135
Wellbeing

974
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:26,207
When she visited him in the embassy

975
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:28,511
London

976
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:29,279
I've read that

977
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:30,559
Are you aware that she

978
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:31,583
Call dr. corsi

979
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:36,191
I saw our doctor Coursey

980
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:37,471
Alleged that but I don't know

981
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:39,263
Where did you see that

982
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,031
Reddit somewhere

983
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:42,335
She told you that

984
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:50,271
You put her up to the fame doctor course he'll news

985
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:51,551
I most certainly did not

986
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:54,111
The evidence of that

987
00:55:54,879 --> 00:56:01,023
You'd already asked and made that bad bad it's very weird

988
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:02,303
Strategy

989
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:06,655
I don't first of all I think if you're trying to go up against someone like Rodger Stone

990
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:10,495
Not effective strategy not going to do it relishes

991
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:15,103
Yeah you are you are firmly in Rodger Stones territory

992
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:15,871
Yeah

993
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:20,223
I don't know even in another circumstance if that would be a good strategy

994
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:21,503
It seems like

995
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:27,903
No he's a decent lawyer working with Rodger could get anything that's said in the Septuagint

996
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:34,303
Reedley taken out of court. It's being shown here with the arguing and the

997
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:37,631
And then we talked about about other

998
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:42,495
Antiparticle

999
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:44,799
Faceless urchins of just like

1000
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:46,847
Did you where'd you hear that

1001
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:47,615
Who told you

1002
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:51,455
Who told you you put her up to this

1003
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:57,599
This is a stretch

1004
00:56:58,111 --> 00:57:00,927
Okay parently Rogers

1005
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:02,463
He doesn't ask

1006
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:04,255
The Rodger

1007
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:06,815
He asked Rodger

1008
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:12,447
About something that you said about Jerome corsi which was essentially if you see his lips moving you know he's lying

1009
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:13,215
Yes

1010
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:16,543
Larry common thing it's an old idiot

1011
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:18,591
Larry thinks that's about him

1012
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:19,871
Even though

1013
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:24,223
Rodger was talking about Jerome corsi explanation for this

1014
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:24,991
It's wild

1015
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:31,391
Target 22 at 6:26 in the Infowars video to Publishers that quote you can always tell when Jerry

1016
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:32,415
Line

1017
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:34,463
Because his lips are moving on quote

1018
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:40,095
We had just said on the

1019
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:42,911
Previous notice goes beyond what you claim was

1020
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:43,935
Specifically

1021
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:46,239
That he lies anytime if he says anything

1022
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:48,543
I think he told multiple lies

1023
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:49,823
Tell you the truth but

1024
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:51,871
But yes I definitely said that

1025
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:53,407
You can leave him at Total Wine

1026
00:57:53,919 --> 00:58:00,063
I think you lied on some occasions here yet

1027
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:00,831
But I said yeah

1028
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:06,207
Expression is frequently used with regard to lawyers isn't it how do you tell a lawyer's line is lips

1029
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:09,023
Adduction of Foreigner

1030
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:11,071
So you're also referring to me weren't you

1031
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:14,399
Wild conjecture on your part on his lawyer

1032
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:19,775
Wild conjecture on your part where he wears lawyer

1033
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:22,335
That's a phrase that used with lower

1034
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:29,247
It doesn't say that you're putting words in my mouth

1035
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:33,343
Testify truthfully

1036
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:34,111
Alyssa

1037
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:35,391
Stop

1038
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:37,183
You got to stop at your comment

1039
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:44,351
You asked for it

1040
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:45,375
Appetite

1041
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:52,031
God always just imagine there goes on inside like official places like courtrooms and depositions is

1042
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:52,799
Just like really

1043
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:59,455
Ridgid by-the-book serious people sometimes it's just like this

1044
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:02,271
I just want

1045
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:04,319
I can't get enough of Larry

1046
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:07,647
It listing insults it Rogers

1047
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:09,951
Just like I wanted to go down to lose like

1048
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:13,279
February 2nd you said I'm a sad sad

1049
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:15,327
You called me a rat face motherfuker

1050
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:16,863
Do I have a red face

1051
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:23,519
Not constitutionally protected free speech in my opinion it's my opinion that

1052
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:27,359
All right. You know how it goes in politics to your thing

1053
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:29,919
So another thing

1054
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:35,295
That Rodger has said that is of issue is that he is implied that to Jerome corsi is an alcoholic

1055
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:40,159
Just got that client here a little bit

1056
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:42,463
Of course

1057
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:44,767
If you say so I don't

1058
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:46,047
Specifically

1059
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:48,351
Again you're calling him

1060
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:51,423
I'm drunk with him

1061
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:58,847
I have some personal experience where I've seen him carried out of a restaurant

1062
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:00,127
Stone drunk yeah

1063
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:00,895
What does mean

1064
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:02,175
That you're not coholic

1065
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:02,943
Did you were drunk

1066
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:09,855
GM drunk on more than one occasion

1067
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:11,647
Inebriated

1068
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:16,767
The issue he said it was talking about something they Kursi

1069
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:19,327
Said he said that him saying this

1070
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:25,727
Is only proof of him having an alcohol affected memory

1071
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:30,335
Mission of like he's an alcoholic

1072
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:36,735
Is memorii in my estimation may be affected by alcohol so easy to get around these things

1073
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:37,759
This is weak bulshit

1074
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:40,575
I hate to say it but I'm on Rodger

1075
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:41,599
Stoneside here

1076
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:43,647
Larry Glazer

1077
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:47,231
Larry gets to asking about like a

Your bank accounts you know all this end the Rogers lawyer is no we're not doing Financial discover

1079
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:55,423

01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:56,703
Do you have Altra Bank

1081
01:00:57,727 --> 01:01:00,031

You keep resources

1084

Gold bars

1085
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:15,903
We're not we're not work this is not Financial

1086
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:17,951
Discover you have no right to ask this question

1087
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:19,999
Subjection

1088
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:21,023
Ask relevant

1089
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:24,607
Do you have a Krugerrand Scott this

1090
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:29,471
This Rogers lawyer is so sick of Larry he's just sitting here like

1091
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:33,567
He's like trying to be an adult in her in the room and it's just pathetic

1092
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:40,223
It's just so sad what's up you've also got Rodger who can't resist activate

1093
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:44,063
Tell him to go f*** off every now and again play with him a little bit

1094
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:45,343
And you can't like usual

1095
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,367
It don't answer that

1096
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:50,463
Alright whatever the only person who should feel bad for being in that room is Rogers

1097
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:52,767
That is that is a bummer for him

1098
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:56,095
So there is a story that was published in the daily

1099
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:57,375
Free caller about

1100
01:01:57,631 --> 01:02:01,727
Jerome corsi Larry is sort of asserting

1101
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:05,055
That implying or trying to

1102
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:09,919
Make the accusation that Rodger planted the story against Jerome corsi

1103
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:11,967
In this clip

1104
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:18,367
He's talking about knowing a lawyer that's associated with one of the figures in the story supposed to have daily

1105
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:19,135
Daily Caller

1106
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:21,183
And this is this this act

1107
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:23,999
Doesn't go well question earlier about

1108
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:25,023
Doctor in

1109
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:26,559
In Florida

1110
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:27,583
Didn't remember his name

1111
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:30,143
Daily Caller

1112
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:30,911
Reporter

1113
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:31,679
Chuck Rossi

1114
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:34,239
Road about

1115
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:39,103
The doctor's name

1116
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:41,663
Do you know what doctor May

1117
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:42,943
I do not forgive her.

1118
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:45,759
I cannot read the story when it was written

1119
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:49,343
The lawyer and there's also somebody

1120
01:02:58,047 --> 01:02:58,559
I do not

1121
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:01,887
Now the lawyer

1122
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:02,911
Who represented

1123
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:07,263
You know him

1124
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:11,359
Concert

1125
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:13,663
Do I

1126
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:15,199
Okay well I don't

1127
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:16,223
No Tommy sickler

1128
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:16,991
So

1129
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:18,783
Commando a lot of lawyers

1130
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:20,831
You name a world tell you whether I

1131
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:22,111
Right now anyway I'll go back in

1132
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:27,743
But that's fine I don't know,

1133
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:29,791
ER where the lawyer

1134
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:31,071
Wasn't contact

1135
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:31,839
Back with me

1136
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:34,143
Regardless

1137
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:37,983
Who's lawyer

1138
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:41,567
Oh and I'll raise it we all know I am not

1139
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:44,895
You are aware that he can

1140
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:45,663
Claimed to be your

1141
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:56,415
There is unprepared and then there's this

1142
01:03:56,671 --> 01:04:02,815
How do you not know the name of the lawyer asking Rodger question about when the question seems to hinge on whether or not Rodger knows said

1143
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:07,935
How could you possibly expect Rodger to answer a question about an unspecified person

1144
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:11,519
Question blue my mind

1145
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:14,591
He's the guy from that thing you do that guy

1146
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:20,991
I don't know that that I might know the guy

1147
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:23,551
Why did the stuff when there was a dolphin I bleed

1148
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:25,343
Something

1149
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:27,903
If I were Rodger in there

1150
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:30,463
Feel like I was having a stroke like

1151
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:31,743
Why do you ask

1152
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:33,279
Excuse me sir do I smell toast

1153
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:36,863
What is happening

1154
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:42,751
Just give me your name

1155
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:52,479
Justin Bieber

1156
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:55,551
Rodger on March 3rd

1157
01:04:56,063 --> 01:05:02,207
2019 you said I had the balls of a castrated dog now am I holding a castrated. Eyeballs recently prepared

1158
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:08,863
The story behind this is that Chuck Ross a writer for the Daily Caller post

1159
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:13,727
Article that raised some questions about a GoFundMe campaign the course he'd been supporting

1160
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:16,799
For a guy named Tommy sickler who allegedly had cancer

1161
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:23,199
Sigler was apparently in need of an experimental cancer surgery that was to be performed by a dr. Elliot mendelsohn

1162
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:28,831
Course he claimed that Mendelson had quote cured his relatives stage 4 liver cancer

1163
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:33,439
And the Tommy could be saved with this operation as well but he needed the money to make it happen

1164
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:39,839
Apparently that GoFundMe raised over $25,000 but there were some issues that came up when

1165
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:41,375
You got looked into a little bit

1166
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:48,031
According to the Daily Caller that did some digging and found that the link that was provided by Corso you to dr. Mendelson Clinic

1167
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:51,359
Directing people to the website of Mendelson Consulting Group

1168
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:54,943
The registered owner of which was mysteriously Tommy sickler

1169
01:05:56,479 --> 01:06:02,623
That is certainly a pretty big red flag and the guy who needed money for this miracle surgery happens to also be the

1170
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:04,415
The owner of the miracle surgeons business

1171
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:09,535
It seems like he would have been maybe he could even get it at cost

1172
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:16,447
That is all the appearances of a con and it be pretty easy to assume that maybe course he's good-natured got caught up in trying to help a guy

1173
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:23,615
However according to the Daily Caller they were also unable to find any evidence the doctor Mendelssohn even exist

1174
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:24,383
An issue there

1175
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:28,479
The store Cassie Medical Center in Tel Aviv where he said to a practice

1176
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:30,783
No One by that name works at the

1177
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:32,575
Facility and that they had no records

1178
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:39,487
It was alleged that Mendelson also had a practice in Boca Raton Florida but there was no one by that name in the Florida

1179
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:41,279
Physician licensing database

1180
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:45,631
This is a big problem because course had claimed that his relative apparently his

1181
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:46,399
Wife

1182
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:52,799
Cousin had been successfully treated by dr. Mendelson

1183
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:56,127
Well she didn't actually have stage 4 cancer though

1184
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:57,151
So it's fine

1185
01:06:57,407 --> 01:07:00,991
Because an imaginary dropped doctor can absolutely treated imaginary disease

1186
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:04,063
In fact maybe that's the only type of doctor that could do any good

1187
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:07,647
So this is the story as it's laid out in the Daily Caller article

1188
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:10,207
And I don't have no idea what's going on

1189
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:13,535
And Coursey is claim that he didn't make any money off the GoFundMe

1190
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:20,191
All I know is what came out in those stories and you can make up your own conclusions about whatever level of Griff you think is being

1191
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:20,959
Run here

1192
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:22,751
Whether or not course he knew what he was doing

1193
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:29,663
Previously when course he was suing Mueller this story in the Daily Caller was used as proof of Mueller leaking things to the

1194
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:30,943
Press to attack course

1195
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:37,087
This is something that had to have come out of the closed-door interviews with corsi

1196
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:43,743
Now that they're suing Rodger the claim is that Rodger used his connections at the Daily Caller and its friendship with Tucker Carlson to play

1197
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:45,279
Plant the story to attack course

1198
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:46,815
And here's the thing

1199
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:50,143
A move like that wouldn't surprise me one bit from Rodger

1200
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:53,983
The claim it is just saying that it's the case and there's no evidence at all

1201
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:54,751
It seems like

1202
01:07:55,007 --> 01:08:01,151
You know we've already talked about this business strategy just to make accusations and hope Rodger Wilco

1203
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:05,503
It's like asking a bunch of like frivolous it did you go to the store earlier

1204
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:08,831
I did you go see a movie last weekend

1205
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:10,623
Did you kill him

1206
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:14,463
You almost got me there I got to say noticed

1207
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:17,279
So it comes up in this

1208
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:19,071
In this deposition that Rodger was fired

1209
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:23,167
Buy Infowars and we know that from

1210
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:24,447
I made this

1211
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:26,239
Oh I know I know

1212
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:28,543
And so

1213
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:34,431
Where he's assertion is that he got fired because he started talking

1214
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:36,479
You s*** about Corsicana mono

1215
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:41,599
Why were you fired lion

1216
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:44,927
There's no way I could continue to speak

1217
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:48,255
I had wished entirely consumed with my defense

1218
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:51,327
But you have been on television

1219
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:52,351
TuneIn Radio an issue

1220
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:53,119
Other than with

1221
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:55,167
Very occasionally

1222
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:58,495
A lot of other things other than the occasional

1223
01:08:59,263 --> 01:08:59,775
There was

1224
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:02,079
Not a chance that I was going

1225
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:03,871
Continue wedding for Worse

1226
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:05,151
Cuz there wouldn't be enough

1227
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:05,919
Material

1228
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:07,199
You were fired for

1229
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:07,967
Remember words

1230
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:08,735
Because of

1231
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:10,783
She said on it from work

1232
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:11,807
Turning doctor

1233
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:13,343
No that's

1234
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:14,367
Categorically

1235
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:16,671
Expose them to adjust

1236
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:19,743
Got to go.

1237
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:22,815
It disturbs me is just saying things

1238
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:23,839
Yeah

1239
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:24,607
Weird

1240
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:26,143
That's not good now

1241
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:27,423
So anyway

1242
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:28,703
Next clip

1243
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:31,263
Larry accuses Rogers sending Goons

1244
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:36,127
To coursey's house shocking revelation

1245
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:37,151
About Rodger

1246
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:37,919
From 2000

1247
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:43,039
The problem with all of these has that yes Rodger totally could have and

1248
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:45,599
Probably has done that in the past

1249
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:49,951
But you have to have something to back it up you need that

1250
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:56,351
Of course he did s*** like this house

1251
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:57,375
Oh no bottom

1252
01:09:57,631 --> 01:10:00,447
Have the proud boys whenever I don't know

1253
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:01,727
Could you ever send

1254
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:07,615
Categorically positively

1255
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:11,967
Good Samaritan

1256
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:12,735
To the contrary

1257
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:13,759
Resent it

1258
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:20,671
Movie.

1259
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:21,439
When I was

1260
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:22,719
When you representing the in the

1261
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:28,095
I told you about some

1262
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:30,399
Would fit in them

1263
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:32,703
I don't recall

1264
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:35,519
And you told me I got people that can't

1265
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:38,847
I have no memory of

1266
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:40,383
That one it's like I said I don't do this

1267
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:41,663
How do we know that

1268
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:44,223
I'm asking you

1269
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:50,111
And I told you not to do that that's

1270
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:51,135
Completely false

1271
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:52,927
What what things are you talkin to

1272
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:02,399
You have an early evidence that I sent people to Jerry corsi's home

1273
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:04,447
Presented let's see it where is it

1274
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:06,495
Categorically false

1275
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:13,407
So I guess he's saying that he was going to hit people who wouldn't murder Tom fitton back in 2000

1276
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:16,479
Or at least I guess intimidate him or beat him up or something

1277
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:18,015
But that seems to be what he is

1278
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:22,879
Dancing around applying here

1279
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:26,463
Is it true why didn't you say something sooner OU Noah

1280
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:32,095
I don't know

1281
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:38,495
This is it just seems like this is terrible this is such an exercise in Rogers saying and every pot

1282
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:39,263
Possible way

1283
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:40,543
You

1284
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:41,311
Don't

1285
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:42,079
Matter to me

1286
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:45,919
I don't care you know why I don't remember you

1287
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:47,967
Cuz you suck and you're beneath me

1288
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:51,039
You mean nothing I would have left

1289
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:53,855
Already but this is kind of amused

1290
01:11:54,367 --> 01:12:00,255
Insulting you so I'm going to enjoy what time I got

1291
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:02,303
It does feel that way

1292
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:05,631
This next clip put your mic down for this just because

1293
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:10,239
I think that this kind of gets to one of the larger issues of the

1294
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:13,311
What what claim is put in fortnite is it like

1295
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:14,591
In order to really

1296
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:15,359
Have

1297
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:17,151
Like a financial claim

1298
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:20,479
You have to show how Rogers actions

1299
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:23,295
Negatively affected

1300
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:24,831
Larry tries to

1301
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:28,927
Make that point here but how this clip ends is like

1302
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:30,719
It's awesome it's

1303
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:33,535
Rogers lawyer finally being like

1304
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:34,303
Come on

1305
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:36,863
So to say that we are working with

1306
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:38,143
Robert Mueller is

1307
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:39,679
To say that we're Genesis

1308
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:41,471
I didn't say that

1309
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:42,239
What about you

1310
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:45,823
Barbara Jordan

1311
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:49,407
I'm not responsible for the statements of Deborah Jordan

1312
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:51,199
I never told her to say or not

1313
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:51,967
Not say any

1314
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:54,015
That you're aware that I should mow around

1315
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:56,063
I did

1316
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:57,087
What happened you lost

1317
01:12:58,111 --> 01:12:58,879
Going through the courts

1318
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:00,415
Read about it

1319
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:02,719
You're aware that

1320
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:04,767
On behalf of course he think that's funny

1321
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:09,887
Michelle least I did something for my client sitting here you know during the trial and it getting them Invicta

1322
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:13,727
Your next question is your lawsuit was dismissed

1323
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:14,751
Go ahead

1324
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:25,247
You just couldn't resist bringing that guy into bringing the lawyer in NYU laughing

1325
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:31,647
Watching two little boy fight without trying to get Dad involved in there in a little bit

1326
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:38,047
DoubleDown

1327
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:39,071
Are we doing

1328
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:41,375
These are grown man

1329
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:42,143
It is

1330
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:42,911
Weird

1331
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:47,263
This is Jordan person is another

1332
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:48,287
Barbara Jordan

1333
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:49,567
She's another alleged

1334
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:54,175
Person that that claim it is saying that Rodger uses an intermediary

1335
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:56,991
To push these negative stories to defame

1336
01:13:57,247 --> 01:13:59,039
Corsi and himself

1337
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:02,111
With it we again just with the implications because there's evidence

1338
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:04,671
And that you know whatever that's different story

1339
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:07,743
But I don't see any of it presented here at all

1340
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:11,327
Answer there's another journalist that

1341
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:13,119
Larry thinks

1342
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:17,983
That Rodger is using as a fence any plans to depose them

1343
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:19,263
And Rogers AR

1344
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:21,055
Good luck deatherage journalism

1345
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:22,847
What do you

1346
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:24,127
What do you think you're doing

1347
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:26,431
He defamed coercing me

1348
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:29,247
That's your version

1349
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:31,807
What will find

1350
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:33,855
Good luck

1351
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:35,647
Why did luck

1352
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:39,231
You wanted to pose a journalist about their source

1353
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:39,999
Good luck

1354
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:42,047
Were you sore

1355
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:45,119
No but I see you want to ask

1356
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:47,423
You can ask her but she's not

1357
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:49,215
She does not have to answer any

1358
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:50,239
Regarding

1359
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:56,127
What you're saying is you were a source to the media.

1360
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:58,175
Boss categorically false

1361
01:14:58,431 --> 01:14:58,943
You are now

1362
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:01,503
Billiards

1363
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:05,599
Continue

1364
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:12,511
Is how human would respond

1365
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:20,447
That is so funny so in addition to the planting stories accusation there's also

1366
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:22,239
Accusation that Rodger

1367
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:26,591
I pulled strings at Newsmax today Larry klayman off

1368
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:29,407
Being able to speak on newsman

1369
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:35,551
Okay and I think that it sounds a little conspiratorial the way that claiming is

1370
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:37,087
Is pitching the story

1371
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:40,671
And then it deteriorates this again complete derailment

1372
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:42,463
Return to the email

1373
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:43,743
Dated

June 1st 2019

6:15

1376
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:49,375
28

1377
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:50,655
To Christopher Ruddy

1378
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:53,983
Claim into PDF

1379
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:54,751
From Rogers

1380
01:15:55,519 --> 01:15:56,031
Correct

1381
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:58,847
Where you write to Ruddy claiming assuming Maybe

1382
01:15:59,103 --> 01:15:59,871
Because he alleges I've been

1383
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:00,639
Interfered with his

1384
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:03,967
I don't recall have

1385
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:04,735
Have you ever

1386
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:06,527
Discussing this a******

1387
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:08,063
With you or Clemente

1388
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:09,855
Clearly

1389
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:13,183
Now

1390
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:15,231
Who's Clemente

1391
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:17,023
Dementia is

1392
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:19,583
Well he's there anymore but he was there Direct

1393
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:20,351
Program

1394
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:24,447
He work for Fox News

1395
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:25,983
I believe that's correct

1396
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:28,543
I know you don't have any medical background

1397
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:31,615
12.1 mix

1398
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:33,663
Allegations

1399
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:35,199
That I had interfere with

1400
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:36,735
With your being interview with Newsmax

1401
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:38,015
On the basis of no evidence

1402
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:39,039
However

1403
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:41,087
Having never discussed it with Roddy

1404
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:42,367
Or cardillo

1405
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:45,183
Or Clemente the only people I knew in his

1406
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:48,511
Yeah it's pretty crazy

1407
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:52,607
So you crazy

1408
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:55,167
You made a allegation

1409
01:16:55,423 --> 01:16:55,935
Time Medico

1410
01:16:56,959 --> 01:17:00,287
Insane as I think a colloquial expression but when someone

1411
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:04,639
Pulls facts out of the year for which they have no evidence whatsoever

1412
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:05,407
Guessing

1413
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:07,967
Because you're unhappy that they can't be interviewed when

1414
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:09,759
Yeah I think that's pretty

1415
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:13,087
Bring me that since a Newsmax bring it on someone

1416
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:14,367
Fairbanks

1417
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:21,791
Call Mike like or cir over and over I have you would have to do would have to ask cuz if he

1418
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:22,559
People Newsmax

1419
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:23,583
That I didn't make any

1420
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:25,631
Recommendation or decision to admit

1421
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:26,911
Fairbanks on the air

1422
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:28,959
I have no impact on Hulu Newsmax

1423
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:31,007
Chooses or does not choose

1424
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:33,567
Cardillo sending out tweets

1425
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:40,479
Support of you and

1426
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:42,783
Dubai buddy but I don't tell him what

1427
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:43,551
Tweet

1428
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:45,343
I don't tell him who to interview

1429
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:47,903
He has First Amendment rights like everyone else

1430
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:49,695
2 + 2 equal

1431
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:50,463
Doesn't it

1432
01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:57,119
And you have nothing

1433
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:57,887
Larry evidence

1434
01:17:58,143 --> 01:18:01,727
Evidence not guessing on your part was nothing nothing

1435
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:05,823
You're nothing

1436
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:10,687
Real quick you can hear it very lightly Rodger said

1437
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:19,135
Do you know that's where if I was Rodger still in Florida be like

1438
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:25,535
What your clients argue that this will be over

1439
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:31,423
If you want to keep insulting maybe I will just end this new running back the judge

1440
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:34,495
Did you call me a b**** that you're acting like one

1441
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:38,079
Acting like what

1442
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:39,359
A wild guess

1443
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:42,431
If you have some evidence that I communicated with Rowdy

1444
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:44,991
Or cardillo or Clemente or

1445
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:47,807
Producer

1446
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:54,463
Anything by interviewing

1447
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:58,303
Nothing

1448
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:00,351
Ask a question

1449
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:09,567
I do like I do like are you medically professional enough to tell somebody that

1450
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:12,127
I'm not saying you're insane you're f****** crazy

1451
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:17,759
Make an assessment I'm speaking in the vernacular the colloquial

1452
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:25,695
So you know hey I'm not thrilled with you know people just got here acting like a b**** I think that's

1453
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:32,095
That's cool do you know that's a little Antiquated a little inappropriate certainly but Rodger is not a great guy

1454
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:37,983
I don't expect him to have that kind of

1455
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:39,263
Position on it

1456
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:42,847
I would say that Larry's is weirder

1457
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:49,247
His position on having that said to him cuz they take a little break and they come back and

1458
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:50,015
This is just

1459
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:51,551
Weird

1460
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:53,855
Mr Stoner in a few minutes ago you called me

1461
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:54,623
A b****

1462
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:55,647
How should you acting

1463
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:56,415
What is

1464
01:19:57,695 --> 01:19:58,975
But what's the point of that

1465
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:03,071
I'm not going to answer the question tomorrow

1466
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:05,375
Come on ass cuz he requested Layman tarrasque

1467
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:06,655
Let's let's

1468
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:10,495
If you use it there make attacks on me and when I respond you don't like

1469
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:17,152
But what is entitled to know what you meant by that.

1470
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:18,944
Is that someone who's gay

1471
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:25,344
Stop no it's not it's not is not a slur of any kind barraging

1472
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,624
Please knock

1473
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:33,280
Mister claiming lawyer search

1474
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:38,144
Is that really what you think it means come on go ask your next question

1475
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,424
I'm asking him what he

1476
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:42,240
Answer the question

1477
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:43,776
Regarding my

1478
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:45,568
Elementary

1479
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:46,848
That's

1480
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:47,616
Just

1481
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:51,200
Your old lawyer good God that is that is funny

1482
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:57,344
What's that pressure release a 27-point of like when is somebody going to say

1483
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:02,720
So earlier we heard

1484
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:06,048
Larry put forth this idea that

1485
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:12,704
Rodger was trying to plant these stories of Coursey and Clayman working with Mueller because they

1486
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:15,264
They make her money off conservative circles

1487
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:20,128
And that put that portrays them as the Judas Iscariot riding that cripples their livelihood

1488
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:21,408
Kauai

1489
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:22,176
Kinda thing

1490
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:26,528
That Larry is trying to do the same thing to Rodger in this deposition

1491
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:27,808
You're worth it the judge

1492
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:30,624
It's at on the climbing Monday process

1493
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:31,392
Confusion was

1494
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:32,416
1 Gloria

1495
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:35,232
Yes I wasn't yours I was not a fan of her

1496
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:37,024
You're aware that she was recommended

1497
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:38,304
Barack Obama

1498
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:39,584
Re-read

1499
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:40,608
I didn't know that

1500
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:42,656
Specifically but I knew she was endemic

1501
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:43,936
I don't have a very high regard

1502
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:46,752
Nor do I have a high regard for

1503
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:48,288
The Georgian the way

1504
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:52,384
Your weather

1505
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:55,200
But I don't know why

1506
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:56,480
You're aware that

1507
01:21:58,784 --> 01:22:00,064
Yes I did

1508
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:00,832
You're aware that

1509
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:01,600
She's romances

1510
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:03,648
Yes that's why I want

1511
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:04,672
The president Department

1512
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:06,208
You're aware that for two and a half

1513
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:06,976
Years

1514
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:09,280
They were Carson

1515
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:12,352
Yesterday was outrageous

1516
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:13,376
That's why I wanted the president

1517
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:14,400
Believe them

1518
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:17,216
Did you find it

1519
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:20,288
Inappropriately

1520
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:24,128
Never take any

1521
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:28,736
That's an outrage

1522
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:30,016
Not going to discuss

1523
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:36,416
That feels like an attempt by Larry to paint Rodger is being not committed to the right-wing cause

1524
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:39,488
He would take apart and personally from Trump for himself

1525
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:42,304
Outraged the Trump wouldn't pardon the Bundy

1526
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:47,168
The first problem here is that there's no evidence that Rodger wasn't mad about the Bundy situation

1527
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:48,704
IPic

1528
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:51,264
I would assume everything I heard it.

1529
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:56,640
The second problem is that in July 2018 Trump did pardoned Dwight and Steven Hammond

1530
01:22:57,408 --> 01:23:00,992
Ammon and Cliven Bundy their cases ended in a mistrial

1531
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:02,272
Even in jail

1532
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:04,576
The people surrounding this you know

1533
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:08,160
First Bundy's the Bunkerville and then the

1534
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:09,952
Malheur wildlife

1535
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:11,232
Those standoffs like

1536
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:15,840
They're not in prison yeah that's that's Larry's talk

1537
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:16,608
About II

1538
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:18,912
Yeah sure

1539
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:25,312
Northern Larry normally I wouldn't think too much about something like this and I would just ignore it but so much of Larry's argument about Stone

1540
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:28,896
Seems to be about how Rodger was trying to use Outlets like Infowars a Newsmax

1541
01:23:29,408 --> 01:23:32,992
Just me or him and corsi because they make their living office conservative Market

1542
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:34,528
And making them talks

1543
01:23:34,784 --> 01:23:35,552
Stick to those Outlets

1544
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:36,576
It would hurt their reach

1545
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:41,440
It seems to me mostly because what Rodger Saint Larry's Saint doesn't make much sense

1546
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:44,256
But this line of questioning feels like I'm trying to do that

1547
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:45,280
Same thing to Rodger

1548
01:23:45,536 --> 01:23:46,816
Phantom is a turncoat to

1549
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:50,144
The Bundys noted Heroes of The Fringe conservative world

1550
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:56,800
This deposition is so far off the rails throughout that I don't really feel like it's too weird to suggest that might be the motive for that

1551
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:59,360
A question totally plausible

1552
01:23:59,616 --> 01:24:01,664
The only other motive I can think of is

1553
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:03,200
It's just to try and

1554
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:06,528
Win an argument with Rodger Stone because he's under oath

1555
01:24:06,784 --> 01:24:08,576
And it's not going well for Larry

1556
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:10,112
So

1557
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,416
We have a couple more clips left

1558
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:14,720
This one is pretty funny

1559
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:17,280
Larry

1560
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:19,328
Ask Rodger about little

1561
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:22,656
Little news item that came out back when he was running for Senate

1562
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:23,936
You remember when

1563
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:25,216
You were

1564
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:27,008
As you put it

1565
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:29,568
Consultant

1566
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:32,896
Vaguely was quite a while ago

1567
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:35,200
You remember that

1568
01:24:35,712 --> 01:24:36,736
There came a point time

1569
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:38,272
When

1570
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:39,296
I was going to the airport

1571
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:40,064
Dulles

1572
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:42,624
Cats yes I do and

1573
01:24:43,136 --> 01:24:43,648
That I was.

1574
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:44,416
Detained

1575
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:48,512
I believe I recall that you were detained because you made some joke about the

1576
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:49,280
The cat

1577
01:24:49,536 --> 01:24:50,304
Not having a ball

1578
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:52,096
You were my Kim

1579
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:52,864
Champagne

1580
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:54,144
Consultant

1581
01:24:54,912 --> 01:24:55,424
Yes

1582
01:24:56,192 --> 01:24:56,704
And

1583
01:24:57,216 --> 01:24:58,496
You release that story did you

1584
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:00,288
Jim defede

1585
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:01,312
TGIF

1586
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:02,080
City of the Maya

1587
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:03,360
Harold after we stopped

1588
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:05,664
I most certainly did not

1589
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:07,200
Then Michael Caputo

1590
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:09,760
I have no knowledge of that whatsoever

1591
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:12,320
And you have no evidence either more of your

1592
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:13,856
Taking things out of thin air

1593
01:25:14,112 --> 01:25:18,208
You really I would anybody make a statement a joke about a bomb while going through TSA

1594
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:19,488
Chose me

1595
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:20,256
Judgment

1596
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:22,048
Questioning

1597
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:22,816
For the u.s.

1598
01:25:23,584 --> 01:25:27,680
You haven't shown a lack of judgment with regard to you

1599
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:31,776
At what point is Rodger just going to be like

1600
01:25:32,032 --> 01:25:36,384
Do you want your f****** computers back what do you want what are you f****** want

1601
01:25:37,152 --> 01:25:39,200
Pizza yeah

1602
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:43,808
Can't believe you would bring that up

1603
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:50,464
Image of a ago I made a joke about my cat not having a bomb when I go through the TSA

1604
01:25:50,976 --> 01:25:57,120
It's story you leak into the brass 60 minutes ago. I didn't well then your friend Michael Caputo

1605
01:25:57,888 --> 01:26:00,448
Do you have any proof of anything

1606
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:01,728
Supposed to

1607
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:06,592
It is very stupid man holding a grudge 4:30

1608
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:09,408
Larry wants to go back over a lot of

1609
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:15,808
Stop Future these things in the affidavit and Rogers

1610
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:17,600
Is not having any of it

1611
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:18,880
Is how things end

1612
01:26:19,136 --> 01:26:19,904
We have time

1613
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:22,976
The review

1614
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:28,096
Biography biography and all of your asinine claims

1615
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:29,632
Because you're an egomaniac

1616
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:30,656
I'm just not going to do

1617
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:38,336
If you have a specific question

1618
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:39,360
Well-known

1619
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:41,152
Well now

1620
01:26:44,224 --> 01:26:49,856
I'm asking you you can take your time go to a paragraph by crap I already

1621
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:51,392
We went we went through this yes

1622
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:55,232
Wait until I didn't ask it that way

1623
01:26:59,072 --> 01:27:00,096
Yes please do

1624
01:27:00,352 --> 01:27:00,864
Alex

1625
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:01,888
The judge myself about

1626
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:03,936
How to do a quick

1627
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:06,240
Before you're just hard.

1628
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:08,544
Stop mr. clean

1629
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:10,592
You tell that to 7

1630
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:15,712
No further questions as I can end this

1631
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:16,992
So much

1632
01:27:17,248 --> 01:27:17,760
So much

1633
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:18,784
Teddy like

1634
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:23,648
Oh we'll see in court I'll talk to the judge myself

1635
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:25,440
To the judge

1636
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:29,792
Group most of this like defamation

1637
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:35,424
A lot of it like some of it is stuff that Rodger said on Infowars or on social media

1638
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:37,216
And then a good bit of it

1639
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:41,568
Is things that are being presented as things that Rodger fed

1640
01:27:41,824 --> 01:27:44,384
Do the meteorite the stuff that Rodger said

1641
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:45,664
Is stuff like

1642
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:51,552
Things that are very easily just like I was my opinion this is protected speech.

1643
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:56,160
Here's what I'm doing I'm saying you suck in different more colorful way

1644
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:58,208
If you just want me to say you suck

1645
01:27:58,464 --> 01:28:01,024
Then boil it down to you suck

1646
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:05,632
So there's another lawyer there who asked Rodger some question

1647
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:08,704
Right here

1648
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:12,544
Sure okay after clayman's done he comes in and asks

1649
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:15,872
Rodger about these other instances

1650
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:17,408
Cassandra Fairbanks story

1651
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:18,176
Newsmax

1652
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:21,760
All that and look how easily this is this is handled

1653
01:28:25,856 --> 01:28:27,648
Are you wearing in the complaint

1654
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:28,672
Corsi

1655

Stone

1656
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:30,976
Cordello's

1657
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:33,280
Baldin

1658
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:34,560
Are there allegations

1659
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:35,328
Regarding

1660
01:28:35,584 --> 01:28:36,352
Cassandra Fairbanks

1661
01:28:36,608 --> 01:28:37,120
Appearance on

1662
01:28:39,424 --> 01:28:39,936
2019

1663
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:41,216
Are you aware that

1664
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:43,520
Were you aware

1665
01:28:44,032 --> 01:28:45,568

Going to appear on

1669
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:56,576
Did you discuss the possible appearance of Cassandra Fairbanks on Newsmax with anybody at Newsmax

1670
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:58,368
I get around that time I did not

1671
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:00,160
Crystal ready

1672
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:02,208
Did not John Bachman

1673
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:03,232
Cardillo

1674
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:06,560
Did you discuss with anybody Newsmax

1675
01:29:07,072 --> 01:29:10,656
Better about that time presenting anything negative about Jerome corsi

1676
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:11,424
I did not

1677
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:13,472
Did you encourage anyone to do Smacks

1678
01:29:13,728 --> 01:29:15,776
Jerome corsi in a negative light

1679
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:18,336
Did you ask anybody else

1680
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:19,872
To contact Newsmax

1681
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:20,640
On your behalf

1682
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:22,176
To encourage them to

1683
01:29:23,968 --> 01:29:24,480
I did not

1684
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:30,624
Let the record reflect that this Witness

1685
01:29:37,792 --> 01:29:43,936
This is a bar is a bar license is under attack in New York for his cereal

1686
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:48,800
Very professional

1687
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:57,504
Got to get it in there I think all that he was

1688
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:58,784
Aiming to achieve

1689
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:00,576
Would have been achieved in a minute

1690
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:06,976
Other lawyers that deposition should have lasted at most 10 minutes

1691
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:13,376
Those questions are being asked to Rodger which he's answering directly if you have evidence that he's lying

1692
01:30:13,632 --> 01:30:19,776
Got him in a lie there you can present your evidence I do have proof that you did speak

1693
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:21,056
I told her to write this article

1694
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:27,456
You want me to bring up her potential nude pictures of actress sleeping with Julian Assange gives a s*** here we have an email

1695
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:33,088
Hellsing that you talked to a Cassandra favorite do you remember sending this email that's a good follow-up question

1696
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:34,368
Not a good follow-up question

1697
01:30:34,624 --> 01:30:40,768
Did you know that Cassandra Banks has nudity photos on the internet in this deposition you do not need to workout

1698
01:30:41,024 --> 01:30:45,888
Motive you hated me because of the 2004

1699
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:46,912
Run

1700
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:52,800
How does it

1701
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:55,872
6 hours when a good lawyer is like

1702
01:30:56,128 --> 01:30:58,176
What we got nothing in about 5 minutes

1703
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:02,528
That's one minute

1704
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:03,808
Insane

1705
01:31:04,064 --> 01:31:07,648
Part of it is because Rodger likes to fight

1706
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:09,696
What kind of

1707
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:12,512
What kind of bulshit law did he learn that

1708
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:18,400
Jets on TV log that's what that's what somebody says when they're like let the record show this Tuesday

1709
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:23,264
The Sovereign citizen type of likes let the record show that he's convicted of

1710
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:29,664
Everybody already knows band record does show whatever he's been convicted of

1711
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:32,480
40 * Atwood did we just start recording

1712
01:31:32,736 --> 01:31:33,248
Man

1713
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:39,392
I don't know it's it's interesting to me on this occasion of Rodger you know being sentence

1714
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:45,792
Yeah it is nice to let you know that he had a last hurrah

1715
01:31:46,048 --> 01:31:52,192
Direct one more time before this.

1716
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:54,240
Is 8

1717
01:31:54,752 --> 01:32:00,896
I think Rodger and employment are both bad like they're both bad actors

1718
01:32:01,152 --> 01:32:05,248
We care to scale them or anything really does demonstrate like the difference

1719
01:32:05,504 --> 01:32:10,368
Between having it and not like has it

1720
01:32:10,624 --> 01:32:12,416
Through this whole deposition it's like

1721
01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:14,464
This is how he gets

1722
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:20,864
So many people everybody knows he's going to stab you in the back but it was charismatic and he's funny at

1723
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:24,192
He can throw some zingers out and if you feel like he's on your

1724
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:24,960
Team you're like

1725
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:28,544
Yeah we can take down anybody and then you get stabbed in the back

1726
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:32,896
Like that's the siren song of his like Rapier wit and

1727
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:36,224
And it sort of cruelness like a funny meanness yet

1728
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:38,784
Is

1729
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:41,344
You being very easy to get sucked into

1730
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:44,160
Thinking that like this will never go wrong

1731
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:48,768
Evidently mom MyTeam have you seen what good he can do for people on his team

1732
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:49,792
And they just

1733
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:52,096
But I mean it's also because you know

1734
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:54,656
Esdeath

1735
01:32:55,168 --> 01:32:56,960
