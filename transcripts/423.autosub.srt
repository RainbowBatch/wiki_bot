1
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I have great respect for knowledge by knowledge I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

2
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
Need

3
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:56,064
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Alex Jones

5
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:11,936
Indeed we are Jordan Jordan related

6
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:17,568
Somebody's Seltzer's

7
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:23,968
Year the Year of the seltzer

8
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:30,368
Drinking whatever Seltzer's I could find

9
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:36,768
Turbo heater on Twitter

10
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,144
Pictures of all the shelters were drink

11
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,936
Getting a back-and-forth

12
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:50,336
This quarantine can't hold me back quinine or anything

13
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,784
Every five years of the year of the shelter's like the Chinese New Year the year of the Rat

14
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,600
2020 is going to be the year the seltzer

15
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:05,952
And an opening Salvo of getting bad business on the Seltzer's

16
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:11,072
Got this aha aha Cola product

17
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:14,656
Maybe a little bit disappointed

18
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:20,032
The got the flavor that seemed the most

19
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:22,336
Interesting and the most dangerous

20
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,384
It is a cheer

21
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,152
Coffee

22
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,688
Seltzer

23
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:31,552
We were talking about this before I was scared to try it

24
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,856
I did not know what it was going to be like

25
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,624
Advantage

26
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,256
It really is I'm drinking one as we speak of already almost finished it in the past 10 minutes

27
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:46,400
Is the coffee flavor isn't really coughing exact comes off like a chocolate and chocolate-covered cherry

28
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,192
But not overly sweet

29
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:54,592
It's very Define Seltzer and I'm not disappointed to have a couple more of them left in the fridge

30
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:58,688
Reasons a bright spot is because we're starting out the Earth itself the real straps

31
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,736
Second verse good Seltzer the year

32
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,272
Second you got to take

33
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,808
These bright spots

34
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,344
Who's kind of July

35
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:11,744
And celebrate little things that are almost meaningless that are still there still really nice

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,144
And like you know you can buy a flavor like Cherry coffee and you like I don't f****** know how this is going to go

37
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,216
Well we've got to take a moment and say thank you universe

38
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:27,616
You have kept me on a good hat

39
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:31,712
Like the only the only argument I could come up with is

40
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:35,040
This sounds so crazy the only reason it could

41
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,064
Possibly exist

42
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,600
Is because it has to be good

43
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:41,952
No way that anybody would be like will it put coffee in black cherry Marriott

44
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:45,024
Like s*** and then put it in the store

45
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,376
It's not like some weirdo makes these it's a company

46
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:55,776
They have to have a border around a good idea

47
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,360
But I've also been burned some of those other

48
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,128
1

49
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,688
I don't know if I should put them on blast

50
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:09,088
Spindrift

51
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:18,047
Over the weekend was Corona relief

52
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:24,703
They had the Summer Games Done Quick lineups all set up and they couldn't do it obviously

53
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:28,031
Speedrun

54
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:32,639
Fundraiser that they hastily assembled and they wound up raising

55
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:36,479
On a last-minute thing and it just makes me feel really good that

56
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,503
People can just

57
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:41,087
F****** decide as a community be like let's f****** do they

58
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:44,159
That is very nice together in less than a few weeks

59
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,951
Have it go off pretty well

60
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:53,375
Shut up Jones Hill game dorks

61
00:04:53,887 --> 00:05:00,031
Never heard of it it's like a it's like Dance Dance Revolution PaRappa the Rapper

62
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,335
That kind of thing and he played it

63
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:06,175
Our street and is the most complicated thing that I've ever use

64
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,479
An incredible tap dancer

65
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,807
I remember PaRappa the Rapper

66
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:14,111
Ubiquitous

67
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,583
April 20th

68
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:29,983

69
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,031

Heroin

86
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:51,647

88
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:02,399

Or please feel free to drink that will help

90
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,455
People who are directly affected

91
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:19,807
In the worst ways by the troubles

92
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,927
So Jordan it's April 20th it's 4:20

93
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,719
Alex's show

94
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,767
So I figured

95
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,535
Start off

96
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,327
With some chill music getting

97
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:35,423
Lalaloopsy

98
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:42,847
Alright

99
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:49,759
Okay we're doing this

100
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,159
I did that

101
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,975
I don't think the 311 is reggae

102
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:03,839
Stop it just ridiculous make Alex the least chill out of the world

103
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:09,215
People who smoke a lot of weed often like 311 and it makes Alex

104
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:15,871
Loses

105
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,663
Get time to Natural clips

106
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,711
Today's episode here's an out-of-context drop

107
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,271
Haircut

108
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,063
Saturday on the black market

109
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,439
Did the black market haircut man

110
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,975
That's wild

111
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:38,143
What's fun about that

112
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:45,055
It's really crazy about this is Alex's buses

113
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:50,175
Save-A-Lot out there like protesting

114
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:53,503
But I get busy like I want to get a haircut they have like really

115
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,343
Complicated

116
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,367
Skip 5 minutes

117
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,207
I'm saying that if someone buzzes his head

118
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:06,303
At this point I would not need anyone to come do it I'll be a waste of money

119
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:10,399
He's a media personality he needs the finest Buzz haircut

120
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,679
There's literally no

121
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:20,127
So Alex starts off the show Reign take a bit about vaccines and apparently turns out that

122
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:20,895
Some vaccine

123
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:27,807
They're not really vaccines parts of your brain

124
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:28,575
Because

125
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,111
The globalist

126
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:34,463
Use these vaccines in order to make sure the people no longer has

127
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:37,023
The parts of their brain that are spiritual

128
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,327
The part of the brain cease vaccines attack

129
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,399
So you get the vaccine you'll no longer be able to connect with God

130
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:46,239
Play the man you worship the world government the mark of the beast

131
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:50,335
They demand that you take vaccines in your body

132
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:53,151
Engineered viruses literally

133
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,455
Parts of your brain

134
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,503
Associated with religious

135
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,551
My brainwave

136
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:05,439
Yes ladies and gentlemen that's what's going to be available in the gates

137
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,463
Vaccine

138
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,487
Okay

139
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,583
This is interesting

140
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,631
Because you know in his

141
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,167
Conception

142
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:18,495
These vaccines are going in in order to disrupt the connection

143
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,287
Between yourself and the divine

144
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,567
Yeah which is weird

145
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:27,711
Spiritual is no longer a kind of nebulous concept there is a

146
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,015
Like the medulla oblongata if you

147
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:36,415
You f*** with that a little bit God can no longer talk to you that is what I would like maybe

148
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:40,767
Electrochemical transmission that is God speaking to you or something

149
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:47,167
It's not actually spiritual it's all very mechanical

150
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:53,567
Like there's a physical explanation for why it's a little weird I'm not into it and I just

151
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,103
Reject

152
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:58,687
Alex has a big narrative today

153
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,223
Takes most of the show

154
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:04,575
And I'll be honest I'm not going to play him repeating it over and over again

155
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:08,671
But it does set him off onto a really f***** up sort of space

156
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:13,535
Complete the very groups that engineered covid-19 and launched

157
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,351
Manitowoc now

158
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:20,447
Prepared

159
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,495
Cyrus is already patented

160
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:26,079
Relations with the vaccine

161
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:29,407
Contracted to use as a digital

162
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:37,343
With all 7 million people

163
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,391
Under the skin

164
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,951
So you're allowed to buy and sell

165
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,999
Same time it is

166
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,143
2020

167
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,167
06

168
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,703
06

169
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,239
06

170
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,591
Make that up

171
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:04,223
Recently

172
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:07,551
As the allegation that Microsoft had applied for a patent

173
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,087
It was essentially the mark of the

174
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,111
Hey why not

175
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:14,719
The real evidence provided for this traced back to a patent on patentscope

176
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:18,047
Number 2020 060606

177
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,839
Or at least it appears to be

178
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:23,935
Cryptocurrency system using body activity data

179
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:26,239
I read over this thing and it seems really f*****

180
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,287
And it's something I totally opposed to

181
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,823
But it doesn't seem like the mark

182
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:36,991
It really seems more like a patent for maybe not even something that's real yet that better technology that would allow bile

183
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:40,063
Metric data to be used in Bitcoin mining computations

184
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:40,831
Which person

185
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,367
Academic be awarded for

186
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:45,439
If they wanted to allow their biometric data to be used for said copy

187
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,207
Mutations

188
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:52,607
So basically like you would have a stimulus from the operation or whatever and then

189
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:59,007
Rising heart rate or whatever would somehow be used in the computation of the Bitcoin mine instead of

190
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,799
Servers that would be using

191
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:05,663
Humans like the Matrix like is as a energy source to farm Bitcoin

192
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:10,783
I don't know about energy source but yeah I mean I'm not into it

193
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,391
I also doesn't seem as like

194
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,439
Sci-fi and f***** up as

195
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,487
The Matrix and also the

196
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:24,351
Cool thing that I was saying

197
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:29,727
But if it were something to do like

198
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,519
Betabeat participate in this

199
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:34,079
I don't really know if I call it wrong or evil

200
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,359
Audi more evidence

201
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:39,711
But this had any kind of applications outside of what it appears to be for me to be too worried about it

202
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:45,343
Or even that they can't do this when you file a patent it doesn't mean that you have the technology mean

203
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:48,159
Down the road we might be able to

204
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,951
However dad there's another issue

205
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,231
And that is that I don't

206
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:54,047
Think that this patent number is what Alex thinks it is

207
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,839
All that traces back

208
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,375
Tube this post on Patton

209
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:59,935
And scope but if you search the u.s. patent office

210
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,727
Your real hard time coming up with

211
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,007
Black patent number

212
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,287
There's a number of problem

213
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,615
The first of the patents are numbered beginning with the year of the patent

214
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,383
So I would start with

215
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,151
2020

216
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,199
However the alleged patent patent

217
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,479
2020

218
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:15,807
060606

219
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,343
That's six digits long

220
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:21,183
Time to begin with 20/20 and then are followed by seven

221
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:26,559
Another gigantic problem is that the number doesn't mix

222
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,375
For context an application for patent

223
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:34,751
Filed on April 16th is number 20 20011 99-82

224
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:38,591
You can tell the nowhere near Patton starting with 06

225
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:43,455
It took me forever to find but he searched the US patent and trademark office you can find the exit

226
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,735
US patent number

227
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,271
Which is 20/20

228
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:49,599
009-7951

229
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:54,207
The number 2020 060606 is not a patent number

230
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:58,047
The publication number provided by the world intellectual property office

231
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,351
Exist in the United States

232
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,399
Cooperation

233
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:08,031
3D people can file their patents with the world intellectual property office The Protector intellectual property

234
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:11,103
In 184 countries that are members of that treaty

235
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:14,687
So I guess the bottom line on this is that I don't care

236
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:21,343
Every year some patent ends up with that number and striving some kind of significance to it seems pretty arbitrary

237
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:26,463
Every year some patent does number 420 69 or 911

238
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,231
It doesn't mean anything

239
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:33,887
Also this is not the patent number and even if it were a person applying for a patent doesn't control the number another application

240
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:40,543
As far as I can tell the defining characteristic of the biblical mark of the beast is that it's something that you need you need to be alive

241
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,823
Allowed to buy and sell things

242
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,639
This patent is not for something that you need to buy yourself

243
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,943
Thanks

244
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:53,087
Add to that the application number games you know this whole thing and I just end up at a position while I feeling is I don't give a s***

245
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:56,159
Important point to consider here

246
00:15:56,671 --> 00:16:02,047
Is Alex's reporting things like the mark of the beast being here and real and this specific thing

247
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:07,167
Can't really be any confusion about how there's not much Road left in front of him

248
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:12,799
Where do you go after you've escalated your rhetoric so extremely that you've reached the last book of the Bible

249
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,335
When your end times

250
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,127
It doesn't happen

251
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,919
How's Alex ever try again

252
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:21,503
Like it's one thing to pretend it is dumb radio show averted a gun grab

253
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,319
It's another to pretend that he held back a literal Armageddon

254
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,623
I think that's one of the essential problem

255
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:29,951
Mixing political conspiracy with religious fanaticism

256
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:34,815
Political conspiracies on endlessly flowing self-perpetuating in never-ending Road

257
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:39,935
There's always another secret player you can pin things onto your existing Theory start to look on satisfying

258
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,215
But there's really

259
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:44,287
Never anything definitive an ultimate about political

260
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,055
Conspiracies

261
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:50,175
Religious fanaticism on the other hand is a car that's driving directly toward a conclusion

262
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,223
It's fine to use religious fanaticism

263
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:56,319
The teaser audience or to augment your narratives a little once it becomes a central

264
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,623
Component as it appears to be right now with Alex

265
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:03,231
It's only a matter of time before you're wrong and at that point it's really hard to explain away your error

266
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:09,887
Liking someone like Harold that guy who's I tried the end on this date you miscalculated

267
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,423
You'll have a

268
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:17,823
Retention problems people's face

269
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,103
This is

270
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:19,871
Anyting

271
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:25,247
He could

272
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,343
Say that God was like

273
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,391
I got you

274
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,183
Maybe

275
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:36,511
Seems like a bad narrative to me even from Alex's perspective

276
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,047
It seems alright

277
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:40,095
I'm kind of

278
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:46,751
I can understand if things don't work out you can let a little trivial xenophobia base narrative drop

279
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,799
This is the mark of the beast

280
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,847
You can't move on from that like

281
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,919
This piece of the Book of Revelation being fulfilled

282
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,991
Because it demands continued coverage

283
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,271
The train is on the track

284
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,319
I don't know I think they

285
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:06,719
What where every 5 years we got a new mark of the beast everybody likes Fox News even has a graphic that's like

286
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:09,279
Some people are saying this is the new mark of the beast like

287
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:15,935
I think my I think my Gordon it's one thing to say some people are saying cuz of Artemis.

288
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:20,287
Like sort of almost Local News Human by the way

289
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:22,079
We have definitively proven

290
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:28,223
It is the back of the Beast

291
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:36,415
That will be something better

292
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,439
Escalate to like

293
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:40,511
I am discussing the ultimate fulfillment of

294
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,279
Mi religion

295
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,583
Prophetic vision of the end times

296
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:49,983
And then like we do eventually if you still on the air will do something like that

297
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,007
Sales Market Beast

298
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,567
That's only wanted you to think

299
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,359
They're taking it out of context

300
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,151
I find it

301
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:01,759
I find it kind of weird and maybe sacrilegious that it seems like he's removing space

302
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,551
It's from the entire religious process

303
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:06,367
Like he even liked with the with the brain

304
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,159
Like he's adding midichlorian

305
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,975
Like that's what the brain stuff

306
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:14,047
Listeners have pointed out on a number of occasions that Alex

307
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,071
Is clearly a prequel

308
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:17,119
That's true

309
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:22,495
So that kind of makes sense if he's more into the Star Wars prequels bad

310
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,775
There is more of a science

311
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:26,847
See you like a f******

312
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:32,223
That's so lame that's so lame that God's ultimate Arbiter requires a f******

313
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:37,343
Well that's because like that that whole like they have to tell you what they're doing

314
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:42,463
Thank the patent number is a little wink for those like Alex who could see through the b*******

315
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,743
Or whatever

316
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,023
Blame then the devil

317
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:48,095
Tell me to get up some creativity

318
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:48,863
Totally

319
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,679
Alex isn't just like basing this on nothing

320
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:56,031
The 666 really important

321
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,639
3pi 6

322
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,527
Secret number

323
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,087
That is the highest secret of the Illuminati

324
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:14,463
Implanted in us as part of a ritual

325
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,351
Directions Believe by the sun god

326
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,727
I feel like Alex might be high

327
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:30,335
420 shows that Alex just pull it out numbers so that we build Magic

328
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:35,711
22 * 3

329
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,991
Magically becomes

330
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:37,759
666

331
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:40,831
33 * pi 66

332
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:44,159
6 something-or-other is a secret number

333
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:46,207
Stop go home 54321

334
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:48,255
So Alex that's

335
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,535
Boat like as big as

336
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,863
Different narrative from other things

337
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,167
We've covered in the grass

338
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:58,751
Leaves me cold

339
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:02,847
I'm not end in Thai

340
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:07,967
Believe that

341
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:11,295
He wants them to keep the I keep his name out their mouth

342
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,391
Joy Behar

343
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,256
The View today

344
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,800
You are essential

345
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:39,456
I look forward to Alex turning this into all the Democrats are saying I'm a terrorist

346
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:42,272
Like really Auto really basic level

347
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:45,856
The only things that he really has the right to be like

348
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:49,184
Really all that mad about our Bill Maher interview

349
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,768
That makes me really sad

350
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,816
It in in contacts

351
00:21:55,584 --> 00:22:01,472
What else what else is he got what else is imaginary

352
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:02,496
What a loser

353
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,520
So Alex

354
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,312
It complains in this next clip

355
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,848
About how Bill Gates

356
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:10,688
And the foundations or whatever they're teaching kids are.

357
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,736
With a little game called

358
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:13,504
Spaceship

359
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:17,600
That's a game they play on Foundation funding in public

360
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,560
Malfunction Arizona food

361
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,376
We have to get rid of a third of the crew

362
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,912
Who is essential

363
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,496
Well we need the chapter moment even scientists what we need to

364
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:42,432
Engineer

365
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:44,736
Engineer volunteer for esta

366
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,528
Blow you out the airlock

367
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,088
Ivolunteer I'm not essential

368
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:51,392
Lifeboat

369
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,768
We're all going to starve to death

370
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,840
Unless somebody dies

371
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:02,144
Time

372
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:05,216
Do we have to die

373
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,752
Don't know if it's going to die

374
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:10,336
Noble to do that

375
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:13,408
You're saying no humans are essential

376
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:17,248
Wild-caught

377
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:23,904
Not sure they are but also I want I can't quite Alex's denying that there are

378
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,440
Situations like those

379
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,976
Describe the most thought experiment

380
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:33,120
Like to volunteer to sacrifice yourself to allow

381
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:35,168
Other people too

382
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:41,568
It's kind of a foundation of

383
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:49,760
Your life so that other people visit is an expression of love and care for other people

384
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:50,784
Globalist

385
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,600
Pressure Jesus into going up on that cross did you know that

386
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:57,696
He didn't want to do that but Bill and Melinda Gates

387
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:04,096
In time they got the globalist brainwashed Elisha

388
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:07,424
I'm not even actually the Son of God they made the whole thing up

389
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,192
Yeah

390
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:14,592
I think that Alex is just maybe mad that one of his kids is learning vitality arianism

391
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:19,456
Okay these are just like really basic philosophical Concepts oh

392
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:24,576
Utilitarianism

393
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,880
Does more people survive

394
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:27,904
Is Lifeboat

395
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,184
Make it

396
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,976
Moral to pressure someone

397
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:33,536
Do not survive in the Lifeboat

398
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,816
It's an open question

399
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:38,656
Have you heard the game that they're playing now with kids it's called

400
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:45,056
Like so you got a train right and you have control over the train and you can either turn it so it kills five people

401
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,336
1 people

402
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:48,640
Have you heard about this game

403
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:50,176
Find a way to kill six people

404
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,968
You have to you have to not

405
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:52,992
Do anything

406
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,016
And it kills

407
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,808
Do something

408
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:02,208
Was like really just like 101 philosophical

409
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,744
6 total

410
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,280
What happened

411
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:07,072
If you multiply that

412
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:11,680
333 phone number

413
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,960
Secret

414
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,776
Back to the mark of the beast idea

415
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:18,592
It's pretty clear that Alex is like

416
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:19,872
This is it

417
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:20,640
This Is the End

418
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:27,040
Next countries news today

419
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,208
Gators today

420
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:41,888
Oh my goodness

421
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:48,288
And goddamn step in Step Up

422
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:51,360
Jay garlick because the

423
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:58,016
That's only in the first

424
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:07,488
Then the shaman

425
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:09,024
Bruce Spring

426
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,328
God dammit

427
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:15,424
Man place

428
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:22,592
Bruce is just going to come.

429
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:26,176
The devil versus God

430
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:33,088
Oh I got out I got daughter

431
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:36,928
He's going to come in he's going to put the globalist into a Tenth Avenue freeze-out

432
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,464
It was going to happen

433
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:46,400
We got we got one scene on drums I'm feeling great about that the force ghost of Clarence Clemons coming back

434
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:49,472
Play some horn

435
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,544
Bro you know it's it's

436
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,896
It seems so crazy to me that whenever these type of guys see there

437
00:26:57,152 --> 00:27:03,296
Personal incoming they always say that the end times are coming is that a weird coincidence

438
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,064
Always happen at this

439
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:06,368
It is very strange so weird

440
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:07,904
I think

441
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,184
I think there is a lot

442
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,536
To the ax perhaps but knows I mean

443
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:19,936
Pretty f*****-up episode like

444
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:27,360
It's not like he's not doing well

445
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:34,016
That also could just be because the Beast is coming I could be that I forgot about.

446
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:38,624
We just played

447
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:39,648
666

448
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:48,864
Does it still count if it supposed to close 6

449
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,888
All right there we go

450
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:50,656
You got me

451
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:51,680
You want

452
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:02,688
Who have understanding reckon the number of the Beast

453
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,248
Fuller's

454
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,272
A human number

455
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:08,576
Sabbath

456
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,392
19

457
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,696
Umbrella man

458
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:19,072
I think that Alex is just riffing from the Iron Maiden song Number of the Beast

459
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,864
Not revelation

460
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,168
The tip-off for me was that he said it was a quote

461
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,704
Quote a human number

462
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:29,056
Which is right from the lyrics of that song but it's not in the Bible

463
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:33,152
Corrected it to quote the number of a man

464
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:36,992
Regardless this theory has had some real problems that he needs to explain

465
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:39,552
The verse is at the mark of the beast according to revelation

466
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:41,600
It is the work of these beasts

467
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:48,000
Like some prophecy coming true

468
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:48,768
Filter

469
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:51,328
Dunn tribute salted Obama

470
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,376
Even be like

471
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:55,424
The second beast is the UN

472
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,008
The first Beast was the League of Nations

473
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:05,408
House is really good if you predicted the entire un being the second base

474
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:07,456
Some good stocks got a baby is the best

475
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:14,112
Yeah Alex's pretty mad about masks masks it's a sign of Yusef

476
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:20,512
Admitting it because he's selling too many of them well that is a conflict even existed missive

477
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,536
Very short clip

478
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:35,616
But I just wanted to

479
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:45,344
Let you in if

480
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:52,256
But only 6 months if you don't

481
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,816
Grocery stores anywhere

482
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:59,168
Right now in Austin

483
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,216
Are black

484
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,520
Infowars.com

485
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:08,384
Shoot your mouth off talk about how it's a fraud plug websites

486
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,176
Whatever

487
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,456
I love

488
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:13,248
The idea that

489
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,016
Look

490
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:20,928
Design of submitting to the globalist agenda

491
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:27,840
I'm sorry I can't take this mask off real quick

492
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:30,144
Have you guys heard about the mark of the beast

493
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,264
Saw it it's a real bad sign

494
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:37,312
Hahaha just

495
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:41,408
Did this is Stacey stupid dumb assholes

496
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,688
Would you like to buy it

497
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:47,808
So this leads to Alex freaking out a little bit could it be selling a story

498
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:48,576
About

499
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:50,112
What happened to him this morning

500
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:52,416
Apparently you want to grocery store

501
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:54,464
People were concerned that he wasn't wearing a mask

502
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,256
So he starts yelling at them

503
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:59,584
Course maybe got escorted out by security

504
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,400
Clear from the telling of this story

505
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:04,704
The store this morning

506
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:06,240
Buy some groceries

507
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,872
Where you stupid gloves

508
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:17,504
Do something

509
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,576
I see how it makes everybody a suspect

510
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:24,672
What is xiumin called essential others are called non-essential

511
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,208
That's beyond racism

512
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:29,792
Subhuman

513
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:35,680
And I said no

514
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:45,664

518
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:05,120

Put you under their control

523
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:39,680
Not good

524
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,960
So close

525
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:48,128
I don't believe that story happen necessarily but if it didn't happen quite like that

526
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,224
Small security cameras

527
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:54,784
Sir sir why are you so angry

528
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:55,808

529
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:56,576
The new zombies

530
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:59,136

Hey everybody not wearing masks in here you are absolutely right but also you need to buy Mass to be in here

533
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,704
Imagine Medical

534
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:13,728
That's that's

535
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:14,752
Pretty fun

536
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:17,568

537
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:20,128
That is why I'm selling masks to you

538
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:24,992
This Nightclub not quite as fun Alex has a bit of a

539
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:31,392
Conspiracy about hospitals being empty

540
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:40,096
That's a doctor's order just drinking vodka and f******

541
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,400
I'll leave it at that

542
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,936
They're doctors and nurses

543
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,008
I don't believe you

544
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,616
Indiana California other places

545
00:33:54,944 --> 00:34:00,320
Giant VA Hospital

546
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:05,696
Why

547
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:08,256
This is a giant vacation

548
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:11,840
Okay

549
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,424
Because the insurance companies

550
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,544
All of these opium

551
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:24,640
What

552
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,968
Do Anthony surgery areas and they'll get

553
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:30,784
Harper digit

554
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,552
This is back

555
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,648
Seems unconnected as a thought maybe

556
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:38,464
Hundreds of them out of the hospital

557
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:51,264
2030 Anastasia

558
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:53,824
Everywhere

559
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:57,920
But the Opium addiction despise

560
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:11,488
Text parking lot

561
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,024
A joke

562
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:15,584
That's not sad experience that I've heard from

563
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,608
Somebody

564
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:21,984
Care Professionals by whatever Alex

565
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:25,312
I mean like I don't know maybe maybe his dad

566
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:28,128
Is it

567
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:30,176
I'm just drinking booze

568
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:32,992
Drunken noodle okay having barbecues of his Park

569
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:38,368
What I would say that I needs a little more than Alex's supposed to relatives

570
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:39,904
Word on

571
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,720
I don't think Anonymous sources are the way I'm going to go on the

572
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:48,352
So there's something that I was hasn't said

573
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,120
Yet

574
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:52,704
Uno's

575
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,472
Or something

576
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:55,776
This is really mysterious and I'm not

577
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:58,336
I'm not entirely sure what he's trying to get out

578
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:03,456
I'm not joking I'm doing the show and then I'm eloquently in most cases covering all those facts

579
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:05,760
Eloquently

580
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:10,880
There's something I haven't said yet

581
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,544
Conscious all but your conscience should notice

582
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:33,664
Do you think about all day

583
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:39,040
About that business partnering

584
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:41,600
Commenced

585
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:44,160
What did miss it was fraud or

586
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:48,768
Your daughter you didn't notice at the time but later you thought about it in

587
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:53,888
Conscious is a thousand times or more

588
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,752
He called the subconscious the connection of the universe it's not just

589
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:00,544
Medical Orion

590
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:05,920
When I come back from break because I wasn't able to segment in Anaheim

591
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,456
To Shook Up do it again

592
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:17,440
Epic this is so real is everything happen when it was coming and I just

593
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:24,864
Where watch billions died

594
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:29,984
Murdering people in mash and people are just dying everywhere

595
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,776
Finally wake up

596
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,360
Something up here

597
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:39,456
He's not saying what this thing is

598
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,992
Not positive that he does

599
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:46,112
It's weird civilians are going to die but you need to understand about that

600
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:48,672
Is it there is a bit of a timeline issue

601
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:50,720
They're not really clear on sure

602
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:51,744
Could be tomorrow

603
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,792
Could be five years

604
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:54,560
Take more time than

605
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,840
Tomorrow

606
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:56,608
75 years

607
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:01,216
5 years ago

608
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,824
We're going to see the Antichrist they're going to be having sex with kids on TV

609
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,640
You're going to see

610
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:13,504
Ocean die in nuclear war billions dead

611
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:21,440
Unconnected

612
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:27,328
Oceans are going to die God sucks if he's real in oceans are going to death

613
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:33,984
Probably just because

614
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,520
A lot of his doing

615
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:39,872
So Alex is talking about like there's a difference

616
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,408
You know you have your soul

617
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:42,688
Give your flesh

618
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,504
No you just have one spot in your brain which is also party

619
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,648
Prisma captain that one part of your brain that they're trying to get rid of

620
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,768
According to Alex because if you can get a back seat ruined your soul

621
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,816
Then it's physical thing

622
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,096
Who cares

623
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:01,632
Alex believes that the

624
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:02,400
Flash

625
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,680
Wants to side with Sade

626
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:04,448
Ensure

627
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:07,264
The fight my flesh My Flesh

628
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:16,224
Play sadness and submit to the New World Order

629
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:17,760
Your flash

630
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:21,344
It kind of wants to side with Satan

631
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,392
Decide what my spirit is like

632
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:31,328
Get out of your pee

633
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,240
Get me out of here get me out of here get me out of here

634
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:43,616
Oh no my friend here going to

635
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,320
My children and my family

636
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:54,880
Godlike hey you decided to have them

637
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:57,440
If their Spirit right getting close to godson

638
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,208
Why you still

639
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:01,280
Because I'm going to destroy the Earth

640
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,888
Okay

641
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:09,984
Is he just an alcoholic is that

642
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,776
I'm not positive

643
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:12,800
Face the Dragon

644
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:17,152
Trying to get me a legendary wolf

645
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:22,528
You know what do they think it's interesting that he's presenting his dichotomy between his Flagship his spirit

646
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:29,952
Go to that must stand up inside

647
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:34,816
Right you said explicitly multiple times that his plan is to go to a

648
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:37,120
Seems like his flashes

649
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,656
Oh yeah it's already

650
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:44,288
Express the plan to follow the flash what did you not know he got the MMR vaccine

651
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:49,664
Is connection to the spirit world

652
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,504
Manny's in connection with spirit world

653
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:54,784
Alex is Flash

654
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,808
Is evil

655
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:56,576
He wants you to know that

656
00:40:58,112 --> 00:41:01,184
I mean I already assumed that

657
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:01,952
Is Flash

658
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:13,728
Balisco military 11

659
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:17,056
My God

660
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:20,128
Conscious

661
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,272
Cuz I know you're there too

662
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,552
I am not

663
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:28,576
Addieville

664
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:42,400
We know

665
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:45,216
Oh yeah God do is not something I want

666
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:50,848
Big boy pants on

667
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:52,640
Because

668
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:58,015
Because you are facing your watching an interdimensional satanic

669
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:10,047
Fish in the science fiction movie it's not something

670
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,887
To the Draco Maybe

671
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:17,215
You talk to Carrie about this you been Consulting kept in Park Ridge

672
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:22,591
I was thinking earlier that is his view on how is flesh and spirit

673
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:23,871
Eerily similar to

674
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,151
Carrie being like

675
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:31,551
No you can only get the virus if you will visit if your will is broken and you can't fight it off with your own brain powers

676
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:36,159
There's there's some similarities pretty deeply into like

677
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:42,559
You know the interdimensional attack happening it might as well be aliens

678
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:45,631
No it's the end times

679
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:48,703
Sure

680
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:50,239
Being announced through this patent

681
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:52,799
Intercourse and Alex

682
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:53,823
Kind of

683
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:54,591
Giving up

684
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:58,687
Huseby makes it pretty clear in this next clip

685
00:42:58,943 --> 00:42:59,711
Find

686
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:02,271
Very outside of the norm for his rhetoric

687
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,551
No one can

688
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:04,575
Can beat this

689
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:06,367
No one can be.

690
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,415
Better get on your knees

691
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,255
You better get on your knees before the Creator

692
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:15,839
None of us with no matter how strong we are

693
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:18,399
We cannot

694
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:20,959
I tell you that

695
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,639
Not happy right now

696
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:31,711
I wouldn't you be happy

697
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:35,295
What the hell does that mean

698
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,111
Do you not understand the words

699
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:41,183
Thousand-Year information

700
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:43,743
God literally

701
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:53,471
Do you think there's all that damn game phone

702
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:55,263
Is the real deal

703
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:56,799
This isn't a simulation

704
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:01,919
Solar system

705
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:05,759
Built For This operation

706
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:11,647
You don't think God created beings with free will

707
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:14,719
How are the universe right away

708
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:16,511
What

709
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:19,071
Image of God

710
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:20,095
With free will

711
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:24,959
Red

712
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:33,151
So I mean that's just the this world is a test

713
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:34,431
Interesting to me

714
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:37,503
It is interesting that he saying that no one can beat this

715
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:44,159
Regular info

716
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:44,927
The devil

717
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:48,255
August 1st once at the bar

718
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:53,375
Robert why we're going to take you down finished

719
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:54,399
Do you know what hey

720
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,423
You can't win

721
00:44:55,679 --> 00:45:01,823
Yeah, seems like that means that people should stop funding the info the only reason that you fund

722
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:08,223
So we can fight that you were funding a Winning Side

723
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:12,319
Boats but whatever I mean

724
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:17,695
Yeah I guess you bought him an armored

725
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:23,071
Cuz of God because you bought so much my Patriot Supply he got a really good deal

726
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:24,607
Yeah yeah so great

727
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:25,631
Oh boy

728
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:29,983
The reason why we can't win is because these are bullies Spaceteam

729
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:31,775
They were fighting against

730
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:34,847
And Alex discusses how they operate

731
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,383
These are

732
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:37,919
Bad preachers

733
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:44,319
You're ugly to the Earth

734
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,343
Isak

735
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,879
We got rid of

736
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:52,255
Everywhere these entities go in Creation in the universe

737
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:54,303
They are throwing out on their asses

738
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,583
Where else have they gone

739
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:58,399
And so these are bullies

740
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:03,263
God can't even comprehend.

741
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:05,567
Around

742
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:13,759
That is a really great question that you asked because it doesn't fly there are a ton of inhabited planets

743
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:18,879
These bullies face Stevens have gone to wherever it out of here get out of here by Steven

744
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:22,975
That is a piece that Alex does not unpack question support

745
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:26,815
Patrol around the universe going to other uninhabited on Mercantile.

746
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:32,959
Okay I'll get logical cats and kicked off that planet

747
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:34,239
Looking for

748
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:35,263
An egg

749
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:42,687
Giant space baby

750
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,575
The engine hear me though

751
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:57,791
Area for it

752
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,607
Like a virus

753
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,655
The planets

754
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:03,935
All eggs

755
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:10,847
Get in

756
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:11,871
To tell us

757
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:12,639
What to do

758
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:13,663
So

759
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:15,455
That's what's going on

760
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:17,759
Demons

761
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:24,159
Space Belize

762
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:26,463
Kindergarten cross that one off and we officially have bingo

763
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:31,327
So earlier Alex said he has his flesh

764
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:32,095
Is a spirit

765
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:34,399
Spirit says fight the dragon right

766
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:35,167
Flash says

767
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:35,935
Leave

768
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:41,567
Hi up let's get your face with the dragon

769
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:42,335
Precious one

770
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:46,943
Directive

771
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:49,247
Impossible

772
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:56,159
In the mud

773
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:58,463
Spiritual nature of having chickens

774
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:00,767
The nature looking up at the stars at night

775
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:07,423
We have to nail move from warning about the mark of the beast

776
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:10,495
The moving into the defensive posture

777
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:17,407
You're awesome taking your kids and cut your heads off the bed

778
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:20,479
What

779
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:22,527
We've done our work

780
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:26,367
Broadcast

781
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:31,231
Affordable Suits now

782
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:37,375
As long as possible

783
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:38,399
That is amazing

784
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,167
Why

785
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:44,543
Why would I

786
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:49,919
For your own purposes perhaps but in terms of like

787
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:51,455
To get it so Alex can

788
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:54,015
Make money stupid

789
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:58,367
I mean like when I heard that clip the only thing I could think is are clotted for Wars over

790
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:01,695
Like that you were you've lost the info or not exactly

791
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:06,303
There isn't anything else to do I will be on the air for a while maybe we'll stick around

792
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:09,631
If you give us some more about who try to stick around but

793
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:12,447
There's nothing you can do the enemies can't be defeated

794
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:15,519
Whatever I'm going to go put my feet in the mud

795
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:18,079
F****** procor that was

796
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:19,103
Chicken

797
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:20,895
Starting his own reasoning

798
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:25,247
You're better off getting your head chopped off then buying store

799
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:31,391
Yeah be right with God but you can buy my food

800
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:32,159
Kill yourself

801
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:33,183
YouTube

802
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:38,815
The the other thing too that I kept thinking about during the eclipse was there like back in 2017

803
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:42,399
I don't remember what episode was on but there was an episode where Alex is crying

804
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:45,215
Talking about how you wished you was just a farmer

805
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:51,359
The life he should be living as he should have made a bunch of money on the supplements and stuff

806
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:53,663
A gotten outrageous hide

807
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,711
Take a new life

808
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:57,759
Yep Wyatt away from everything

809
00:49:58,015 --> 00:50:00,575
There was no end to this that was good

810
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:01,599
If he could have

811
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:05,183
Gotten out then no one would have probably even considered

812
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:10,559
All the things that are getting him sued now so like those lawsuits wouldn't exist

813
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:13,375
He could just have a really happy life with his chickens

814
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:19,519
Many crops need more than a couple million dollars probably to live out the rest of his life

815
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:22,335
Insomnia

816
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:25,151
He's going to be too

817
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:26,687
Probably

818
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:29,503
That that's like oh that's a realistic thing

819
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:35,903
He couldn't have done you f***** up yeah back then he was crying about how he wished that's what he was going to do and now hit the

820
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,439
Appears that the universe made of forest

821
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:39,999
And now he's going to do that but it's going to

822
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:41,279
Also come along with

823
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:43,583
A real public Fall From Grace

824
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:45,631
Is going to be

825
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:49,983
An extent to which like he's going to have to take

826
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:51,263
Compare

827
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:57,919
Who knows but like he knows that this is Bissell

828
00:50:58,175 --> 00:51:04,319
Is Don pretty much over

829
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:07,647
2nd nature he kept stopping

830
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:11,231
If you wasn't selling anything you'd still do an ad pivot just did nothing

831
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:13,535
Well we're here just so you know

832
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:19,679
Just go ahead and get your nothing anywhere you got it we got it in store for 4999 if you get it on auto-ship

833
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:21,471
You get it for 4599

834
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:23,007
Again it is not

835
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:25,823
Don't worry about it just give me 45.

836
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:32,735
So he's ceu selling the food there that leads to hand sanitizer that he

837
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:43,487
Sanitizer

838
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:46,815
Eucalyptus peppermint

839
00:51:56,543 --> 00:52:02,687
Attack formation

840
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:09,343
Weird

841
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:15,999
If you give us money you know who keep us afloat yeah destructions going to be spectacular

842
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:17,791
Well now

843
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:19,327
Now you're just buying fireworks

844
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:25,727
The more money you give him the more spectacular

845
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:27,775
Try to be more money

846
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:33,919
Knots that doesn't Inspire confidence that feels pretty bad

847
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:35,967
Just a nice little

848
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:39,807
Controlled burn do you want a hood and with a

849
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,087
Your choice

850
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:42,367
Your choice

851
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:43,391
We're going to have

852
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:46,207
We're going to do a Facebook poll will see how you guys do

853
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:49,535
It cost one bottle of Beethoven to vote

854
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:55,423
I don't really care about it's not really important but I'm going to play it just for fun

855
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:57,471
To give you

856
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:58,751
Demonstration

857
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:05,407
Do you want to see what the modern Hitler looks like bug

858
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:11,807
Zuckerberg

859
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:18,207
All the time and I never play it I never play things like that because that would be stupid right that would be

860
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:20,511
I know he met Mark Zuckerberg

861
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:24,607
Other one right people misspeak all the time

862
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:28,447
It's not like hey Alex you're so stupid you don't even know it's Mark Zuckerberg

863
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:34,847
But you know what there are people who do s*** like that Alex would probably do something like that

864
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:41,247
Losi clip where she speaks and he's like

865
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:43,807
Employees doing

866
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:44,575
What the f***

867
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:48,671
This is I wanted to play with as a demonstration just to be like

868
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:51,999
I could do that to any point

869
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:52,767
Yeah because

870
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:55,839
6.8 people misspeak

871
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:57,375
Any wife

872
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,911
This is where things get real

873
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:00,191
Alex

874
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:02,239
May have tried to make

875
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:03,007
Some

876
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:04,799
Kind of social media website

877
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:06,335
Sure

878
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:08,127
I don't know what this is about

879
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:11,199
But apparently it failed

880
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:16,831
You know I create a website

881
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:23,999
That offer me again of the email I'll cover right now actually get that

882
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:31,423
Everybody always trying to use Twitter

883
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:32,959
Facebook

884
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:36,543
Could we create a website and get people's emails

885
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:41,151
Take it down so I can go right

886
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:47,551
Because we're

887
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:49,343
Habituated

888
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:52,159
The Facebook and Twitter and Google

889
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:01,631
I want to promote the site we launched

890
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:15,711
You programmed it's over man

891
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:17,247
He wants

892
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:18,271
They

893
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:19,295
Get

894
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:20,319
You

895
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:21,343
Programmed

896
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:35,935
Aldous Harding

897
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:40,031
Let's go ahead and

898
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:43,103
That is very important

899
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:57,695
Whew Alex leaves again

900
00:55:57,951 --> 00:56:01,023
It's like everyday now

901
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:02,303
I can't do the Shelf

902
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:04,351
And you'll just play special reports

903
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:05,119
Let's

904
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:07,679
I know that in the past like

905
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:11,263
Even outside of our little like maybe last six-month time frame

906
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:17,663
There were occasional times and he would do when he would do that but it was usually pretty extreme for him to leave the show

907
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:24,319
I guess go do an interview on another show right reason for it

908
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:25,343
Oblong or something

909
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:27,135
It's everyday now and it's

910
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:27,903
Only

911
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:28,671
Is

912
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:29,951
Like feeling yeah

913
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:31,999
And his feelings are

914
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:34,047
Try to make a f****** social media

915
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:35,327
It doesn't work

916
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:36,863
No one wants it

917
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:39,679
F*** it I'm just coming

918
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:43,007
Why would we launch this until

919
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:44,543
Done

920
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:45,567
As a really good question

921
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:47,615
I keep hearing is just in

922
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:50,431
A consistent and insinuations that like

923
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:51,199
F*** it

924
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:52,991
F*** it there's no Road left

925
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:54,015
Confronted

926
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:55,295
The wheels are off

927
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:56,575
We were done

928
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:57,343
We're basically

929
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,135
It feels like he's wrapping up

930
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:02,207
The show without actually saying yeah yeah

931
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:04,767
Absolutely even if he didn't

932
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:06,047
I just don't

933
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:09,119
I can't escape that like

934
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:12,703
That's the escalation towards

935
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:18,079
Revelation the Deep state

936
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:19,359
If it's just

937
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:22,687
Yeah he is existing through the end times

938
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:24,991
And I think he would prefer it

939
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:26,271
If everyone else was

940
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:27,807
To he's very disappointed that

941
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:29,855
Seems to be the only person is really getting

942
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:30,623
End times

943
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:35,743
Narcissists love it when other people feel the same

944
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:39,071
So Alex talked a little bit more gear about his experience

945
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:40,351
At the store this morning

946
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:41,375
What are y'all two people

947
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:43,935
Whole new area

948
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:50,847
This morning and people get to my face about the bass

949
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:09,023
Stupid mask you're selling them also

950
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:13,119
A mask isn't 100

951
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:14,655
Assigned to protect you

952
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:17,471
From Catching something as much as

953
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:20,543
Does it is to protect other people in case you are

954
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:21,823
I already sick

955
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:28,479
Part of what makes vaccines functional is it makes it

956
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:33,087
So you can't give it to other people who are either immunocompromised

957
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:39,487
Take vaccines for some reason it's it's more protective for other people really sexy large

958
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:40,255
Part of

959
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:41,791
The rationale for

960
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:44,095
Announcers doesn't understand that

961
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:44,863
The globalist

962
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:47,167
To want you to protect other people

963
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:52,031
Can like we've seen they want you to line up and sacrifice yourself or others so

964
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:54,079
That means that helping other people

965
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:55,871
People is actually part of the globalist

966
00:58:56,127 --> 00:59:02,271
Altruism is a plan of the Bowie Space demons who go around and find eggs

967
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:03,551
How else would they trick us

968
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:09,183
Play Alex believes of the globalist they're trying to take his kids

969
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:09,951
Well

970
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:22,751
Public

971
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:27,871
That's

972
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:29,151
2020

973
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:32,479
April 20th that's where we are

974
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:35,039
But that's not anything other than your ex-wife

975
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:40,927
That's your ex-wife globalists

976
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:47,583
Their mother whose concern for their well-being because you went to a f****** rally in the middle of a pandemic

977
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:52,447
Yeah you put your kids in danger in theory yes the argument could be made pretty wild that is the case

978
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:55,263
I will talk about the the custody stuff

979
00:59:55,519 --> 01:00:00,127
On this at the show for a very specific reason as I've no idea what's going on

980
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:05,503
Interpersonal level is not our business Alex tries to present like

981
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:09,599
Flight being some sort of politically-motivated thing as opposed to it being

982
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:13,695
This is a dispute between you and your ex-wife don't try and pretend

983
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:15,231
That this is some Soros

984
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:18,047
Plan Gates trying to take you out

985
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:20,095
Cockamamie b*******

986
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:24,447
And that's that that is again the same sort of thing that I think

987
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:26,239
Like through almost all of Alex

988
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:27,263
Stop this

989
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:29,567
The perception that he

990
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:30,591
Is this

991
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:32,639
Drastic political purse

992
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:33,407
Persecution

993
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:35,967
And it's massive fight against demonic

994
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:37,247
Otherworldly

995
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:38,783
Forces and what have you

996
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:39,807
I really

997
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:42,367
It's just ups and downs in his personal life

998
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:44,671
And he can never be

999
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:49,023
Can Satan never see himself as anything other than the champion and the good guy

1000
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:50,047
At no point

1001
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:53,375
Point-in-time could he ever for once Avid moment of introspection

1002
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:59,775
And be like oh yeah so you know I mean it is kind of reasonable to think that if I go out and share it

1003
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:04,383
Space with a lot of other people who may be infected then I'm putting my children at risk so

1004
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:09,503
My ex-wife very logically would say that I should not be anywhere near my children

1005
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:10,527
This makes perfect

1006
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:13,087
I made a mistake

1007
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:17,951
I don't know all the like variables are play but I just think like on a very basic level

1008
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:19,231
You do have a pretty

1009
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:24,095
Decent argument that if someone is behaving in ways that are going to make them more likely

1010
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:26,143
To possibly catch this

1011
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:27,679
That's awesome babe

1012
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:28,447
Don't

1013
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:29,727
They should be

1014
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:32,287
Sequestered

1015
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:34,847
I don't know you should we should

1016
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:35,615
She probably

1017
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:36,895
Put some

1018
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:39,199
Aluminum on top of his door

1019
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:39,967
Make sure that

1020
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:40,735
He's not a vampire

1021
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:45,087
What if he's a vampire

1022
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:51,487
That was that the only thing that makes sense to me at this point isolate himself

1023
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:57,631
Beast kids are filled with blood and he loves that s*** now he's in trouble

1024
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:58,399
Could be

1025
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:02,751
Mentioned earlier the David Icke was coming up

1026
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:04,287
Scrape man

1027
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:06,591
Great this is bad news

1028
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:07,359
I want to hear

1029
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:08,127
From David Icke

1030
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:14,527
This is bad news bad is really what I was looking for a lot of people

1031
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:16,063
Leave it to David Icke

1032
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:18,111
To try and outdo all of them

1033
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:26,303
Ocean

1034
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:34,751
Oh boy

1035
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:40,639
So David Icke believes that there is no virus

1036
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:43,199
Fake virus

1037
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:45,247
What you mean

1038
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:50,623
Oh maybe or maybe it's just other things that are being called

1039
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:52,159
Covid-19

1040
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:55,231
Maybe it's 5G I've no f****** idea

1041
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:58,559
This is interesting though because Alex at all always been trying

1042
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:00,607
To present it as David Icke was talking

1043
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:07,007
About 5G

1044
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:08,799
There's no virus because there isn't

1045
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:12,895
And that's the point that he's making on this episode

1046
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:13,919
And what's interesting

1047
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:14,943
Is the Alex

1048
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:16,991
Carnival Cruises

1049
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:20,319
They're not debating it almost all the tests false identify

1050
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:22,367
Coronavirus is dead

1051
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:24,671
Whether you're totally right it's all fake

1052
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:31,071
Alex's order coming

1053
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:35,935
Coming around a little is like saying that there is no virus

1054
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:40,543
Nothing you can say

1055
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:44,127
Right on there are these

1056
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:45,919
Tested false positive

1057
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:48,735
Talk myself into this

1058
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:49,503
Realize

1059
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:53,343
There is no spoon did you realize what there's no smoke

1060
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:56,415
It takes almost no time at all for David

1061
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:58,207
To convince Alex that there isn't

1062
01:03:58,463 --> 01:03:59,231
Antivirus

1063
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:06,655
You can lose control of it

1064
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:34,559
If you

1065
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:41,215
You

1066
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:07,327
Wow

1067
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:08,863
That was fast

1068
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:11,679
That's pretty amazing

1069
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:15,263
He put together a really good argument for why it's not a biome

1070
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:19,615
Because it would be a bad idea to release a bioweapons we said that matzo

1071
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:20,383
Exactly

1072
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:21,919
So that's a good argument

1073
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:23,199
For why it's not a biome

1074
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:24,991
His next step

1075
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:26,527
I think is where he falls

1076
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:33,183
That's usually how it goes a David ATVs bad for you

1077
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:36,767
Lizards

1078
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:39,583
Answer I can't go long you there

1079
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:41,631
What's interesting to me about this

1080
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:42,911
Is

1081
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:43,935
That

1082
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:45,727
For Alex to believe

1083
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:47,263
That this is a fake virus

1084
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:48,799
He has to

1085
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:50,079
Get rid of

1086
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:51,359
So much

1087
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:52,127
Dial

1088
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:53,407
The whole thing

1089
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:54,687
The game of function

1090
01:05:54,943 --> 01:06:01,087
Whole thing about the UNC Chapel Hill

1091
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:04,159
That was dumb

1092
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:10,559
Viruses are fake but the perception of a virus I like it I like this for him as a noodle

1093
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:12,607
Action to go in

1094
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:16,703
Well yes that incredibly stupid so why not just go even further

1095
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:21,055
Go harder band I mean it's the difference between trying to construct

1096
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:22,847
Conspiracy narrative

1097
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:26,943
And just engaging in blind to nihilist

1098
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:27,967
No

1099
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:34,623
You don't like it

1100
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:41,791
Because it's not true

1101
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:43,071
Why not

1102
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:49,471
Just do it like this especially not over for Humanity and there will be way more than

1103
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:53,055
Survivors mainly because apparently the virus didn't even exist in the first place

1104
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:54,079
Man

1105
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:56,895
Yeah Mike Adams is a really bad Health rating

1106
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:59,967
He doesn't know what he's talking about

1107
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:03,807
This is such a Hallmark of Alex's ship though like

1108
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:05,087
This is why you so stupid

1109
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:06,367
That's because like

1110
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:09,951
That is him agreeing with David Icke

1111
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:13,535
Later though I captured by tomorrow he'll be like

1112
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:15,839
We're just discussing both sides

1113
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:22,495
I have opposing viewpoints the conversation

1114
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:23,519
We talked and you know what

1115
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:29,919
Everybody I believe is very trustworthy sometimes I will agree with something that completely wipes

1116
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:30,687
About the past

1117
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:36,575
Months of my reporting I would largely agree with just about anything some crazy wingdings has to be on my show

1118
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:38,623
That being said

1119
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:45,023
Contradiction

1120
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:46,303
Explicitly said

1121
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:50,143
And I'll still agree with them because they're crazy it is fun

1122
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:55,775
This is where I want the spirit of Bill Cooper to come in and just s*** all over.

1123
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:58,847
David Icke be nice

1124
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:03,199
He did not like David Icke as well that's that's for sure

1125
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:06,271
Here is I

1126
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:10,111
I hate to say this because I obviously can't prove this

1127
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:12,671
But the sense that I get is a pay-to-play

1128
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:13,695
Situation

1129
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:14,463
I

1130
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:20,607
Kind of feel like David Icke might be paying for airtime Alex is profiting off this because

1131
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:27,007
There is a trend that goes through this like the interviewers Alex's is letting David Icke say all this stuff

1132
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:27,775
Invariably

1133
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:30,847
Sporadically not interrupting him all that much

1134
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:31,871
And then

1135
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:33,919
After a couple segments

1136
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:38,783
Alex is like for my own selfish reasons I want to talk about what I want to talk about

1137
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:40,831
If this is one example of a

1138
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:56,191
Hospital

1139
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:57,215
Should be

1140
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:06,175
3/4 a lot of great points in your main topic what about

1141
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:08,223
400,000 signatures

1142
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:11,807
We'll pass the number they need a lot out. Gunn daveste bowling 12-gauge

1143
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:18,463
I don't know if that proves anything but there's a real feeling of like all right you had your time now

1144
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:25,119
I could think of you also just be an arrangement between the two of them because like

1145
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:26,399
For both of us

1146
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:28,703
I don't know it's it's very weird there's there's a

1147
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:32,031
There's a dynamic it plays that is not organic

1148
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:33,567
It is not normal

1149
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:36,895
I think that might be a part of why Alex is so

1150
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:38,687
Happy to be like

1151
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:43,551
That makes total sense that have a fake virus if you want to control it yeah

1152
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:44,575
Because he's

1153
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:47,391
Basically in agreement of some sort to

1154
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:49,695
Platform David Icke idea

1155
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:52,255
Ben. s*** on them if you'd like to know

1156
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:56,607
I have proven this is a real virus and

1157
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:59,423
It is a Franken virus yep

1158
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:01,983
With HIV parts inside

1159
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:08,383
It's been literally proven he said many many times

1160
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:11,199
Can't be swayed by David Icke saying it's fake

1161
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:12,223
You can't

1162
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:14,783
Fake fruit

1163
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:17,343
I mean obviously the proving is fake

1164
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:21,183
I could also so you just Alex

1165
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:22,719
Not giving a s***

1166
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:23,487
At all

1167
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:29,887
That at that you know if he if he's willing to walk off his show just special

1168
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:32,959
Video I could see him taking this opportunity to be like

1169
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:33,727
1

1170
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:35,263
I got my sandwich ready

1171
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:36,287
Had to

1172
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:40,383
I don't have to work right now I'll just chimed in and be like yeah that sounds right

1173
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:47,039
Possible explanations

1174
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:49,855
And the only reason that comes to mind

1175
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:50,879
For me is I like

1176
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:57,279
This is exactly how it would play out if it was like brokered programming

1177
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:02,399
Just like whatever the f*** I don't care say whatever you want to say

1178
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:06,751
Bandidas ideas about and then you'll help me with my s***

1179
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:09,567
Sell anything of his own me I'm sure it's between

1180
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:12,895
Katana ship on the show

1181
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:15,199
See that would make me like is also like

1182
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:21,599
Much more established and find that I'm being sued by everybody

1183
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:29,279
I'm sure that you more like to get out the there is no virus

1184
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:33,887
Alex needs

1185
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:35,423
Do use them as best you can

1186
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:40,031
And so does and I'll tell you unless you're clear on a major operation interested level as they can

1187
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:42,335
And the fact we're here bring you guys like David Icke

1188
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:44,895
But they've already went one use food to control you

1189
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:46,943
Will high-quality trouble food

1190
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:48,991
Nobody else does these prices

1191
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:52,319
No it's all me David Icke saying they're going to use food to control you but you can

1192
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:54,367
Control back by buying my food

1193
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:56,671
Okay

1194
01:11:56,927 --> 01:12:03,071
The main thing like David Ike's interviews are always so goddamn boring in the end

1195
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:04,351
The same sort of stopped

1196
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:06,143
Over and over again with weird

1197
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:09,727
Noises and stuff awful

1198
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:12,287
Big thing is there is Novi

1199
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:13,823
That is his

1200
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:14,847
Pieces

1201
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:16,127
For this

1202
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:18,431
Which makes it troubling this

1203
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:31,231
Mainstream calls

1204
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:37,631
Get what you're after Alex Jones

1205
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:47,359
You don't even have Spirit behind that s***

1206
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:51,455
Call Elizabeth interview

1207
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:52,991
Play happier

1208
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:54,015
Expat

1209
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:58,111
They are like this is a better way to go

1210
01:12:58,367 --> 01:13:01,183
Just deny the virus

1211
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:06,815
Some of the people on the staff

1212
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:09,631
At a point where they realize I

1213
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:15,007
We're in over our head we're on the water

1214
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:18,335
Gone all over the place and and not found respite

1215
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:19,615
Baby

1216
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:22,943
Faver-dykes there is no virus narrative is the simplest solution

1217
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:25,759
Yeah that doesn't seem like the path of least resistance

1218
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:27,295
It would have been

1219
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:30,879
But the problem now is explaining away view old narratives

1220
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:33,183
Like you if you now shift

1221
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:34,719
Do there is no virus

1222
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:39,071
You have to explain why you were wrong when you proved that there was

1223
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:40,863
Vagina Georgia

1224
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:42,655
I know you and I would

1225
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:45,471
Yeah

1226
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:47,007
It's real frustrating

1227
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:49,567
So this

1228
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:51,615
This is the thing that I find the most interesting

1229
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:53,407
This entire episode picture

1230
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:54,175
Alex

1231
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:56,991
Reporting on patent 666 or whatever is

1232
01:13:57,247 --> 01:13:58,783
That's that's whatever

1233
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:00,319
Little bit

1234
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:01,599
Boring

1235
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:06,719
I find it fascinating to David Icke is allowed to come on his show and say there is no virus

1236
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:07,743
And he agrees

1237
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:09,535
And he's convinced

1238
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:15,167
Are you going to fit into a conditional could instantly

1239
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:21,311
After after that clip I played he's convinced David I can walk back a little bit

1240
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:22,591
But you can't

1241
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:24,895
If you believe anything that you're saying

1242
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:27,455
You can't even conditionally agree with her

1243
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:28,735
You know thing

1244
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:30,783
You don't

1245
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:32,831
Pink things you know things

1246
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:34,879
Oh no here I got this

1247
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:36,159
I got this easily for you

1248
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:36,927
Okay

1249
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:38,207
There is a virus

1250
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:39,743
But it was not release

1251
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:44,863
So all of the proof about them selling the virus and all that stuff that's all true

1252
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:45,631
However

1253
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:49,727
They just have the virus and they never actually released the virus

1254
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:51,519
Only because they have the virus

1255
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:53,311
They can say they release the virus

1256
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:55,871
To create the panic and then if anybody asks WI

1257
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:58,431
I've got the virus right here I know it's real

1258
01:14:58,687 --> 01:14:59,199
Done

1259
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:05,855
Figured it out there is a virus and I've even proven that to me I agree with there being nobody

1260
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:09,183
Jordan is just done the work for you

1261
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:11,487
It took a long time

1262
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:12,511
So the other thing

1263
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:15,071
Beyond is just this sense of Doom

1264
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:19,935
Like Alex saying that there is no way to win

1265
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:21,471
I'm going to the woods

1266
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:22,239
F*** it

1267
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:25,055
8 minutes out the show ends to

1268
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:30,687
The time is coming up hopefully with connections ready

1269
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:34,783
AR

1270
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:44,255
Prodigy the game

1271
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:48,607
Capitol Beer and like beating somebody attacks but

1272
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:55,007
I just didn't hit it before it spread the word usually more going to like these horrible to India right now

1273
01:15:58,079 --> 01:15:59,103
That's not

1274
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:02,431
Does this feeling of like

1275
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:03,711
Buy this stuff

1276
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:08,319
We're done anyway I thought we had money to make it the rest of the year

1277
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:09,087
Ouija

1278
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:15,231
Yeah and I mean like we talked about the the bankruptcy case on our last step

1279
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:18,047
Episode and I'm 50-50 on thinking like that

1280
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:19,327
It felt like

1281
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:21,631
This is this is a real

1282
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:22,655
Eminem

1283
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:24,191
Feeling

1284
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:27,007
I really don't think that you would be feeling

1285
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:29,055
I don't think you be acting like this

1286
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:30,335
If it weren't

1287
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:32,895
If it were just a situation with this abstract

1288
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:36,735
November or whatever end-of-the-year court date for

1289
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:38,271
Sandy Hook stop

1290
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:40,319
Don't think he'd be acting like this

1291
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:41,855
If it was these

1292
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:48,255
Warnings that he's gotten from the FDA and the New York attorney general because those things are things that

1293
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:49,279
He can result

1294
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:51,839
Yeah he can't change his actions

1295
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:53,631
And cooperate with the process

1296
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:55,935
And continued without any consequences

1297
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:57,727
There's something like this

1298
01:16:57,983 --> 01:17:00,031
Sword of Damocles hanging over his head

1299
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:03,871
And I can't tell how much of this is me talking myself into believing

1300
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:05,407
Yeah that's a good question

1301
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:08,479
It definitely feels like he's fun

1302
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:09,503
And he knows

1303
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:11,295
And it's not like

1304
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:15,135
In the past where he you know he's doing this and then

1305
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:17,951
You know he'll just bounced back the next day

1306
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:18,975
This seems like

1307
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:20,511
He's already for like

1308
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:21,535
Resigned

1309
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:23,839
To the point where he's saying

1310
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:26,399
It doesn't matter if you buy buy food

1311
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:27,935
We're all going to die anyway

1312
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:30,239
Like there is no way to win

1313
01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:31,007
So

1314
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:33,311
If you're not if he's not even selling

1315
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:35,359
Then I think we all know that

1316
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:36,127
That means it

1317
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:36,895
It's it's over

1318
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:39,199
Right you still selling

1319
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:41,759
Yeah but listen to

1320
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:44,575
Yeah he's not himself I don't know

1321
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:48,671
I know that he was in studio on Tuesday on the 21st I know that

1322
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:50,719
So we will still have some

1323
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:54,815
Thread to follow for the end of the week but

1324
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:56,863
I don't know man I'm excited

1325
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:59,935
It's going to be gone from Al Pacino to Jack Lebanon like

1326
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:03,519
Like four months in a different movie

1327
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:05,567
Yeah

1328
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:06,847
It's a rollercoaster

1329
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:14,271
We'll see what happens I mean I'm curious to see if on Tuesday we think I was still thinks that the virus is fake I have no I
