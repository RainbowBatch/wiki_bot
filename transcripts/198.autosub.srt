The messages down the road

69
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,784
Paces the bracket off

70
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:12,160
It's not it's just it turns out that sometimes we don't have as much time to dilly-dally on the show

71
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,464
That's a duty calls

72
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,024
Today is

73
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,423
Travel episode

74
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,983
Friend we've never met but

75
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:32,383
Has gotten ahold of me and

76
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,759
Is 2011

77
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,063
Give any idea of the significance

78
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,599
Of July 22nd

79
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,391
2011

80
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:49,023
21 + 1 is 22 numerology

81
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,327
22

82
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,911
+ 1 is 21

83
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,983
* 2 is 20

84
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,031
So that's what it is

85
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:03,871
That's not what it is no it's not

86
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,407
Numbers without

87
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:11,807
Numerology I was just like look at numbers is nothing to do with

88
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:18,207
Today we have a very

89
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,487
Be horrifying it

90
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:26,143
Illustrative another Point here is a very uncharacteristic out-of-context dropped

91
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:26,911
From today's episode

92
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,591
Is that mean

93
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:40,735
Is that a colloquialism it's not and never heard anyone died

94
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:45,599
Employer Paul Joseph Watson to go Full Tilt Boogie on something

95
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:49,695
I'm actually given the circumstances I think that is very very tacky

96
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:52,767
So I guess we should do

97
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:55,327
Just go ahead and start the episode and then we can discuss

98
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,375
Why the date

99
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,143
If someone

100
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,167
Especially someone

101
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01,471
From Scandinavia

102
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:07,359
Would send.

103
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,807
.

104
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,327
Other damage

105
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:33,727
Miniatures office effectively

106
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:37,311
People trapped eyewitnesses total chaos

107
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,687
Right now I'm

108
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:50,879
Why does Europeans completely

109
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,183
Norway.

110
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,463
And nor has it ever been

111
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:59,071
Part of the narrative is already a little bit sausage

112
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:05,727
July 22nd 2011 is the day that Android

113
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,799
Rezac committed terrorist attacks in Western Europe

114
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,871
Series of terrorist attacks

115
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:17,759
Across across Norway

116
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:22,879
On July 22nd 2011 Anders Breivik killed 77 people into separate areas

117
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,439
Attacks in Norway representing the 5th Deadliest Terrorist

118
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,487
2Pac ever in Western Europe

119
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,815
At 1525 central European summer time which

120
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,583
Is 315

121
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,351
P.m.

122
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:36,191
He set off a car bomb outside

123
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,471
Their time

124
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,519
It would have been 8 a.m. OurTime

125
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,543
8:15

126
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,591
8:25 a.m. our time soon

127
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:47,711
Car Bomb outside a government building that housed the office of the Prime Minister of Norway

128
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:52,319
The balm uses intentionally very similar to the one used by Timothy McVeigh in Oklahoma City

129
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:55,391
Eight people were killed in 209 were in

130
00:07:56,415 --> 00:08:01,023
Approximately 90 minutes later brevik arrived at the Norwegian Labour party's Youth League camp

131
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,303
A island

132
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,863
Having taken a fairy there while disguised as a police officer

133
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,423
Rather quickly killed the camp director in

00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:10,495
Security officer and our to terrorize

135
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,519
Is the people on the island

136
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,799
Before emergency service

137
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,567
It could arrive

138
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:20,223
No hablo police were alerted two minutes after the first shot their response time was greatly increased by the fact that they did not have a police helicopter

139
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,015
Copter which could have taken them directly

140
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:22,783
Liberty Island

141
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:27,903
Twice during his Rampage brother called the police and tried to surrender but ended up hanging up both times

142
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,207
It appears that he was toying with the police because he

143
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:32,767
Continue killing people in between the calls and after

144
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,583
Campers attempted to escape by swimming off the island

145
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,447
But a number of them were shot in the Water by Brad you will die today Marxist

146
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:44,287
By the time the police arrived you killed 69 people

147
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,847
50 of whom were 18 years of age or younger

148
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,127
It injured 100

149
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,175
When the police arrived

150
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,479
Reddit dropped his weapons and immediately surrender

151
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:56,831
When the police arrived the Tariff like a big baked the officers not to kill the

152
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,367
Since the original attack

153
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,391
Be carried out by someone

154
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,159
Policeman

155
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:05,791
Initially there were reports of an accomplice being arrested because the police wrongly arrested

156
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,327
Answered uko

157
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,863
A seventeen-year-old victim

158
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,703
The rationale was that his haircut with different than it was on his ID

159
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,031
And they felt that his response to the attack was different than the rest of the people there

160
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,591
He didn't cry or freaked out because as a child

161
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,639
He'd witnessed the massacre is in chechnya

162
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,175
And likely had some form of peace

163
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,479
Ptsb

164
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:30,879
Right arrested him and reports before circling and Alex is going to get into that the idea that they were most

165
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,439
Bullshooters which is based on this false arrest

166
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,463
Please put out

167
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,095
Hours later but still

168
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,423
Dicey

169
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,215
Fox

170
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,495
Yeah yeah

171
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:50,079
Immediately confessed to the bombing and shooting

172
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:53,663
Refuse to accept that he was wrong to do what he had done calling it necessary

173
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:58,015
Though initially deemed criminally insane a follow-up report by psychologist

174
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,295
Declared insane

175
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,319
He was tried and sent to

176
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,879
Sentenced to 21 years in prison

177
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:06,719
Good news about that is 12 sentences up they can just indefinitely extend it

178
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,487
Forever

179
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:13,887
The legal system barely works in Norway years for like terrorism

180
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,911
Murder is

181
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,679
The highest

182
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,311
And then opportunities

183
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:25,663
Yeah yeah yeah

184
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,199
But the we can only do that too

185
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,479
Today

186
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:34,623
Clearly and with conviction about how he did what he did was not wrong

187
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,391
Sense of remorse

188
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:39,487
He declared himself a modern-day Knight

189
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,047
I was resisting the invading

190
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:42,815
Muslims

191
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,911
Braddock showed a complete lack of remorse make one apology

192
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,959
He apologized that he had not killed morphe

193
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:53,055
6 hours before the attack Braddock posted a video on YouTube

194
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:56,127
Including a picture of him and military uniform decorated

195
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,919
With many medals he earned

196
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:01,247
In fact he was deemed unfit for service and was never in the military

197
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,343
In the video he depicts Islam as a trojan horse coming to destroy Europe

198
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,135
If there's ever been a more

199
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:10,975
Case as a relates to right-wing racist terrorism I'm not sure I've ever seen

200
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,023
Every single aspect of brother

201
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,095
To be confirmed into the front companies established

202
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:19,423
That wouldn't raise suspicion when you bought masses of fertilizer to me

203
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,191
Make his bomb

204
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,823
After being sentenced Braddock offered to provide information about the other cells of his alleged terrorist Network

205
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,103
Zelda probably didn't

206
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:31,711
But his offer was rejected so I didn't completely impossible demands he was making

207
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:34,783
Indicating that he quotes doesn't know how Society works

208
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:40,415
It turns out he offered the information on the condition that Norwegian and European societies be overthrown

209
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:43,487
In 2013 he threatened to go on a hunger strike

210
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,023
The prison to not give him a PlayStation

211
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,071
Is PlayStation 2

212
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,119
Because a PlayStation 3 had better games

213
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:55,519
2014 threatened that he would starve himself to death if we refused quote access to a sofa and a bigger gym

214
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,847
And again complained about the selection of video games he was provide

215
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:05,503
He complained in court that he was beginning to enjoy the reality show Paradise Hotel would be claimed as proof that he'd become brain

216
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,831
Honestly his life in prison sounds a little bit better than

217
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:13,183
Text 8:25 a.m.

218
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:16,767
The police arrived at utoya Island at 11:25 Austin time

219
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,815
Hayward Point brother can mediately surrender

220
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,607
Alex's show start

221
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,887
At 11 a.m. Austin

222
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,935
And concludes at 3 p.m.

223
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,959
There's no reason

224
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,495
For him not to know a good deal

225
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,263
Information

226
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,287
About what happen

227
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,079
Because a lot of disinformation

228
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,615
While there were

229
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,663
Misreporting in terms of that

230
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,199
Second possible shooter

231
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,479
A lot of these.

232
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,295
Had already happened by the time he got on air

233
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,831
A lot of it was unfolding

234
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,367
MVA Osso

235
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,391
We should

236
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,695
Hold him to a higher standard

237
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,719
Speculation

238
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:47,743
On this episode

239
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:51,839
So that is what happened on July 22nd 2000

240
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:55,423
And now we shall see how Alex covers this

241
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:58,495
And then I have a whole bunch more information coming up later

242
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,775
From some really

243
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:06,175
Really dark research that I ended up having to do for this episode

244
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,575
To imagine that this act is not

245
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,111
Terrorism done by whites

246
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,927
Possibly

247
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:20,767
Validation of every criticism that ever been levied against Alex

248
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,727
Just in terms of Alex's journalistic

249
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,007
Integrity

250
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,287
I'm terms of

251
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:35,615
Parallels that will be able to draw it

252
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,687
Clearlake I don't think this

253
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:47,391
Is bad because you trying to defend a white supremacist doesn't know what's going on

254
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:53,279
He's just creating a narrative that states what he talks about as opposed to being like

255
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:58,143
You'll see as it goes along.

256
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,423
Supremacist Mazzy learn

257
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,447
More about

258
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,007
Undoubtedly

259
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:09,407
Through the day off make it look like crazy

260
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:12,223
Doing the whole thing yeah and on this episode he does

261
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:16,575
He doesn't get back on but multiple times as we need Steve

262
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,367
Yeah I'm sure by Sunday

263
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:22,719
You got a chance and then they get the narrative that they need

264
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:23,743
Moving

265
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:30,655
Detail but I'm reading but I feel like it's important to know exactly the situation

266
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,679
That we have on our hands

267
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:34,751
77 people were killed by Duran

268
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,519
Man

269
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:39,359
Who hated Islam and hated liberalism and multiculturalism

270
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,711
Looking into how I'm very certain

271
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,991
About what he was doing

272
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,015
A little bit later

273
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,039
You don't

274
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:47,807
That

275
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:51,647
I am so

276
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:56,511
And pro prison conditions like in Oslo they have

277
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:01,119
Prison conditions that are

278
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:04,191
They have better living situation

279
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:08,543
Somewhat somewhat right in some in some respects

280
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,847
He's kept in like solitary

281
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,127
Confinement

282
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,151
Because

283
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:13,919
They don't want to

284
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:17,759
Set up a cell in prison something like that

285
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:20,319
Concerned considering he's one of the worst terrorist ever

286
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,599
Aunt clearly

287
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,415
I'll get to why I know this

288
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:27,231
Down the line planning this for

289
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,303
At least since 2002

290
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:36,703
End up getting into a prison population and probably

291
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,495
Hooking up with people and trying to

292
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:41,311
You get some for sure going

293
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:44,383
We've kept in solitary confinement but because solitary

294
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,175
Confined it meant is so cruel

295
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,319
Commission I believe

296
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,343
Accommodate the fact that they

297
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:58,719
They can't allow him to be around other people is that they have three cells

298
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,999
One is like a study

299
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:06,399
Video has one is like sleeping cell and he has allowed to play games

300
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:09,471
Amazon has an electric typewriter for a while

301
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:12,543
Computer but we know not allowed to be hooked up to the Internet

302
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,639
Accommodations I understand

303
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:21,759
You never even the worst people in the world you don't want them just rotting in a hole

304
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:28,159
More about us not deserve

305
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:35,071
I would never want him to be kept in solitary confinement I don't want him to be tortured

306
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,607
At the same time

307
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,631
He should be killed

308
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,471
He's like like that should be the situation

309
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:47,103
Write like a prison conditions

310
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:50,687
Absolutely I think because we had a chance to surrender witchy

311
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,967
I don't know if you deserve

312
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:52,735
I don't know

313
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:57,599
Like a horse that he did lay down his weapons

314
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,391
You can't then kill him

315
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:03,999
You know I don't I don't

316
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:10,399
Timestamp

317
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,167
Eva love like

318
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:17,311
No I don't want to torture you but also you can't be around anymore

319
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,335
Right you'd hope

320
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,383
I mean you'd wish that maybe we had like

321
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,151
Penal colony

322
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,943
Nothing like that

323
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,135
I don't know man it's it's very difficult

324
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:31,903
You know you

325
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:36,511
Your visceral reaction obviously is that like no punishment

326
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,047
Including a PlayStation

327
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,071
3 is good enough

328
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,167
It you preserve much worse than

329
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,959
At what at what point

330
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,519
Do we are we comfortable

331
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:48,799
Arbitrary

332
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,871
Much more severe punishment

333
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,183
Would rather he was just

334
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:05,951
Like

335
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,231
No longer with us

336
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:07,999
Lights

337
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:12,095
I don't want it I don't want him to experience internal pain or anything like that

338
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:18,495
It's because there is no God or Hell or anything like that but it should just be like a severing of your ability to be human

339
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:23,615
Any longer

340
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,151
Keisha Keisha

341
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,687
Yeah like that's what should happen

342
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:33,599
You shouldn't be allowed for all of those people

343
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:36,671
Which honestly I'm not sure you'd be able to avoid no matter what

344
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:39,487
You do

345
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:45,887
Do the Martyr as a political prisoner later.

346
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:50,239
You don't get to you don't get ticket status

347
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,263
Guitar

348
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,567
But he does complain that he only gets like

349
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:59,455
Childish game that doesn't get like modern warfare

350
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:04,319
It's so bizarre I don't know man I agree with you on a visceral human level

351
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,599
But I also like

352
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,391
I don't want to wrestle with those issues

353
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:11,487
I don't think I'm equipped to and I don't know the right answer

354
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,047
Philosophically opposed

355
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:15,839
Capital punishment

356
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,631
As a my butt

357
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:24,031
I also have no vested interest in telling the state of Norway how they can and can't meet out there Justice

358
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:34,271
Improved overall episode

359
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:38,367
Layout what is initial thoughts

360
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,135
This attack

361
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:41,951
I apologize that I stumbled up VI

362
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:46,815
The time differences and stuff like that at the beginning

363
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:49,375
I'm at 8:25 a.m.

364
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,935
Austin time Central Standard Time

365
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:54,495
Alex Goes On Air at 11

366
00:19:55,263 --> 00:20:01,407
Everything was over by 11:25 I was I was really confused as to why you made it a point to

367
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,943
Forget the time

368
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,223
Down and then once

369
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,503
You put it once you put it

370
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,271
Together as like

371
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:08,063
Of course that's an important thing

372
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:13,695
You should 8.00 broke out while he was at 2 and a half hours

373
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,719
Before the show

374
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,743
Of like

375
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,303
Get your information together

376
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,863
Get on air

377
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,887
It makes it worse

378
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:25,471
This is where he goes

379
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:29,311
Stupid in that they'll at least tell you though the white narrative that you wanted

380
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:34,687
Start thing

381
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,039
Bombings

382
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,999
Collapse

383
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:57,471
Tell you what's going to happen

384
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:01,055
Criminology

385
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,847
Good luck

386
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:07,199
I told you last year.

387
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:23,328
So is the media reaction like this is minutes after the show start

388
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,680
That you know that this is a false flag

389
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:31,520
This is the government Bankers changing something to get you

390
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:34,336
To stop thinking about the idea that a lot of Europe

391
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,616
Punic on Emmy's are in trouble

392
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,640
Yeah right now

393
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:41,504
I would say that's irresponsible

394
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:45,088
I believe he already started in the first clip

395
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,624
Was used to eat

396
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,904
Compare it to Oklahoma City

397
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:51,232
He's doing a lot of like

398
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:57,120
Yeah he's trying to Anchor that connection in people

399
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:57,888
2

400
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,984
Associate unrelated things to this

401
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,800
To further his argument

402
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:05,824
Which is baseless

403
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,640
That

404
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:20,416
I don't know

405
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,488
Patient

406
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:29,888
I think you hate me Coronavirus

407
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,680
I love

408
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:37,056
So much right now

409
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:39,104
To get this episode together was

410
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,128
One of them

411
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:40,896
Most

412
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:45,760
66

413
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:49,856
I do like digging into stop it I like having a topic

414
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:52,160
Learn about and understand

415
00:22:55,488 --> 00:23:01,632
Specifically

416
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:08,032
In the morning Linda Thompson

417
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:11,360
Was it was a Tuesday

418
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:17,760
I guess but I can weather it I guess

419
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,784
Yes there's something

420
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,832
Not great about myself but

421
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:23,136
Or good I don't know what it is

422
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:27,488
Belong to cover

423
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,280
And I don't want to

424
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,048
Necessarily

425
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,776
Predictions that he has and I would say that all of them are not

426
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:58,976
He knows nothing about oslo's prison system went to prison is like tried to sue the government

427
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:01,280
For violating human rights

428
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:05,376
In terms of its first case and then was overturned

429
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,936
Court over upheld

430
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:12,288
The appeal so they're like no we didn't

431
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,056
F*** that guy

432
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:16,128
PlayStation 3

433
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,784
F*** you a bunch of periodically about various

434
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:23,808
Steve Maynard like

435
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,160
I will save it from my research I knows it before the attack

436
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,184
He was very again

437
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:31,232
I use against

438
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,768
Hitler and the National Socialist

439
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,304
Because he believed that they

440
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,840
Got the wrong guys

441
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:40,192
No because disservice to the Germanic White

442
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:40,960
Because they

443
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:43,520
Created through their foolhardy

444
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:46,336
Israel Israel

445
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:52,736
He's not against Israel either

446
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:56,576
Straight talk to nail down and I'll do my best in all of it in due time

447
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:58,368
But he's against Hitler in the

448
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,136
Knox

449
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,672
Before the attack because

450
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:07,072
If they happen to try to do this genocide

451
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:10,656
F*** you man

452
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,448
Gee thanks

453
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,728
Because of their action

454
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:14,496
The blowback

455
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,848
Created the multiculturalism and the political correct

456
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,384
That he is so again

457
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,688
So he doesn't hate Hitler for the reasons

458
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,736
You should he hate them because

459
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,272
The aftermath of it

460
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:31,392
Has created the world that we live in today where there's a plurality of people's rights

461
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:34,720
People should be able to live

462
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:35,488
Together

463
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:38,048
And please so he's kind of more like a

464
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,352
I like those white nationalism

465
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:51,360
Yeah

466
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,432
It's tough to unpack if you hate

467
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,456
Bike

468
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,736
Chinese or black

469
00:25:56,992 --> 00:26:00,064
People

470
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,416
Probably a lot of bigotry underneath

471
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,208
But the more you dig into him

472
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,256
Read things the people who knew him

473
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,792
Before would say like

474
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,840
Past co-workers

475
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,984
There's a thread of like he was a really good worker he's very competent

476
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,336
But he would really get bothered and annoyed by Pakistani people dating

477
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:25,408
And stuff like that

478
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,736
I didn't like just anytime Muslims would come up you get mad

479
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:34,112
And stuff like that crawl

480
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,648
About those Pacific

481
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,440
Xbox

482
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,256
Go to

483
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:46,912
My point of pausing this clip is just to say Alex's prediction of it being a drug.

484
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,192
Do not receive

485
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:51,776
Ezz clear-eyed

486
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,312
F******

487
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,080
Terrorist

488
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:56,128
Murderer

489
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:59,200
To the effect of I apologize I didn't kill more people

490
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:01,248
He's a psychopath

491
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:14,048
Adamantine Steel

492
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:18,400
It's not native adamantium

493
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:27,616
Help

494
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:31,712
Total chaos

495
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:37,344
So Alex is going out on a limb and saying this is Muslim terrorists and they were abetted by the government

496
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,416
I'm probably blew themselves up in the car all of you

497
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:41,952
Completely wrong

498
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:45,280
All of a sudden getting on air immediately and creating a narrative

499
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,304
Irresponsible

500
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,888
And based on nothing other than his quote on quote gut

501
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,424
Or whatever

502
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:54,752
His deep research that he does like every time

503
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:55,776
Like that

504
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,824
And it's not it's absolutely not it's

505
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,872
Like right now today

506
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:03,200
We are in a situation where in 2018

507
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:07,296
Recording is on Sunday there was a mass shooting this morning

508
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:11,136
Yep in the same way that we don't have all the details while we're recording this

509
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,672
You'll be responsible for us

510
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:13,952
To decide

511
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,256
And create some sort of a storyline out of that

512
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:20,096
Rack-O if we were they all look at this another way

513
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:26,496
Whether or not that is the truth that comes out we don't know that while we're recording this

514
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,312
Who made listen to us

515
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:33,152
So he's doing that about this and it's

516
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,432
Disgraceful

517
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:35,712
It's real gross

518
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:42,112
For some reason

519
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,696
We deal with his wife

520
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,464
Soupremacy

521
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,232
All the time

522
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:51,584
Deal with all of his s*** all the time but anytime he

523
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,656
He minimizes tragedy

524
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:55,936
The way that he

525
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,240
He does like after any of these Mash

526
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:01,824
People die

527
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,128
And he turns them into props

528
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,176
That are that might as well be f******

529
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:09,248
Mannequins

530
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:15,648
Isn't even worse now that you know

531
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:16,672
This is just such a

532
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,696
F****** punched

533
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:23,584
God yeah I'm sorry to bring this into your life but by the time we get to the end of this you'll understand

534
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,864
Much more fully

535
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,632
Why I think

536
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,704
As much as I

537
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,288
Learn about this year about that

538
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:35,360
I'm overwhelmed by how much I appreciate

539
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:37,152
Pointing Us in this direction

540
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:40,224
What happened because I think that we can

541
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:40,992
Can highlight

542
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,016
Something that is

543
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,320
Very demonstrative

544
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,088
Big

545
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,880
Big problem about Alex Jones

546
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,672
That I think that we have

547
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,560
Necessarily

548
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:57,120
Dealt with in the way that we shouldn't we're going to

549
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:57,888
Over the course of the

550
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:58,912
15

551
00:29:59,168 --> 00:29:59,680
Pictures of

552
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:03,008
We talked about his b******* regarding

553
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,032
Hook all the

554
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:06,592
Big f******

555
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,152
So much worse

556
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:16,064
Nail right on the head that he seems to enjoy this

557
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:22,464
Like at the beginning of the episode the first clip we played he was talking about the shooting in the

558
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,072
With kind of like almost excitement about it do you like there

559
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:30,656
Yeah he's doing like a announcer revoiced

560
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:34,240
And that continues into this next clip I really think he's relishing

561
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:37,056
The fact there's some sort of tragedy

562
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:42,176
You know about that

563
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:46,528
Explosion went off in Oslo Norway

564
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:53,440
Housing Ministry

565
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,720
Call Mom

566
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:07,008
Looks like Oklahoma City

567
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,616
Eyewitness reports

568
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:14,176
She's doing that voice with

569
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:17,248
Almost

570
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:20,576
At lead this is bleeding this is going to leave that kind of thing

571
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,368
Which is gross and then

572
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,648
Bring up Oklahoma City

573
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:29,024
The idea that there was a

574
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:35,424
Make these make

575
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:38,496
Knew about Oklahoma City

576
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:41,568
And was third in terms of planning

577
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:47,456
By what Timothy McVeigh did and he was frustrated by the fact that you done it because

578
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:53,856
To get the bomb supplies that you need in order to

579
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:57,696
Fertilizer let's make sure we keep track of this for no reason

580
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:00,000
Zoe lamented the idea that

581
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:10,240
Yep god dammit

582
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:17,152
Girl

583
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:23,296
Alright so

584
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,064
The false flag

585
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:30,464
About whether or not this is a real thing

586
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:33,024
Children

587
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:43,520
Write about the Muslim

588
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:48,384
When the total collapse

589
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:15,520
Research right now

590
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,568
Norway

591
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,408
This individual

592
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,736
Rosler wasn't a country

593
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:37,280
But with the timer

594
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,960
I would check your percent

595
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,520
Percent chance this is real

596
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:52,640
So Alex's is correct is accurately read

597
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,408
From reports

598
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:56,224
That it was probably

599
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:58,528
Target prime minister

600
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:00,064
And the reason is because

601
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:06,464
You deem him a supporter of multiculturalism and someone who is unacceptable and a

602
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,024
Three classifications of

603
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,328
Traders class

604
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:15,936
BMW presidents or prime minister

605
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,472
But that was

606
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:20,288
Additionally utoya Island

607
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:25,152
From the Labour party which party that

608
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:26,432
Supported multiculturalism

609
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:30,016
And also a former politician

610
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,576
One of the big

611
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:35,648
Supporters of multiculturalism in Norway

612
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,952
Was scheduled to give a speech there

613
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,232
And she did go give us

614
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:45,376
Speech therapy but it already left by the time because he got caught in traffic and s*** on the way over to the island

615
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,912
So the idea that

616
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,192
Like Alex

617
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:50,240
Kind of Remy wrong about the globalist

618
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,008
Doing this

619
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:54,080
Absolutely was targeting these people

620
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:59,456
For the reason of killing and taking out the political security

621
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,224
Tubi

622
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,504
Supporters

623
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:04,064
Plurality

624
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:04,832
Culture

625
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:05,600
Religion

626
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,624
All those things

627
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,928
He thought was going to destroy Europe

628
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,512
So

629
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,072
Yeah

630
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:16,608
White

631
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,656
Come on let's let's

632
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:19,936
And let's get out of here

633
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:30,688
I know.

634
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:37,344
What is all on a f****** Arc blow it up after through the Journey has taken on

635
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,416
Like a slightly different meaning in the last day

636
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,816
Just relax

637
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:53,216
List

638
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:59,360
More seriously that don't directly involve

639
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,384
Cuz it does

640
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:02,176
This absolutely does

641
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:02,944
Like

642
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:11,904
Because I always do babe

643
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,952
Committed these crimes

644
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,256
But I didn't understand

645
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,536
The full picture of it

646
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:23,680
I think you did a really terrible job of explaining what you was about

647
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:25,984
And really looking at the full picture

648
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,264
Because you know

649
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:33,408
I think that there is a

650
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:37,248
Face the music

651
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:42,112
He was inspired by what his goals were what

652
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:44,416
The people who were

653
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:46,464
Philosophically aligned

654
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,512
Things like that I think you have

655
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,304
You have to deal with

656
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,120
What are commonalities of rhetoric

657
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:59,008
Is it safe to say

658
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:05,408
That he is a logical extension of that rhetoric you know what I mean like I really have to wrestle with issues like that

659
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,688
And it's not fun to do

660
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:08,736
It's really really not fun to do

661
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:10,272
Especially at 3:30 in the morning

662
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:17,952
Oh no

663
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:20,256
Hammer it home but was this guy

664
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:23,328
Who is inspired by that one dude in like the late

665
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:24,096
70s

666
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:30,496
Another guy more recently who was a huge fan of this guy who is like a

667
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:33,312
Political on the right

668
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,920
He was mostly inspired

669
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:39,456
In terms of his orange

670
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,272
Okay

671
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:48,160
Cut the balls

672
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:52,512
Put out a Manifesto

673
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:02,496
I will get into all that

674
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:04,544
Are you the one

675
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:10,944
Cartoon suck

676
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:16,064
You didn't force my hand at all it was more that I recognized that I kept

677
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:21,696
I feel like I'm teasing in a way that's inappropriate

678
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:23,232
I should just tell you

679
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,512
A lot of

680
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:27,328
A lot of questions

681
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:30,400
Jimmy Lee Curtis

682
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:32,960
True life

683
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:39,360
Walmart

684
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:41,152
Anyway

685
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,528
I celebrate his catalog

686
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:53,184
I swear to God it is still in the wrong

687
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:53,952
It's so good

688
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:57,792
One of the few movies my parents love you don't know why

689
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,584
I think we left the book

690
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:07,264
Nr2003 primary

691
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:10,080
Find out when Alex Jones

692
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:11,872
Started talking about George Soros

693
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,968
So far as we've got through 2019

694
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:21,088
There was one

695
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,112
Read that it was

696
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,648
2014 Alex

697
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,440
Would have jumped on the Soros bandwagon

698
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:26,464
Because

699
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,744
Involvement

700
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,768
Against

701
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:30,816
And Ukraine

702
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:34,912
Right he was a force trying to open societies up

703
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:37,728
The encroachment of Russian

704
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:43,616
Influenza virus member correctly there like there was something to do with his son being specifically targeted

705
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:47,456
Ya-ya-ya Alex

706
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:49,248
Before that we're going like party in Russia

707
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:55,392
Working Theory

708
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:58,208
I didn't think that was necessarily the case but it was open

709
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:59,232
For a possibility

710
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:04,096
I'm and because of his next life we now know it was at least before 2011

711
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,472
Because the bar

712
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:15,104
You could look for a

713
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,920
Criminal investigation

714
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:19,200
George Soros

715
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,480
Justice

716
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:21,248
Apartments

717
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,136
Investigating

718
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:33,024
This is ridiculous

719
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,288
Outpost

720
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,384
Adjust

721

Thesaurus

722
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:51,968
So this is about the news course

723
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:59,136
Cirrhosis investigation into bread

724
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:05,536
Also an issue of the vertigo

725
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:07,840
Lucifer which is a spin-off

726
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:12,448
DW wrestler

727
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:18,848
I just had to get our mandatory wrestling reference alphabox for today

728
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:23,968
Around a little bit

729
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:25,248
About Anders Breivik

730
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:27,552
Or even know the name or anything

731
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:33,952
About the doorway situation and ask her to dance is authentic

732
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,488
Topix

733
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,304
He wants to fully reinforce his narrative

734
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:40,352
A complaining about Soros getting

735
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:44,192
His fingers in pies of Investigation whether or not.

736
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,472
True I have no idea

737
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:47,264
He gets right back

738
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,032
You calling this

739
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:59,295
After

740
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:11,327
Doctor's office

741
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:14,143
Massive

742
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:16,703
Eyewitnesses total chaos

743
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:21,055
Music reading that exact same anything past that headline

744
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:25,919
You heard him read it like four times already

745
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:26,943
On the

746
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:27,967
Rollo Carol

747
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:33,087
A mockery of a

748
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:38,975
Just to remind you

749
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,095
It's a banker

750
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:46,143
Also you can find plenty of insta

751
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:46,911
Sentence of Terror

752
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:48,959
Attacks

753
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:54,079
And stuff like that if you want it if you want to save it like

754
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:55,615
You can you can

755
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,639
Point out of

756
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:58,943
Few times that there have been countries

757
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:00,223
Is in financial trouble

758
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:02,015
Terrorist attacks have happened

759
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:05,343
That is at best a

760
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,391
You need to do better than

761
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:09,951
Even further

762
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:12,255
If you are in finance

763
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:16,095
He'll travel and you see that there is a ruling class that does not

764
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,375
Share within that Finance

765
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:18,143
Cancel travel

766
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:21,983
It is much more likely that you're completely

767
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,519
Complete destruction of your life

768
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:25,567
Woodley tour they and idea

769
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:28,127
Well what have I got to lose there's a desperation

770
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:31,199
Kind of explain

771
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:36,831
But that's not

772
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:38,111
Hate hate

773
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:41,951
Here's another Alex Jones wants more statistic

774
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:42,719
Pixabay

775
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:49,887
0% of 5

776
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:53,727
100% Obama committed by brown people are Muslim attacks

777
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:55,519
Dentistry

778
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:56,287
Statistics

779
00:43:56,543 --> 00:44:01,151
Still thinks it's Muslim

780
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:05,503
Funded by Stephen then the Muslims are false

781
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:08,063
You should know by now cuz I believe report that already

782
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:11,135
Come out

783
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:13,439
Any will

784
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:15,231
He still thinks it's Al-Qaeda

785
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,511
Or something like that

786
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:18,303
Here's a stat

787
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:19,327
Again

788
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:25,727
But I cannot

789
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,775
I cannot state

790
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:30,847
Any more clearly to all of you out there

791
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:35,967
Just

792
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:43,391
There have been bombings in Europe because

793
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:46,207
Nine times out of 10 or more

794
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:51,071
These bombings in Europe and the United States are completely

795
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,863
100

796
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:57,471
Yikes

797
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:03,103
Everything is globalist

798
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:05,407
Trying to

799
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:11,551
You know what he does a really smart thing he lost track of a little bit later and it's

800
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:14,623
100%

801
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,903
Yeah but

802
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:19,487
You catching his language in a really smart way that makes it

803
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:20,767
Incase

804
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:22,303
I get in trouble for this

805
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:27,423
All I said is 98%

806
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:32,799
You make your own conclusions from their absolute

807
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:33,823
But

808
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:37,151
He has it in the same way when he says I'm going to kill you politically

809
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:44,575
All steaks are off I'm not saying s*** it doesn't mean anything there's no consequence

810
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:46,879
Behaving this way

811
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:48,671
Saying this is fake

812
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:50,207
But I am also in

813
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:51,999
Flying that it might

814
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:53,023
Not be fake

815
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:54,815
But I'm telling you to

816
00:45:55,071 --> 00:46:00,191
Air on the side of this is fake and definitely if somebody tells you otherwise

817
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:06,591
Where was the 98 % sure they're lying to you exactly

818
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,175
Hosta tistic Lee

819
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:13,503
They're most likely lying to you about it

820
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:19,135
So even if it is real you'll never be able to believe them that it's not real because you're

821
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:20,159
Crazy because I

822
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:26,047
I think you did a thorough breakdown of that that line of thinking there

823
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:27,839
Reno

824
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,119
In 2018

825
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:32,959
Alex Jones SNL real includes his

826
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:34,239
Chris Cuomo impression

827
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:37,567
His impression of George Soros life

828
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:42,431
Of course

829
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:45,759
For us to find out

830
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:47,551
Kind of like Bernie

831
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:48,319
2011

832
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,135
No

833
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:53,183
Here's a clip

834
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:57,279
Bernie Sanders has released the FED audit

835
00:46:57,535 --> 00:47:00,351
A partial Auto confirming 16 trillion

836
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:01,631
In secret

837
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:09,567
60

838
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:13,151
Dollars that's not a real amount of money

839
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:16,735
This is what the

840
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:18,271
They're getting paid off

841
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:29,791
So he has like a

842
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:32,607
He was the most popular politician

843
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:36,959
Yeah perhaps

844
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:42,335
Weather for today

845
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:48,735
Do that

846
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:54,111
Was a huge fan of Bernie's at the time he is towards somebody now

847
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:55,903
The more likely it is that in

848
00:47:56,159 --> 00:48:02,303
There's a 98%

849
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:08,191
Everything that he believed was upside down

850
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:11,007
What's an exception of like Rand Ron Paul

851
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,055
But that's just because they

852
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:14,079
Right right

853
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:15,871
Roberto Cavalli specific

854
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:19,199
Seems like they got a pass and I think a lot of that

855
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:22,271
To do with Ron Paul's newsletter

856
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:31,231
So somehow I really want to know how he felt about Ross Perot right now

857
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:36,607
Just text right he loved there's no way we can

858
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:43,007
Call in Roxboro

859
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:44,031
Threatened

860
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:50,431
I remember that ended up leaving the election

861
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:52,735
Was going to actually pick me up

862
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:58,879
Accidentally

863
00:48:59,391 --> 00:48:59,903
You do it

864
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:05,023
Is that Bernie Sanders you know what you know what's going on

865
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:09,375
From my childhood watching like SNL sketches

866
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:11,679
I don't f****** really know if I know that

867
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:18,335
It's between Dana Carvey impressions

868
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:24,735
I know that they're different I'm not sure I agree with you

869
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:26,271
I agree with you

870
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:29,599
Bill Clinton is Bill Clinton

871
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:30,879
More than Bill Clinton

872
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:32,927
Best of all of those though is that

873
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:37,535
Norm Macdonald Bob Dole

874
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:41,375
Until this year when you have at a minute

875
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:43,935
Adomian

876
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:52,895
Forms of political impressions

877
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,967
Alex

878
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:59,807
He still off the the doorway situation

879
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:07,743
I'm looking at actually you are

880
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:18,239
In preparation

881
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:21,055
Where what's going on

882
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:22,079
That's all

883
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:30,015
Partially reversed

884
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:36,159
They're going to be

885
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:38,207
Of the next solution in

886
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,351
We're not allowed to use the word up

887
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:49,471
Oh whoops

888
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:54,335
First question

889
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,359
Second question

890
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:57,919
What kind of Fortress are we talking like

891
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:02,527
14th century Irish Castle are we talking

892
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:03,807
Sheridan

893
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:07,647
Alright assume something along those lines.

894
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:08,415
The South

895
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:12,255
England tradition

896
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,279
Situation where I am

897
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:15,071
Truly genuinely races

898
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,119
I don't like the Welsh

899
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,911
I just don't like the Welsh

900
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:22,751
Probably not

901
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:29,151
No - 101.4 your bigotry

902
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:35,551
I'm going to build fortresses

903
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:36,575
And that it's fun

904
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:38,879
Like you're building a pillow Fortress

905
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:45,023
Also

906
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:48,607
The floor is lava

907
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:51,423
Your plan

908
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:52,959
No exam

909
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:58,079
I just think that's fun and demonstrates a sort of state of mine

910
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:59,359
Very serious paranoia

911
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:05,759
Differently

912
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:10,111
Because our recent episode we found from presentation

913
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:19,071
Which is Hill killing a dude

914
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:25,215
And that of course is going to come into play of how I cure various clips about his past violence

915
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:29,311
To go back and start all over again

916
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:33,919
2711

917
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:38,527
Secret 2017 probably much worse now

918
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:41,599
So I am now here

919
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:42,623
Clip and I think

920
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:45,183
He might have killed a couple of guys

921
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:54,911
Going to rape your wife

922
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:58,495
He has a right to do it

923
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:03,103
I agree

924
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:10,527
Going to Dallas

925
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:18,463
Weighted grab-assing away and well

926
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:31,519
Fun

927
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:32,799
He left

928
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:39,199
Dallas and Rockwall and move to Austin and his sophomore year of high school so he would have been 15/16

929
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:43,295
Police report

930
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:45,343
That are closed because he was a minor

931
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:51,743
Those aren't accessible to public searches

932
00:53:58,399 --> 00:54:00,703
Yeah and it's not anywhere

933
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:11,199
Internal database

934
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:17,855
I don't I don't want them to do that play anybody

935
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:21,183
I don't want anybody to do that cuz I believe in the

936
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:22,975
Do you like me

937
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:26,047
Criminal

938
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:32,191
And not because I got arrested or anything like that really good part of society

939
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:33,471
Right terms of like

940
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:36,031
You know you get arrested for stealing something as a

941
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:38,079
Once you get older if you haven't

942
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:42,431
I'm committed more crime your writing wasn't

943
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:45,503
No I respect

944
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:51,903
As we know he is still a child so it's true

945
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:52,927
His record

946
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:54,719
Should either be expunged

947
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:56,511
Also like

948
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:58,815
I mean if you killed a dude in a street fight

949
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:00,863
Like that's different than like

950
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:02,399
Feeling or something like that

951
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:06,751
Respect the privacy of it

952
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:10,079
Nothing to be said for the idea of like what he's describing here is possible

953
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:10,847
Self-defense

954
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:14,943
If he did get into a fight with someone who had a knife any

955
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:19,295
Right I don't think that

956
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:25,439
Although also Alex Jones is an unreliable narrator

957
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:27,999
Question

958
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:33,631
Once again to hammer this point home how do you think he would have been tried

959
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:35,679
Where he's not awake

960
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:52,575
That's true I apologize I'm sure Jerry Jones

961
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:56,159
I just that was my impression of him

962
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:59,487
I assume you said something like that in the Cowboys locker room I'm not sure

963
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:01,791
Anyway

964
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:02,815
It is next clip

965
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:07,423
Had previously

966
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:09,215
D2 there probably

967
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:10,495
It's important 2011

968
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:12,543
Before that

969
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:13,567
Publication

970
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:14,847
Some sort of

971
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:17,663
Indications that they believe that one

972
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:20,479
Things to be concerned about what's homegrown Terror

973
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:22,783
The idea of white people committing to

974
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:26,879
Folks to be on the lookout for

975
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:28,415
Good news

976
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:30,207
Was unfounded

977
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:39,167
Department of Homeland Security that but no thanks we won't be needing your services

978
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:43,263
So now Alex narrative

979
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:44,031
About Norway

980
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:45,311
Which is pretty

981
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:53,503
Breitbart

982
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:55,295
Fox News

983
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:59,135
Our story

984
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:02,207
Crown Vic

985
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:20,383
Fox News

986
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:21,919
As white Americans

987
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:35,231
Eagle 99.3

988
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:37,535
Call wife

989
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:39,839
Returning veterans

990
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:51,359
Does a real classified document

991
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:53,151
General

992
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:56,223
Also 100%

993
00:57:58,015 --> 00:57:58,783
Oh yeah okay

994
00:57:59,295 --> 00:57:59,807
Everyone drink

995
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:11,327
I've never laughed and I think we're a little shell-shocked on this episode

996
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:13,631
There's a lot of heaviness and desperately trying

997
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:20,031
2

998
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:21,055
Really shity

999
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:21,823
Sort of

1000
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:24,127
Misunderstanding of what the Department of Homeland

1001
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:26,175
Security was trying to express

1002
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:30,015
Also it's really funny on this episode where we now know

1003
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:32,063
That the terrorist attack

1004
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:34,367
Norway was carried out by

1005
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:36,415
Strictly

1006
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:40,255
Non multiculturalism views that inspired him

1007
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:42,559
Complaining about the United States be like

1008
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:45,375
We should be aware that this is

1009
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:51,775
This is a doorway

1010
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:55,615
Alright

1011
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:56,639
So now

1012
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:58,175
We get a gas

1013
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:58,943
Jordan

1014
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:02,527
I'm going to guest on the show Alex's pivoting away from the doorway talk

1015
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:03,807
Amanda

1016
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:05,855
Encounter

1017
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:06,623
In the past

1018
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:09,439
But she is someone who has a real fun

1019
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:11,231
Backstory for me to tell you

1020
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:23,775
And more

1021
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:27,615
Highway listening to her couple days ago

1022
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:29,919
45

1023
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:33,759
Drinking

1024
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:36,575
Investigative journalist

1025
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:42,719
Cool

1026
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:43,487
I

1027
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:45,023
No Janet Phelan

1028
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:46,815
Why do I know her name

1029
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:50,143
Mostly

1030
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:52,703
Is biological weapon

1031
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:55,519
She covers a lot

1032
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:59,359
She's written a number of books one of them is called Hitler's poem

1033
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:00,639
Which I tried book

1034
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:01,663
Could not find a synopsis

1035
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:03,967
If it's a positive

1036
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:05,503
Book about Hitler

1037
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:07,807
Book of poetry

1038
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:12,415
It could be I have no idea

1039
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:17,279
Just did it exist

1040
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:18,559
All limericks

1041
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:23,423
Hitler only wrote Limerick there once was a Hitler from Nantucket

1042
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:30,591
I'll give you a little bit information about Janet Phelan we'll see if any of those drugs or memory where you might know her

1043
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:33,919
Investigative journalist who largely

1044
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:35,455
Specialize in BIO weapon

1045
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:41,599
Reroute of arguing that the United States has consistently and wantonly violated biological and chemical weapons

1046
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:51,583
The research that the labs are doing

1047
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:53,631
What states are offensive or defensive

1048
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:56,447
But she provides nothing to suggest that they are in fact

1049
01:00:57,215 --> 01:01:00,287
There's an appeal to the RN argument is

1050
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:04,383
Both maybe but

1051
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:05,663
Is there is also

1052
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:09,247
You know those papers that come out their stories to come out to

1053
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:10,271
Explain the research

1054
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:11,039
Being done

1055
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:12,063
In terms of

1056
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:14,111
Creating virulent strains of thing

1057
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:15,391
Write one of the big reasons

1058
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:17,183
Defenses against

1059
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:21,535
Specific

1060
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:23,583
Self the question why is it that we have a pro

1061
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:24,351
Particularly

1062
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:27,935
Smallpox virus

1063
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:30,239
The help

1064
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:32,799
You know people who are fallible

1065
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:34,335
Great you know that kind of

1066
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:36,127
Because

1067
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:38,943
The idea that we aren't the only people who have

1068
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:40,479
Pictures of

1069
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:43,551
Destroyed

1070
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:46,111
The f****** world

1071
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:49,183
You try and come up with as many inoculations as many

1072
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:52,255
Cures that you can try and find ways around

1073
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:55,583
Becoming weaponize

1074
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:57,631
Bob's

1075
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:59,423
It's like nuclear weapon

1076
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:02,495
Nobody should have until nobody has them

1077
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:04,287
People should have

1078
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:05,567
At the same time

1079
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:09,151
You think it's naive to think that we're not doing anything on that front

1080
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:12,735
Uno's

1081
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:17,599
You get to just play a game with yourself

1082
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:19,391
And whatever you like to believe

1083
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:21,695
When you ask what is the primary

1084
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:22,463
Motivation

1085
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:28,607
Primary motivation

1086
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:30,655
Even then

1087
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:33,983
What person is doing the research

1088
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:37,055
Like we can't know the intentions

1089
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:39,359
Until we ask

1090
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:42,943
Meet a real mad scientist me like that's not good

1091
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:43,711
Right

1092
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:46,527
Behind her

1093
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:49,343
She writes for and released a book called exile

1094
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,879
Through a publication called

1095
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:52,159
New Eastern Outlook

1096
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:58,815
Politico describes new Eastern Outlook is a geo-political Journal published by a government

1097
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:01,631
And run it runs headlines like

Ku Klux Klan dados new Ally

As the United States confronted Russian Allied Bashar al-assad

1100
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:11,103
For using chemical weapons against Syrian children this spring

1101

And quote exclusive trip to Russia first

The Budapest Beacon New Eastern Outlook is known to be kremlin-backed a Russian propaganda

1105
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:27,999
Outlet targeting foreign audience

1106
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:30,815
An article in Sputnik with the headline quotes

Here's how Putin and healthy diet made Russian product

1108

In China

1109
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:37,727
Was based on an article from the new Eastern

Supreme

1114
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:57,439
I don't know forces behind new Eastern Outlook

1115
01:03:57,695 --> 01:03:58,975
How to fight Western propaganda

1116
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:03,071
Work

1117
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:05,119
It's essential to focus on emotion

He begins quote

1119
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:10,751
First they manufacture monstrous lies and then they tell us we should be

Andre goes on to ask

1124
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:25,599
Do we counter that

1125
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:28,927
Tactics and strategy of the destructive and ruthless Empire with our honesty

1126
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:29,695
Research

1127
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:30,463
Was telling

1128
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:32,767
Meticulously investigative back

1129
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:33,535
Yeah

1130
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:39,935
He does not directly answer the question

1131
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:43,519
Poetry emotionally-charged songs

1132
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:45,311
I've always been more effective than

1133
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:51,711
Academic studies all of them written by Hitler or political novels in film

1134
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:52,991
Cartoons and posters

1135
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:54,527
Someone

1136
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:58,623
Because they're lying should we lie as well no

1137
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:05,023
We should try to be as truthful as man we should try to be as truthful as we can

1138
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:07,839
But our message should often be a bridge

1139
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:09,119
So the billions

1140
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:10,399
Not just the selected

1141
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:11,679
If you can understand it

1142
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:17,055
With the SparkNotes of reality and he's leaning heavily towards not the real one

1143
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:19,103
She's one of the people behind

1144
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:20,639
To do Easter Network

1145
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:21,919
His article year

1146
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:23,967
Very clearly lays out like

1147
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:30,111
Yeah we should tell the truth truth

1148
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:32,671
M4 murkiness effect

1149
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:35,231
So

1150
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:38,047
People react

1151
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:43,167
More emotion

1152
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:50,591
Run the World

1153
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:52,895
Done

1154
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:54,431
Yeah but

1155
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:55,455
Guiding Prince

1156
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:56,479
Baseball for one of the people

1157
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:58,783
Who's in charge of the new year

1158
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:00,063
I think identikit

1159
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:02,367
To me that maybe they don't have a hard journalistic

1160
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:06,975
Editorial

1161
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:14,911
Knossos

1162
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:18,495
Location that she works released

1163
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:22,591
Foreign propaganda relationship

1164
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:25,919
Alright so then I'm assuming that means

1165
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:27,199
I can trust everything

1166
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:28,735
She says in the center

1167
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:29,759
Implicit

1168
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:36,159
Any higher order thinking at all.

1169
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:37,439
Respond as though everything

1170
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:38,975
She says

1171
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:40,511
Categorical

1172
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:41,535
Play that clip

1173
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:49,215
Ruckus most stuff like they can't possibly prove

1174
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:57,407
Four biological labs and stuff like that

1175
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:09,183
Color

1176
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:11,743
I was going through

1177
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:14,047
If we if we try and get into any of this

1178
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:15,327
Time-suck

1179
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:19,935
You can just sort of Pont

1180
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:21,727
I am just say like to level four

1181
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:25,055
Biological research

1182
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:42,719
You got a sense of what I'm talking about that

1183
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:43,999
Secretly level 2

1184
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:46,303
I think it has to do with like the level of Defense

1185
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:49,375
Surrounded like whether or not they have to be deep underground

1186
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:55,263
Multiple times

1187
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:58,335
Episode

1188
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:04,735
Does it mean you break out in mice

1189
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:08,831
No

1190
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:10,367
But I'm assuming because

1191
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:11,391
That's automatic

1192
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:13,439
His narrative

1193
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:19,839
It's an article and a headline in the New York Times that reads biotera researchers build a Morley

1194
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:20,607
Apple Mouse

1195
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:22,911
There's a f****** scary headline

1196
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:25,983
The article

1197
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:30,591
The article is about how researchers placed a single existing Mouse poxvirus

1198
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:32,127
That would make it super

1199
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:35,455
Preventive measures

1200
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:38,783
Because it's often I how we develop protection for humans

1201
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:42,367
The results show that the best defenses

1202
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:43,391
Quite effective

1203
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:46,719
And preventing deadly disease not only human

1204
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:48,767
Exposed to customize smallpox

1205
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:50,303
Of similar design

1206
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:52,095
It's like a really huge

1207
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:58,495
Benefit

1208
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:00,543
Against

1209
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:01,567
Spiders

1210
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:04,639
It's a one of the

1211
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:06,431
Who plays the other sort of

1212
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:13,087
Credit One

1213
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:17,439
Animals

1214
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:24,351
It's nearly invaluable the idea of having the protection there's no other way to designs

1215
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:26,143
Sound design in the viruses

1216
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:27,423
Yeah

1217
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:28,959
I think it's

1218
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:31,263
Not gross but I think it's scary

1219
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:35,359
The ideas about it and it's sort of weird to your thought processes like

1220
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:37,151
Their scientists sitting around

1221
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:39,455
Giving these animals horrible diseases

1222
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:45,855
You don't like that thanks New York Times for the clickbait as headline you could possibly make

1223
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:47,647
Instead of

1224
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:50,207
Still working to protect you

1225
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:53,279
Scared about the prospect of

1226
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:55,583
Diseases like smallpox getting out

1227
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:59,935
But from the article quote the leaders of the research said that the lethal Mouse virus would

1228
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:01,471
Have no effect on humans

1229
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:03,263
Even if it somehow escaped from the lab

1230
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:07,103
Which they said was safeguarded at biosafety level

1231
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:12,735
Gordon's hours

1232
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:13,759
With no address

1233
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:16,319
To my knowledge

1234
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:19,391
Suggest this kind of research poses any sort of human risk

1235
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:20,671
Said Mark Buller

1236
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:24,511
Professor of molecular micro microbiology Saint Louis University

1237
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:26,047
Who directed

1238
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:30,655
Research of prologue to all zombie movies

1239
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:34,239
Many experiments have shown the mass box does not cause disease in humans

1240
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:38,079
Experts said both the threat of such developments

1241
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:40,895
The federal Response Team part of the theoretical debates

1242
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:42,943
Not something to worry about for now

1243
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:45,503
They split over whether the research was prudent

1244
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:48,575
So any kind of argument that happened in that

1245
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:49,599
The

1246
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:54,463
It's worth it is it good

1247
01:10:57,023 --> 01:11:03,167
Is this is this a legitimate risk that we are defending against

1248
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:04,703
Vaccine for mausbach

1249
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:08,543
For mice

1250
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:09,311
Or is it

1251
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:12,127
I don't I don't

1252
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:14,943
Hello

1253
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:19,039
Back to

1254
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:19,807
The Norway

1255
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:22,623
We're a little bit later in the show Alex's no reason

1256
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:24,159
Do not know a lot of it

1257
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:24,927
Details about it

1258
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:26,463
Other than him not really

1259
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:30,559
Caring to not really caring to do his job as a journalist right

1260
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:32,095
You get back to it

1261
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:35,423
And makes it very clear that

1262
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:37,215
You knew that it would be jihadis

1263
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:43,615
Norway blast Target

1264
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:48,223
Total chaos

1265
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:51,295
Helpers of the global Jihad responsibilities

1266
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:57,439
I meant yet how helpers of the anode rod

1267
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:58,463
Responsibility

1268
01:11:59,231 --> 01:11:59,999
And this is an issue that

1269
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:03,071
Claimed responsibility for

1270
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:05,631
That's why you have to always

1271
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:08,703
Situations

1272
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:11,007
You can't just say oh they said

1273
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:14,335
Yeah so he's not doing that he's not following appropriate

1274
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:17,663
It's for Isis

1275
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:23,039
Is to claim responsibility for every terrorist bombing as though they are everywhere all the time

1276
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:27,903
You know terrorists

1277
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:29,183
Vic creating Terror

1278
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:30,207
Right that's it

1279
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:31,231
To help them when they take

1280
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:31,999
Responsibility

1281
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:37,631
She said it's really good because oftentimes

1282
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:38,399
People don't survive

1283
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:47,871
Because what are you going to be mad at you that you're lying

1284
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:54,271
You're already enough people are going to believe you regardless

1285
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:57,087
Whether or not

1286
01:12:57,343 --> 01:13:01,183
Alex

1287
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:01,951
What's called like

1288
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:06,559
A dominating strategy

1289
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:09,631
And you have to do quick because another terrorist group from my

1290
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:11,935
Do the same thing

1291
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:13,471
First one

1292
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:19,871
Recording very generally that they did it

1293
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:22,943
Ron Perlman

1294
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:25,247
Cowboys

1295
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:31,903
This is why

1296
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:34,975
Addresses police officer open

1297
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:38,815
Now reportedly there's been a shooting

1298
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:41,887
That we should have just shifted this earlier this is Shelby

1299
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:45,727
In Norway

1300
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:55,711
It was dress like a cop

1301
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:57,503
Help us

1302
01:13:58,015 --> 01:14:01,855
Norway

1303
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:02,879
T-jump f***

1304
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:04,927
Guess what you can own guns in Norway

1305
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:10,047
Don't they have

1306
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:12,095
American Construction

1307
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:14,655
But you ain't guess what

1308
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:16,447
Hey guess what I know from reading his

1309
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:17,983
He's goddamn Manifesto

1310
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:20,799
He bought the guns in Norway

1311
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:21,823
Legally

1312
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:23,871
You can buy gun

1313
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:25,663
Except for automatic weapons

1314
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:26,431
In Norway

1315
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:30,271
They just have some standards like in terms of if you're going to buy a gun

1316
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:32,831
You need to have some training courses

1317
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:34,623
And you need to give a

1318
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:41,535
Some of the reasons that they are allow

1319
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:43,071
Right Recreation

1320
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:45,631
Self-defense

1321
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:51,263
Our if you are employed in a like

1322
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:56,383
Active

1323
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:57,407
To own a gun

1324
01:14:57,663 --> 01:14:58,175
Alex

1325
01:14:58,431 --> 01:14:59,455
You are a gun guy

1326
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:00,991
You should know gun laws

1327
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:03,551
Guns are not outlawed in Norway

1328
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:04,319
The same way

1329
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:05,855
He would like that to be the case

1330
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:08,671
Right

1331
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:11,487
It's cuz they were on an island

1332
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:13,791
There was a guard there

1333
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:14,815
Anders Breivik

1334
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:17,375
Smart enough

1335
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:18,911
But he was aware enough to

1336
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:20,447
Kill that guy immediately

1337
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:27,103
So he took that guy out the guy with a gun right in order to neutral

1338
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:33,503
Only argument is like every one of those children

1339
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:36,063
Ever to be the world

1340
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:38,879
Absolutely the wrong angle

1341
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:43,743
Ifucking camp where they're learning and they're clearly politically-motivated cuz it's

1342
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:45,535
Labour party

1343
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:48,351
Political camp

1344
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:50,399
A good time you got to assume that if they're like

1345
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:52,959
A lot of people were under 18

1346
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:53,727
Who are there

1347
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:54,495
Probably f******

1348
01:15:54,751 --> 01:16:00,895
Nerds yeah I don't mean that to be a dick when I was a kid

1349
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:09,087
Really hard to zip line when you have an AKA on your back I'm having gun

1350
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:15,487
And if

1351
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:22,655
Yeah you don't want them having gun

1352
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:26,495
Because they would not know how to use them they're not

1353
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:27,263
Sort of

1354
01:16:27,519 --> 01:16:28,031
Sympathy

1355
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:30,335
Rambo kid that Alex is probably imagine

1356
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:38,015
Discuss super clear

1357
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:38,783
If you're listening

1358
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:39,551
AngelList

1359
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:41,343
None of

1360
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:43,391
The only reason we are laughing

1361
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:46,719
Because this is

1362
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:47,487
Beyond

1363
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:48,511
Comprehend

1364
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:56,447
Put the prescriptions that Alex is making or f******

1365
01:16:56,703 --> 01:16:57,983
Doing is laughing about

1366
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:06,431
Movie f****** don't to what u.s. Constitution

1367
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:07,711
You can have gun

1368
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:10,015
Any ideas like oh there was no 12

1369
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:13,343
Protect those

1370
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:15,135
And you don't want these

1371
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:18,463
It would it would make for first of all.

1372
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:20,255
I meant

1373
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:21,023
Sandoval

1374
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:23,071
Like like we're joking around about

1375
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:24,351
Spell they don't want to

1376
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:25,887
Have gun they want to go to

1377
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:28,191
So

1378
01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:31,007
Sucks

1379
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:36,383
Every part of being alive now

1380
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:38,175
Yep

1381
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:39,455
So now it's going to suck

1382
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:42,271
I'm going to get into the

1383
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:43,039
The Manifest

1384
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:49,951
Alex has brought back up

1385
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:50,975
He's brought back up the

1386
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:55,071
Most difficult planning on how we're going to cover this episode

1387
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:56,863
At what point do we get into the

1388
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:58,911
And I I don't know I don't know if it's the best

1389
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:01,215
But we got it

1390
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:05,823
Embarking on the attack Andrews brevik emailed

1391
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:06,591
His

1392
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:09,663
Page Manifesto

1393
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:12,991
To approximately 1,000 email addresses that he had Farms

1394
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:14,783
From European Patriot Facebook account

1395
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:15,551
Too long

1396
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:16,319
He spent

1397
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:17,087
Hours

1398
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:18,879
H and

1399
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:22,207
Farming these email addresses off Facebook account

1400
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:22,975
Cuz he wanted to try and

1401
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:24,767
Within

1402
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:26,303
Superreactionary

1403
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:27,327
Patriot

1404
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:28,095
The base

1405
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:28,863
European

1406
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:31,423
Facebook

1407
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:34,239
1508

1408
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:36,287
Pages

1409
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:39,103
Various other sources

1410
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:39,871
Did a bunch of stuff

1411
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:42,943
Unabomber replace every time you said

1412
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:43,711
The black people

1413
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:44,735
With Muslims

1414
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:46,015
Replaced

1415
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:49,087
Trying to make it his own

1416
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:50,623
Wow copy and paste

1417
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:54,975
At least hundreds of pages

1418
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:58,047
He only had like sex

1419
01:18:59,071 --> 01:19:01,631
The outrageously long document lays out his

1420
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:03,935
Political correctness anti-semitism

1421
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:06,495
Nationalism

1422
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:07,775
Clear as day

1423
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:10,335
It even describes exactly why he committed

1424
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:11,615
These terrorist attacks

1425
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:12,639
We plan the attacks

1426
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:14,687
4 years before carrying them out

1427
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:16,735
And how he lamented that you have to work alone

1428
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:17,759
He couldn't risk

1429
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:19,807
Anyone else being involved

1430
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:23,135
Might give up

1431
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:24,159
Police

1432
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:25,951
Or whether or not

1433
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:28,255
It would be a risk for them to know

1434
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:30,047
About it when you go through

1435
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:34,399
Could jeopardize a conspiracy

1436
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:35,935
Is the worst

1437
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:37,983
Right it's the worst idea

1438
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:41,055
Illegitimate

1439
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:42,079
Terrible idea

1440
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:44,895
M brevik Manifesto

1441
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:47,199
Overwhelmed Bible

1442
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:49,759
I braced myself and dug-in but ultimately had to

1443
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:52,319
Concede there's no way I was ever going to read all this b*******

1444
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:54,623
I made it through couple hundred pages

1445
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:56,927
100

1446
01:19:57,439 --> 01:20:02,047
With rambling complaints about history ranging from declined evils of cultural Marxism

1447
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:05,119
Deciding crimes Muslims committed in the 1100

1448
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:06,143
Is proof of islamism

1449
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:06,911
Incompatible

1450
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:07,935
Western

1451
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:09,727
Put some cookie

1452
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:11,007
Better actually

1453
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:13,824
Well if your cookie

1454
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:15,872
Yeah oh no I thought I was

1455
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:16,896
I'd like

1456
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:18,944
I don't normally like raisin cookies

1457
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,224
But I heard that his

1458
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:23,040
I wish there was

1459
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:25,600
I would really big.

1460
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:26,880
Like this

1461
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:27,904
How much nonsense

1462
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:29,952
I really wouldn't

1463
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:36,352
Oh and by the way my favorite Sunday I like to wake up at about 9

1464
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:37,888
She has like

1465
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:38,912
Legitimate

1466
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:40,960
Pages upon pages

1467
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:44,032
A various different like armor schematic

1468
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:45,056
You could use

1469
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:45,824
If you wanted

1470
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:48,896
Commit smash-and-grab terrorist attack

1471
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:51,456
Cookie recipe

1472
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:56,576
100 f****** it's entirely possible

1473
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:00,160
You didn't even

1474
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:01,184
Ice cream.

1475
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:09,120
Like I said I read at least a couple hundred

1476
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:11,424
You don't need to read this whole document

1477
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:12,704
To see shocking parallel

1478
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:19,104
The totalitarian nature of political correctness

1479
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:22,176
Can be seen on campuses where PC is taking over the college

1480
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:23,456
Freedom speech

1481
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:24,224
Of the press

1482
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,016
And even thought are all eliminate

1483
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:29,600
Or you can skip the page 29 where you find this

1484
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:32,160
Quote today the feminization of European culture

1485
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:34,208
Moving rapidly since the 1960s

1486
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:35,488
Continues to intensify

1487
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,304
Indeed the present-day radical feminist assault

1488
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:40,096
Support of mass movement immigration

1489
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:43,168
Has political parallel to their anti-colonial effort

1490
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:49,568
Is impart a continuation of a century-old effort to destroy traditional European structures

1491
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:51,872
The very Foundation of European culture

1492
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:55,456
Indeed the feminization of European culture is nearly completed

1493
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:57,504
And the last Bastion of male domination

1494
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:00,064
The police force and Military is under assault

1495
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:05,952
An awful lot like Alex Jones saying that all these strong powerful

1496
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:09,280
Simoniz just roll over there

1497
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:12,096
Yep

1498
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:22,080
At their very existence more trendy than boyfriend

1499
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:23,872
Irene

1500
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:28,992
This guy is it finally honest about the police in the military

1501
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:34,112
Toxic masculinity white-dominated meals

1502
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:40,512
Telling the truth about it until the truth about it

1503
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:42,304
There's so many more parallel

1504
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:45,120
Braddock to cry cultural Marxism

1505
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:48,448
Quiet Revolution propagating the European hate ideology

1506
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:49,472
With the gold

1507
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:51,008
Destroying Western Civilization

1508
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:53,056
And which one

1509
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:59,456
And which was anti-god anti-christian

1510
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:04,320
Anti masculine anti tradition

1511
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:05,856
An anti morality

1512
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:12,512
What are you putting all that list together that's exactly

1513
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:15,840
Exactly a cultural Marxism is

1514
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:17,120
Just replace globalist

1515
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:18,656
Whenever he says cultural Marxism

1516
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:19,936
Because it's the same

1517
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:21,728
Put down to the world

1518
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:24,544
Cultural Marxism is this idea that like

1519
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:27,360
Classical economic Marxist ideas

1520
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:30,176
Had to do largely with the redistribution of power

1521
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:33,248
That sort of thing

1522
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:36,320
Economic power

1523
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:37,344
To the cultural mark

1524
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:38,112
Closest idea

1525
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:39,648
Is the idea of

1526
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:40,928
Multiculturalism

1527
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:42,208
Feminism

1528
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:43,744
Racerite

1529
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:44,768
Those sorts of things

1530
01:23:45,024 --> 01:23:47,840
Have to do with a cultural version of Marxism

1531
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:49,888
Where you're trying to redistribute

1532
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:51,424
The power forcefully

1533
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:54,752
What they're trying to fly

1534
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:55,776
It's saying

1535
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:56,800
What they're trying to him

1536
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:57,568
Plaid

1537
01:23:57,824 --> 01:23:58,336
Is bad

1538
01:23:58,592 --> 01:24:01,664
Vidi5

1539
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:04,224
An equitable exist

1540
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:06,784
Wherein there is no domination

1541
01:24:07,552 --> 01:24:10,112
By any one of these groups of all the other

1542
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:11,904
That is a

1543
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:13,952
Stealth way of creating bat-like

1544
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:16,768
That's soviet-era communism

1545
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:17,792
Which again

1546
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:20,352
Economic system the issue with

1547
01:24:20,608 --> 01:24:21,120
Government

1548
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:22,144
Set the minutes

1549
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:23,424
Nazi

1550
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:24,704
The concepts behind

1551
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:28,544
Hey maybe everybody should

1552
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,336
It was the oligarchy that

1553
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:33,408
Once again

1554
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:34,688
We live in such

1555
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:36,992
Let's not go too far down this road

1556
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:39,040
Apologize

1557
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:42,624
Apologies

1558
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,416
Alex tells about how their opponent

1559
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:45,952
Refuse to engage with ideas

1560
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:48,000
I just shut them down by calling them

1561
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:52,352
All discussion Hippie Sabotage with the slogan

1562
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:54,912
Prejudice and racism islamophobia

1563
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:57,472
Take the struggle from the common battlefield of argument

1564
01:24:57,728 --> 01:24:58,752
Into the opponent's camp

1565
01:24:59,008 --> 01:25:01,568
His self-esteem as a member of civilized society

1566
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:03,104
Of course ugly things

1567
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:04,640
Prejudice in islamophobia

1568
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:09,248
Are you recognizing in this Manifesto not only the everything

1569
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:11,296
Represent modern Alex Jones

1570
01:25:11,552 --> 01:25:13,088
But also so much

1571
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:14,112
That represent

1572
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:15,392
The modern-day right

1573
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:20,768
Didn't you just go to a pool supply store in like saw three Muslim women and he was like

1574
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:22,560
Does this all right

1575
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:23,584
Now

1576
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:26,400
I've only it was that simple Supply

1577
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:31,520
Superficial

1578
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:34,592
His plan for the future is specifically pro-russia

1579
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:37,408
Provided the Russia kicks out all the Muslims

1580
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:40,224
He's also pro.app are tied South Africa

1581
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:40,992
Coincidentally

1582
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:45,088
If what is it supposes that he imagined

1583
01:25:45,344 --> 01:25:49,184
If it wanted to soldiers and Andrews Braddock's imagine

1584
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:49,952
Exist

1585
01:25:52,768 --> 01:25:58,912
Traffic is a whole speech prepared for them in his Manifesto

1586
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:00,704
Not laminate

1587
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:04,032
The speech that he has for them

1588
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:06,080
It includes the Thomas Jefferson quote

1589
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:08,128
The tree of Liberty must be refreshed

1590
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:10,432
From time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants

1591
01:26:10,944 --> 01:26:14,016
Which coincidentally is something I was doing

1592
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:20,672
Coincidence that the other has in his speech that these people are supposed to read in court is Mark Twain's quote

1593
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:23,488
The time of change the Patriot is scarce man

1594
01:26:23,744 --> 01:26:27,328
He's hated and scorned when it's caused

1595
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:30,144
When the Patriot

1596
01:26:30,656 --> 01:26:31,936
Cosmo

1597
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:34,752
Alex says all the f****** time

1598
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:36,032
People are using the

1599
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:39,104
Exactly tropes in terms of pushing

1600
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:42,944
I'm very idea of what they want the world to be

1601
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,736
And how to justify their actions

1602
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:48,832
All of which are perversions of the meaning of those

1603
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:49,856
To some extent

1604
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:53,952
Rambling Manifesto everything isn't Alex Jones talking

1605
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:56,768
Quotes the patriarchy must be established

1606
01:26:57,024 --> 01:26:57,792
Re-established

1607
01:26:58,048 --> 01:26:59,584
News corporation

1608
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,888
Controlled by cultural marxists multiculturalism

1609
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:04,192
Engagement full scale War

1610
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:06,240
Cultural conservatism in nationalism

1611
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:12,384
For every newborn Muslim in Europe the cultural marxists Multicultural is to automatically get one more vote

1612
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:16,480
And we all know 98% of Muslims give their votes to multiculturalism

1613
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:19,296
Is King

1614
01:27:19,552 --> 01:27:21,856
The traditional family is under attack

1615
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:24,928
It goes on and on to the point where it's different

1616
01:27:25,184 --> 01:27:28,256
Between Frederick and Alex's vision of an ideal Society

1617
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:29,792
Reddick described his

1618
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:30,816
Quote one

1619
01:27:31,072 --> 01:27:32,352
Islam cannot be present

1620
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:33,120
2

1621
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:34,656
And ethnic homogeneous people

1622
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:35,424
3

1623
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:37,728
An educated people with high average IQ

1624
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:38,496
4

1625
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:40,288
Cultural conservative policies

1626
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:41,568
Nationalistic polish

1627
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:42,592
5

1628
01:27:43,104 --> 01:27:43,616
Free market

1629
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:46,944
All of this is exactly

1630
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:48,736
What Alex would be in line

1631
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:51,296
Whether he would be

1632
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:52,064
F******

1633
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:52,832
I wouldn't say

1634
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:54,368
Play brave enough because that

1635
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:55,648
The positive connotation

1636
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:58,208
The weather or not he would have the wherewithal

1637
01:27:58,464 --> 01:27:59,744
To actually see things like

1638
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,048
What I would like is Islam to be gone

1639
01:28:02,304 --> 01:28:05,120
What I would like is an ethnically homogeneous people to be around me

1640
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:07,168
Whether or not he has the

1641
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:08,960
I would say

1642
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:10,496
Schnitz because you know

1643
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:11,776
But he's trying to make money off

1644
01:28:13,568 --> 01:28:14,336
He does believe those

1645
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:15,360
Absolute

1646
01:28:15,616 --> 01:28:17,920
His actions imply very clearly

1647
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:20,480
Him and Anders Breivik

1648
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:22,528
Exactly the same positive vision

1649
01:28:22,784 --> 01:28:23,296
What they want

1650
01:28:24,064 --> 01:28:27,904
64 * in the manifesto bread excites Robert Spencer

1651
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:30,976
The anti-muslim proprietor of the website Jihad watch

1652
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:37,120
Coincidentally Robert Spencer is a regular guest on Alex's show and Alex uses Jihad watch as a source consta

1653
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:40,448
Reddick was a big admirer of geert Wilders

1654
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:41,472
Someone Alex

1655
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:43,520
Actively came back 2 hours

1656
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:45,824
Alex

1657
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:46,848
And said was part of

1658
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:48,896
The Nationalist resurgence

1659
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:50,688
Red excited Wilder's

1660
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:55,552
He's one of the few who can quote claim to be conservative parties in their whole culture

1661
01:28:56,576 --> 01:29:00,672
Traffic also in his Manifesto expressing support for the English Defence League

1662
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:03,232
Hopelessly naive

1663
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:06,816
Before committing his attack brevik helps create a Norway satellite of

1664
01:29:07,072 --> 01:29:07,584
The edl

1665
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:08,352
The Norway

1666
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:10,400
The edl

1667
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:13,472
In case you forgotten was created by Tommy Robinson

1668
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:18,336
Alright personality Vox Dei admirers and love

1669
01:29:18,848 --> 01:29:19,360
Peter's brevik

1670
01:29:19,616 --> 01:29:21,664
He refers to Ramona's blog is think bread

1671
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:22,944
That's not good

1672
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:25,504
Vox day has been a guest on Alex Jones Show

1673
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:26,784
As recently as

1674
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:29,088
In August 2018

1675
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:37,024
You read through this Manifesto in

1676
01:29:39,328 --> 01:29:40,352
The modern right

1677
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:42,144
In our country

1678
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:45,472
It's horrifying

1679
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:49,056
This is what I'm talking about when I said I didn't understand

1680
01:29:49,312 --> 01:29:51,616
Like I knew he was a bigot terrorists and all that stuff

1681
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:53,152
But reading through this

1682
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:54,176
Manifesto

1683
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:55,968
Inasmuch as I did

1684
01:29:56,736 --> 01:29:57,248
Is

1685
01:29:58,016 --> 01:29:59,040
A terrifying experience

1686
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:00,064
Because

1687
01:30:00,576 --> 01:30:01,344
What you see

1688
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:08,000
And I'm not saying that all of these people have read his Manifesto and are going off of it would be f****** stupid

1689
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:08,768
Assume

1690
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:10,048
But what you see

1691
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:12,864
Are Proto talking points

1692
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:14,912
Of the alt-right world

1693
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:18,752
Zach we are experiencing right now

1694
01:30:19,008 --> 01:30:20,032
Which is

1695
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:21,568
Which is the entire Republic

1696
01:30:21,824 --> 01:30:25,664
Complicated because we're specifically talking about him

1697
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:26,688
Is because

1698
01:30:26,944 --> 01:30:28,224
He in his Manifesto

1699
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:34,624
Although it should be noted that while he was in prison he did come out and say I'm

1700
01:30:35,648 --> 01:30:36,160
Who knows

1701
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:38,208
Because he finally read

1702
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:40,000
Nasty literature was like

1703
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:45,120
Or maybe the tide had changed

1704
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:53,312
The people who are sending him messages of support were National Socialist

1705
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:54,336
Any realized

1706
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:58,176
Well maybe this is my team after all I'm in prison what am I going to do

1707
01:30:58,432 --> 01:31:04,576
Completed your you're

1708
01:31:05,088 --> 01:31:06,880
Circle of coming around

1709
01:31:07,648 --> 01:31:10,720
The right to just simply be ignored and demolish

1710
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:11,744
No

1711
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,280
May be demolished but not ignored

1712
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:15,328
I think

1713
01:31:15,584 --> 01:31:17,120
I think that what you see here

1714
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:18,400
I think

1715
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:20,704
In 2011

1716
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:22,240
This world was not

1717
01:31:23,008 --> 01:31:23,520
What it is now

1718
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:25,056
In terms of

1719
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:26,336
Alex wasn't

1720
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:30,432
In 2011 in terms of his books

1721
01:31:32,224 --> 01:31:32,736
Open about it

1722
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:34,272
The traction that

1723
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:35,552
Game by organization

1724
01:31:35,808 --> 01:31:36,320
Like

1725
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:39,648
Rebel media people like Jack

1726
01:31:39,904 --> 01:31:40,416
Sawbuck

1727
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:44,000
People like Lauren Southern

1728
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:46,560
Samantha has come to be such a

1729
01:31:46,816 --> 01:31:47,328
Part of our

1730
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:49,120
Political dialogue

1731
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:52,448
These negative and Ill

1732
01:31:52,704 --> 01:31:53,728
Meaning

1733
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:54,752
Bad faith

1734
01:31:56,032 --> 01:31:57,312
That are clogging up

1735
01:31:57,568 --> 01:31:59,360
Our political discourse

1736
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:00,384
Including

1737
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,664
Goddamn president

1738
01:32:02,688 --> 01:32:03,968
Whether or not they know it

1739
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:05,760
I believe that they are very

1740
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:06,784
Very

1741
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:07,808
Inspired

1742
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:09,344
By the manifesto that and

1743
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:10,112
Braddock put out

1744
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:12,416
And I don't think in any way that he was

1745
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:18,560
But I think that his martyrdom in quotes

1746
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:20,096
Vic neo-Nazi

1747
01:32:20,864 --> 01:32:22,400
Anti-muslim Folk

1748
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:23,424
Experian

1749
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:26,496
Led to an elevation of a lot of the talking

1750
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:29,056
That he put through in his

1751
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:33,664
Manifesto

1752
01:32:34,432 --> 01:32:36,480
I think you got a lot more traction then maybe even

1753
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:37,248
He realizes

1754
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:43,648
From his self translating

1755
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:46,464
Open

1756
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:47,488
Obviously

1757
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:49,024
Again

1758
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:50,560
It's stupid to say

1759
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:55,680
No they haven't they have a conclusion on their own

1760
01:32:55,936 --> 01:32:56,704
Because

1761
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:57,728
There

1762
01:32:57,984 --> 01:32:58,496
F******

1763
01:32:59,008 --> 01:33:01,312
It's just got f****** jarring

1764
01:33:01,824 --> 01:33:02,592
Specific

1765
01:33:02,848 --> 01:33:04,896
People mentioned in the manifesto

1766
01:33:05,152 --> 01:33:06,176
Alex Jones

1767
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:07,712
Respects and loves

1768
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:10,528
It's jarring to the exact stalking

1769
01:33:10,784 --> 01:33:12,320
Pinpoint if you just replace

1770
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:15,136
Cultural marxists with globalist

1771
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:17,184
It's f******

1772
01:33:18,464 --> 01:33:19,744
The similarities that receipt

1773
01:33:20,256 --> 01:33:21,024
Very very

1774
01:33:22,048 --> 01:33:23,072
I think that's fair.

1775
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:26,400
For confirmation of course they are

1776
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:28,192
Are you looking at me

1777
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:28,960
Like

1778
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:31,264
That's fair

1779
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:35,104
So they're really troubling because now it's time to explain the name of his

1780
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:35,872
Manifesto

1781
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:39,712
It's called 2083 a European Declaration of

1782
01:33:39,968 --> 01:33:40,480
Independence

1783
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:43,808
Because toward the tail end of his very long very dumb.

1784
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:45,856
Anders Breivik lays out his vision

1785
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:47,136
What will happen in the future

1786
01:33:47,648 --> 01:33:52,000
Namely a 3-phase European Civil War which he believed he would help start

1787
01:33:52,256 --> 01:33:54,304
Leading to the

1788
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:55,328
Reclaiming their world

1789
01:33:55,584 --> 01:33:56,096
In 28

1790
01:33:58,144 --> 01:33:58,912
Dirty thoughts

1791
01:33:59,168 --> 01:34:00,192
I don't want to steamroll you

1792
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:04,800
My first thought

1793
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:06,848
Is not to engage with the content

1794
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:16,576
2083

1795
01:34:16,832 --> 01:34:22,976
1500

1796
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:29,376
Document

1797
01:34:29,632 --> 01:34:35,776
What was all the refugees coming in from all the different places I think those are white

1798
01:34:42,432 --> 01:34:42,944
What the f***

1799
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:43,968
Why are we

1800
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:48,832
Are you sure we can't kill him

1801
01:34:49,344 --> 01:34:49,856
I can't

1802
01:34:50,624 --> 01:34:51,136
I know that

1803
01:34:51,648 --> 01:34:52,160
Yeah okay

1804
01:34:52,672 --> 01:34:53,696
Okay

1805
01:34:53,952 --> 01:34:54,464
Sonia

1806
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:55,488
Note

1807
01:34:57,024 --> 01:35:03,168
Norway

1808
01:35:03,424 --> 01:35:05,216
Whataburger richforce

1809
01:35:05,472 --> 01:35:11,616
Friend Norway you got to have one friend in Norway I don't bother

1810
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:13,664
Universal thing your calls for murder

1811
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:19,040
Love you so much I want a I want a penpal

1812
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:21,088
Who is willing to murder this guy

1813
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:27,488
I think you have to Ocean's 11 is really high in the most highly secured prisoners

1814
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:28,768
In the entire country

1815
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:35,168
Yeah prisoner who's like the longest sentence

1816
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:37,728
Because

1817
01:35:37,984 --> 01:35:38,496
I mean

1818
01:35:39,264 --> 01:35:42,336
If you read his Manifesto It's f****** clear his planning

1819
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:44,896
Doing this for years

1820
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:46,432
He started a company

1821
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:47,712
Specifically

1822
01:35:48,224 --> 01:35:48,992
Get enough money

1823
01:35:49,248 --> 01:35:50,016
In order to

1824
01:35:50,272 --> 01:35:50,784
To do the attack

1825
01:35:51,296 --> 01:35:56,928
He ended up getting like 2 million

1826
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:59,744
But it would have been a hundred thousand

1827
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:00,768
The dollar is worth

1828
01:36:01,024 --> 01:36:03,072
A money from this company and then walked away

1829
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:04,096
Because he was just trying

1830
01:36:04,352 --> 01:36:04,864
Raise the money

1831
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:05,888
In order to

1832
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:07,424
To fund his ability to

1833
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:08,448
To plan this attack

1834
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:13,568
Like it's an interlude Icarus

1835
01:36:13,824 --> 01:36:14,592
Level of like

1836
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:15,872
Very specific

1837
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:17,408
Information they like

1838
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:19,968
Anybody who anybody who wants to be like

1839
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:23,040
This was something that the globalist that up or some of that

1840
01:36:23,296 --> 01:36:24,576
They're not engaging with

1841
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:27,648
Very very available information

1842
01:36:28,672 --> 01:36:29,696
From him

1843
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:30,720
Do you have any

1844
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:34,304
Indication of

1845
01:36:35,072 --> 01:36:36,608
Was there like a turning point

1846
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:41,984
He's asked how old was he

1847
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:44,032
I don't use 39 now

1848
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:47,872
This would have been like it's 17

1849
01:36:48,384 --> 01:36:49,152
Probably some

1850
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:53,760
I don't know I don't even listen I like 40

1851
01:36:54,016 --> 01:36:55,040
But I also feel like

1852
01:36:55,296 --> 01:36:56,576
People who do the

1853
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:58,368
I would

1854
01:36:58,624 --> 01:37:01,696
Comfortable in assuming that they kind of

1855
01:37:01,952 --> 01:37:03,488
Create a heroic mythology around

1856
01:37:03,744 --> 01:37:07,328
Unreliable narrator aspect

1857
01:37:07,584 --> 01:37:08,096
2

1858
01:37:08,352 --> 01:37:09,632
Exactly why they're right

1859
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:15,776
He says he's radicalized by the Serbian really all that was with to give him cover

1860
01:37:16,032 --> 01:37:16,800
And make him a

1861
01:37:17,056 --> 01:37:20,896
0 possibly

1862
01:37:21,408 --> 01:37:22,432
Still with him from the f******

1863
01:37:22,688 --> 01:37:26,528
Everything about it is Mom

1864
01:37:27,552 --> 01:37:29,344
I know about his mom from

1865
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:31,392
Who's the Chad nest

1866
01:37:31,648 --> 01:37:32,928
DDD feels really bad about it

1867
01:37:33,184 --> 01:37:39,328
Is this your Manifesto

1868
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:45,984
He has HPV to the family

1869
01:37:48,288 --> 01:37:51,104
Just consider his sort of a patriarchal

1870
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:53,408
Views and stuff like that like

1871
01:37:53,664 --> 01:37:54,176
Turn kitchen

1872
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:55,712
And not f******

1873
01:37:56,992 --> 01:37:58,272
Describes

1874
01:37:58,528 --> 01:37:59,040
Involves like

1875
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:00,832
Lights by Pakistani

1876
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:03,392
Anaerobe

1877
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:05,696
Obviously that stuff was already in him

1878
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:10,304
From the jump is more racism

1879
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:11,328
Coming from pack

1880
01:38:11,584 --> 01:38:15,680
Sandy's in Arab stores white people ever

1881
01:38:15,936 --> 01:38:21,568
Pakistanis in Muslims are like that that's crazy I had a friend Junior High who hated

1882
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:24,640
Started before the game a little bit

1883
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:26,688
But the reason

1884
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:28,480
Business

1885
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:29,760
And he got

1886
01:38:30,016 --> 01:38:30,784
In a deal with

1887
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:31,552
A couple

1888
01:38:32,064 --> 01:38:33,600
Individual

1889
01:38:33,856 --> 01:38:34,368
Arabic

1890
01:38:35,136 --> 01:38:36,416
And the deal went bad

1891
01:38:36,928 --> 01:38:37,440
And

1892
01:38:37,696 --> 01:38:38,464
The dad I guess

1893
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:39,488
Complain so much

1894
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:41,024
Middle School child

1895
01:38:42,304 --> 01:38:44,096
Extrapolated in generalized

1896
01:38:44,352 --> 01:38:45,888
To all people who are Arabic

1897
01:38:46,144 --> 01:38:46,656
Or Muslims

1898
01:38:46,912 --> 01:38:48,192
You read this

1899
01:38:48,448 --> 01:38:50,496
You read this Manifesto into stuff he talks about 4

1900
01:38:50,752 --> 01:38:51,776
From like his childhood

1901
01:38:52,288 --> 01:38:53,056
I think there's a little

1902
01:38:53,824 --> 01:38:55,872
Colonel was already there

1903
01:38:56,384 --> 01:38:57,664
I don't want to psychoanalyze

1904
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:59,968
Say like you don't care about the Serbian bombing

1905
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:03,552
His house f***

1906
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:05,344
This f******

1907
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:06,368
Yeah

1908
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:12,000
If we could executed let's say 100,000 Marxist intellectuals in Western Europe after World War II

1909
01:39:12,256 --> 01:39:14,304
And all forms of marxist Doctrine

1910
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:18,912
We could have prevented the creation of anti-european hate ideology known as multiculturalism

1911
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:19,680
God

1912
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:21,728
Do that mental

1913
01:39:22,496 --> 01:39:27,616
It's absolutely essential that we the cultural conservative Patriots of Europe to not repeat that mistake again

1914
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:32,992
In all our efforts must be to Target and execute the Multicultural lift wherever we find them

1915
01:39:33,248 --> 01:39:36,320
In Phase 1 2 or 3 of the European Civil War

1916
01:39:36,832 --> 01:39:41,952
He goes on to Advocate against the deportation of Muslim vote for an even worse reason than you would guess

1917
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:46,560
The biggest threat to ineffective and thorough lynching campaign to The Temptations

1918
01:39:46,816 --> 01:39:48,096
Commence the deportation of Buzz

1919
01:39:48,864 --> 01:39:52,704
This is why lynching for should only professional leadership

1920
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:56,800
With a given unofficial and clandestine man no

1921
01:39:57,312 --> 01:39:58,336
No path

1922
01:39:58,592 --> 01:40:00,384
Pass no no

1923
01:40:01,664 --> 01:40:02,176
Ever

1924
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:08,832
I'm talking about

1925
01:40:12,416 --> 01:40:13,696
I know and this is awful

1926
01:40:13,952 --> 01:40:14,464
But

1927
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:16,768
My position is I'm reading all of this

1928
01:40:17,536 --> 01:40:18,048
Because

1929
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:19,584
Tunak

1930
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:20,352
Is not

1931
01:40:20,608 --> 01:40:21,376
To show what the lodge

1932
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:23,936
Of this similar rhetoric

1933
01:40:24,192 --> 01:40:24,960
Did Alex Jones

1934
01:40:25,216 --> 01:40:25,728
This guy

1935
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:30,336
Exactly point if I understand correctly

1936
01:40:30,592 --> 01:40:32,128
Is that if you ask

1937
01:40:34,432 --> 01:40:35,968
If you put the DeRidder eckhaus

1938
01:40:36,224 --> 01:40:39,808
Then this is the only way this is the only thing that makes

1939
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:42,368
I'm not saying actions or logical

1940
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:43,392
F****** hard

1941
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:44,416
But if

1942
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:46,976
Play Alex Jones's world

1943
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,280
There's no reason not to

1944
01:40:49,536 --> 01:40:50,304
Dedicate yourself

1945
01:40:50,816 --> 01:40:51,328
Gears

1946
01:40:51,584 --> 01:40:53,632
To planning some sort of event that you think

1947
01:40:53,888 --> 01:40:55,680
Is going to kick off a civil war Europe

1948
01:40:55,936 --> 01:40:57,728
Against the multiculturalism

1949
01:40:57,984 --> 01:40:59,264
You think or ruining

1950
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:01,312
White European culture

1951
01:41:01,568 --> 01:41:02,592
There's no what there's

1952
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:03,872
It does

1953
01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:05,408
It doesn't make logical sense

1954
01:41:06,432 --> 01:41:07,200
Twisted mind

1955
01:41:07,712 --> 01:41:10,016
If he had never killed anybody Alex Wood

1956
01:41:10,272 --> 01:41:10,784
Treat him as a hero

1957
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:14,112
She was like

1958
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:15,648
Public intellectual

1959
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:22,048
Who just put this out as a doctor

1960
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:28,704
Jordan

1961
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:31,776
Sorry

1962
01:41:32,288 --> 01:41:32,800
Freddie Gibbs

1963
01:41:33,056 --> 01:41:34,592
Gives advice on assassinations

1964
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:40,224
It's much more rational and pragmatic also focus on the easier unprotected Target

1965
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:43,040
Instead of sacrificing Good Men on an impossible Target

1966
01:41:43,296 --> 01:41:44,576
Explain

1967
01:41:46,112 --> 01:41:46,624
Cultural Marxism

5 category-b traitors within 2 hours

1970
01:41:56,096 --> 01:42:00,704
You are usually always be caught so it's going home and waiting for someone to knock on your door

1971
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:03,008
Move swiftly to your second target then the Third

1972
01:42:03,264 --> 01:42:03,776
Etcetera

1973
01:42:04,032 --> 01:42:05,568
YouTube

1974
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:06,592

01:42:06,848 --> 01:42:10,944
Should you do let's Multicultural if politician

1976
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:12,224
Noting that quotes

I severely burned category a arbitrator willing reality become a living symbol of what awaits individuals guilty

1978
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:21,440
I'm trying to sell their own people into Islamic slavery

1979
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:23,232
Is a deterrent

1980
01:42:23,488 --> 01:42:24,000
Contribute

1981
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:26,560
Do I spread fear in the hearts of the rest of the traitors

1982
01:42:26,816 --> 01:42:30,144
And will just cause more ideological dead body

1983
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:31,936
He or she will become a Living testament

1984
01:42:32,192 --> 01:42:35,008
Will happen to a category and betrayed

1985
01:42:35,264 --> 01:42:38,080
And everyone will learn that high treason is not without risk

1986
01:42:38,592 --> 01:42:39,872
You can't Call wifey

1987
01:42:41,152 --> 01:42:41,664
Never

1988
01:42:42,432 --> 01:42:43,200
Now I mean

1989
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:47,040
His goal is specifically

1990
01:42:47,296 --> 01:42:48,320
To spread

1991
01:42:48,576 --> 01:42:49,088
Fear

1992
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:51,136
Terrorist

1993
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:52,672
Go to the

1994
01:42:55,232 --> 01:42:58,048
He thinks journalists are Traders just like Alec

1995
01:42:58,304 --> 01:43:03,168
Annual Gatherings for journalists in all Western European country

1996
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:05,728
Few calories are considered the most

1997
01:43:05,984 --> 01:43:10,336
Targets for large-scale shakatak

1998
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:14,432
He also legitimately Advocates using weapons of mass destruction

1999
01:43:14,688 --> 01:43:15,968
Multiculturalism

2000
01:43:17,248 --> 01:43:23,136
Play WMV on fighting the cultural marxists Multicultural estrogens of Western Europe

2001
01:43:23,392 --> 01:43:24,672
Especially explosive weapon

2002
01:43:25,184 --> 01:43:28,512
Barrack Buster types fertilizer bombs in the lights

2003
01:43:28,768 --> 01:43:33,888
Other types of weapons of mass destruction biological and chemical must be considered as realistic options as well

2004
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:35,936
Dozens of pages of

2005
01:43:36,192 --> 01:43:36,704
Very specific

2006
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:38,240
Instructions on how to make bombs

2007
01:43:38,496 --> 01:43:43,104
Include the detailed breakdown of all the various Metals people would be awarded for killing traitors

2008
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:43,872
What is revolution

2009
01:43:44,128 --> 01:43:44,640
Kicks off

2010
01:43:44,896 --> 01:43:47,456
Family complicated operation plan

2011
01:43:47,712 --> 01:43:48,224
Protect

2012
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:49,760
Is Extreme is bombing power play

2013
01:43:50,528 --> 01:43:53,600
He's been countless hours of his life putting together this Manifesto

2014
01:43:53,856 --> 01:43:56,416
And it's clear from the text that you knew when he was writing it

2015
01:43:56,672 --> 01:43:58,208
But he was going to kill a bunch of people

2016
01:43:58,464 --> 01:44:00,512
He wrote this Manifesto and carried out his attacks

2017
01:44:01,024 --> 01:44:02,560
He believed the same things that Alex

2018
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:05,376
Namely that Muslims are destructive force

2019
01:44:05,632 --> 01:44:06,912
And they'll destroy Western culture

2020
01:44:07,424 --> 01:44:10,752
And they're being aided and abetted by a traitorous government Force

2021
01:44:11,264 --> 01:44:13,312
Anders Breivik calls them cultural marxists

2022
01:44:13,568 --> 01:44:14,848
Alex calls them globalist

2023
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:16,896
But they're talking about exactly the same

2024
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:19,712
Here's why the result of the utmost importance

2025
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:21,248
Anders Breivik

2026
01:44:22,528 --> 01:44:23,040
Ames attack

2027
01:44:23,296 --> 01:44:24,320
Represent as I said

2028
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:27,392
The Logical end result of the rhetoric that both he and Alex Jones

2029
01:44:27,648 --> 01:44:30,208
Employ about the world

2030
01:44:30,464 --> 01:44:32,768
But one of them is willing to put those beliefs into action

2031
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:35,072
The other mostly wants to make money off train

2032
01:44:35,328 --> 01:44:35,840
Coke's others

2033
01:44:36,096 --> 01:44:37,120
Send to doing the dirty work for him

2034
01:44:38,656 --> 01:44:39,680
And that is my position on

2035
01:44:39,936 --> 01:44:40,448
All of them

2036
01:44:41,216 --> 01:44:41,984
My position

2037
01:44:42,496 --> 01:44:44,800
Is that I think Anders brevik

2038
01:44:45,568 --> 01:44:46,080
Was

2039
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:46,848
Elect

2040
01:44:47,104 --> 01:44:48,128
Did President

2041
01:44:48,384 --> 01:44:49,152
Under the name

2042
01:44:51,456 --> 01:44:53,248
I m similarities he does talk about like

2043
01:44:53,504 --> 01:44:54,272
Paths where you can

2044
01:44:54,784 --> 01:44:55,552
Deport people

2045
01:44:55,808 --> 01:44:58,368
Lady does have like almost Trail of Tears

2046
01:44:58,624 --> 01:45:00,928
Free plans inside because

2047
01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:03,488
He's not talking about a genocide of Muslims

2048
01:45:05,024 --> 01:45:05,536
SAFE credit or not

2049
01:45:06,816 --> 01:45:10,656
Credit

2050
01:45:10,912 --> 01:45:16,288
I wish I could

2051
01:45:16,544 --> 01:45:19,104
Under no circumstances when talking about Isis

2052
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:20,128
Do you have to give it to

2053
01:45:26,784 --> 01:45:27,296
F******

2054
01:45:27,552 --> 01:45:33,696
Myself

2055
01:45:33,952 --> 01:45:37,024
Because he's not

2056
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:38,560
Does just talk about like

2057
01:45:40,096 --> 01:45:40,608
Two countries

2058
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:42,400
This weekend then

2059
01:45:42,656 --> 01:45:45,984
Exploit

2060
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:51,104
It essentially genocide through different

2061
01:45:52,896 --> 01:45:56,736
Our world and Alex

2062
01:45:56,992 --> 01:45:58,784
It's really important enough

2063
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:00,832
This is the entire philosophy

2064
01:46:01,088 --> 01:46:03,648
Recipe from the beginning of America

2065
01:46:04,416 --> 01:46:07,488
This is what America is

2066
01:46:07,744 --> 01:46:08,256
Built upon

2067
01:46:08,512 --> 01:46:11,328
The word

2068
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:16,960
If you can't accept it that's that's what the Constitution was written about

2069
01:46:17,728 --> 01:46:18,496
That's what it was

2070
01:46:19,008 --> 01:46:22,336
NFL to imagine that some sort of outlier

2071
01:46:22,592 --> 01:46:23,616
Some sort of like

2072
01:46:23,872 --> 01:46:27,456
Something so far outside of what the human race

2073
01:46:27,712 --> 01:46:28,736
Has ever even considered

2074
01:46:28,992 --> 01:46:35,136
Just really remember the 1776 is f****** Anders brevik

2075
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:40,000
And that's why reading over this Manifesto was

2076
01:46:40,256 --> 01:46:40,768
Such a dork

2077
01:46:41,024 --> 01:46:42,048
Look in the mirror 27

2078
01:46:44,096 --> 01:46:46,912
Not but I believe it and like looking in the mirror I'm

2079
01:46:47,168 --> 01:46:52,800
Did the finger is pointing at me right

2080
01:46:53,056 --> 01:46:53,824
But you wish you would

2081
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:56,384
Domino like you read the manifesto

2082
01:46:57,920 --> 01:46:59,968
And you see like

2083
01:47:02,272 --> 01:47:04,576
Like the idea of bringing back the patriarchy

2084
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:10,208
These are large-scale things that he would

2085
01:47:10,464 --> 01:47:12,000
Primarily motivated by

2086
01:47:12,256 --> 01:47:13,536
Under the attack

2087
01:47:13,792 --> 01:47:16,096
On

2088
01:47:16,352 --> 01:47:17,376
Bicultural

2089
01:47:17,632 --> 01:47:18,912
By political correctness

2090
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:20,448
Things that are exact

2091
01:47:20,704 --> 01:47:21,728
Exactly the same

2092
01:47:23,008 --> 01:47:25,056
I don't know what to do with this other than to say

2093
01:47:25,824 --> 01:47:26,848
F****** just take a second

2094
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:30,688
I wouldn't

2095
01:47:30,944 --> 01:47:31,712
It was a dick

2096
01:47:31,968 --> 01:47:32,480
Very just

2097
01:47:32,736 --> 01:47:33,504
Night of my life

2098
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:35,552
But if you do

2099
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:36,832
You'll see

2100
01:47:38,112 --> 01:47:38,624
Artio

2101
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:42,720
You'll see the stuff we talked about

2102
01:47:42,976 --> 01:47:44,000
It's profoundly.

2103
01:47:44,256 --> 01:47:46,048
Which is also why we will never become

2104
01:47:47,328 --> 01:47:48,352
I told you Jordan

2105
01:47:48,608 --> 01:47:50,912
Because my dark mirror is

2106
01:47:51,168 --> 01:47:56,032
I think episode 1 where that guy f**** Pig and I don't want to talk about what I did

2107
01:47:56,288 --> 01:47:57,568
But technically

2108
01:47:57,824 --> 01:47:58,336
Mirror

2109
01:47:59,616 --> 01:48:00,896
My episode is that one red one

2110
01:48:01,152 --> 01:48:01,664
Treadmill

2111
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:08,064
I'm not watching the show anymore

2112
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:08,832
Like this is

2113
01:48:09,344 --> 01:48:12,416
To f****** real

2114
01:48:12,672 --> 01:48:13,184
I'll go back

2115
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:15,488
I want to tell you

2116
01:48:18,048 --> 01:48:18,560
Horrible

2117
01:48:19,328 --> 01:48:20,608
I were about to get very sick

2118
01:48:21,888 --> 01:48:23,168
Because brevik

2119
01:48:23,424 --> 01:48:24,448
1500 page

2120
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:25,472
Festo

2121
01:48:27,008 --> 01:48:28,288
1410

2122
01:48:29,056 --> 01:48:32,128
Starts the way out something of a weird diary documenting

2123
01:48:32,384 --> 01:48:32,896
Journey tour

2124
01:48:33,152 --> 01:48:34,176
Is perceived martyrdom

2125
01:48:34,688 --> 01:48:37,248
Noting that he started working on this Manifesto in

2126
01:48:37,504 --> 01:48:38,528
In 2006

2127
01:48:38,784 --> 01:48:42,624
5 years before the eventual attacks

2128
01:48:43,136 --> 01:48:43,648
What do you mean

2129
01:48:44,416 --> 01:48:50,048
Are you never a caucus Diaries

2130
01:48:51,584 --> 01:48:54,912
He started in 2006 on his Manifesto

2131
01:48:55,168 --> 01:48:55,936
Canvas compendium

2132
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:57,728
You started

2133
01:48:57,984 --> 01:48:59,264
On his actual planning for

2134
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:01,312
For the attack for years prior to that

2135
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:03,360
So is 9 years

2136
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:04,384
Of planning

2137
01:49:05,152 --> 01:49:05,664
5

2138
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:06,432
For the

2139
01:49:06,944 --> 01:49:07,456
The manifesto

2140
01:49:07,968 --> 01:49:08,992
But this diary

2141
01:49:10,016 --> 01:49:10,784
It gives

2142
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:12,064
Such a weird

2143
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:14,112
And these days

2144
01:49:14,624 --> 01:49:15,136
Describe

2145
01:49:15,904 --> 01:49:16,672
F******

2146
01:49:17,184 --> 01:49:21,536
Yeah when you consider that he knew as he was writing this.

2147
01:49:21,792 --> 01:49:23,584
Is he's going to kill a bunch of people

2148
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:24,864
Breeze perceived

2149
01:49:25,376 --> 01:49:26,400
He has but multiculturalism

2150
01:49:27,424 --> 01:49:28,192
When you read this

2151
01:49:29,728 --> 01:49:30,240
Disappointing

2152
01:49:30,496 --> 01:49:31,008
Sad pics

2153
01:49:31,264 --> 01:49:33,312
Picture of a person

2154
01:49:33,568 --> 01:49:34,592
Cuz that would have been really weak

2155
01:49:37,408 --> 01:49:40,224
My best friend Peter's 30th birthday

2156
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:44,576
We're going to Budapest party hard for 5 days

2157
01:49:46,112 --> 01:49:49,952
You don't get to do that hold on

2158
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:52,512
Hungarian girls are hot as hell

2159
01:49:52,768 --> 01:49:55,584
Relationships with a good of my mission

2160
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:57,632
Doesn't hurt to have a little fun

2161
01:49:57,888 --> 01:49:58,912
And then there's an emoticon

2162
01:49:59,168 --> 01:50:05,312
With V8 is Manifesto

2163
01:50:05,568 --> 01:50:07,360
It's the two eyes

2164
01:50:07,616 --> 01:50:12,480
The Colon D smiling face

2165
01:50:12,736 --> 01:50:15,040
Teenage girl serial killer

2166
01:50:16,064 --> 01:50:21,184
I don't think I've consumed this much alcohol for many years totally awesome

2167
01:50:21,952 --> 01:50:24,512
That's in the manifesto

2168
01:50:29,632 --> 01:50:30,912
No no

2169
01:50:31,424 --> 01:50:32,960
From January 2010

2170
01:50:33,216 --> 01:50:39,104
Has become notorious as a downloader of pirated movies series and Games Etc

2171
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:42,688
Increasing number of sites have been closed down lately

2172
01:50:42,944 --> 01:50:44,992
Stealing is bad I even made

2173
01:50:45,248 --> 01:50:49,088
When you've devoted your entire life to a good cause you can allow yourself some naughtiness

2174
01:50:49,344 --> 01:50:50,112
Especially if it

2175
01:50:50,368 --> 01:50:51,648
Can contribute to your lack of funds

2176
01:50:51,904 --> 01:50:52,416
Off

2177
01:50:52,672 --> 01:50:54,464
Yes guess no one's perfect

2178
01:50:54,976 --> 01:50:55,488
Colon

2179
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:05,984
Multi-entry drama that plays out where he goes to Prague I share this isn't written entirely in ASCII format

2180
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:06,752
Might as well

2181
01:51:07,008 --> 01:51:07,520
No

2182
01:51:08,032 --> 01:51:09,312
Dude this is my favorite thing

2183
01:51:10,336 --> 01:51:11,616
I want to say like

2184
01:51:12,384 --> 01:51:14,944
I don't want to like us often and make light this

2185
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:16,224
Horrible horrible person

2186
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:18,528
But if you actually read this diary

2187
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:20,832
You get a glimpse of a really pathetic dude

2188
01:51:21,344 --> 01:51:22,368
And I think that's a part of it

2189
01:51:22,624 --> 01:51:24,928
Now but hold on

2190
01:51:25,184 --> 01:51:30,048
And this is something we talked about pre-show as to whether or not it should be brought up

2191
01:51:30,304 --> 01:51:31,840
In our in our car

2192
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:33,632
But

2193
01:51:33,888 --> 01:51:36,192
If you want to go with a further parallel

2194
01:51:36,704 --> 01:51:37,728
Find it

2195
01:51:37,984 --> 01:51:39,520
Hard not to

2196
01:51:40,032 --> 01:51:42,080
Put this together with Alex Jones watch

2197
01:51:43,616 --> 01:51:46,176
Well you know what I'm saying

2198
01:51:46,432 --> 01:51:49,248
Before we got on here

2199
01:51:49,504 --> 01:51:52,576
Come up I don't have a real comment on it

2200
01:51:53,088 --> 01:51:55,136
Talk about it

2201
01:51:55,392 --> 01:51:56,160
Percy is meaningless to

2202
01:51:56,416 --> 01:51:57,184
Do people with no shame

2203
01:51:57,440 --> 01:51:59,488
ITunes

2204
01:51:59,744 --> 01:52:04,864
To focus on

2205
01:52:05,376 --> 01:52:11,520
Doesn't charm was like you know what let's just

2206
01:52:11,776 --> 01:52:17,920
Let this one go everybody else can dunk on him the way that they want until you brought it up within the context of this guy

2207
01:52:18,176 --> 01:52:18,688
Guys weird

2208
01:52:18,944 --> 01:52:20,736
Manifesto diary

2209
01:52:20,992 --> 01:52:25,344
Including all of this like all of this s*** that I espouse

2210
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:28,928
You still got to get your rocks off

2211
01:52:29,184 --> 01:52:31,232
Like that to me is that concept

2212
01:52:31,488 --> 01:52:33,536
You should hold on to that talk

2213
01:52:37,888 --> 01:52:41,472
No not a quote with a smiley face with tongue out

2214
01:52:42,496 --> 01:52:46,080
That idea that you're expressing is going you're going to get matter at a later

2215
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:49,152
As we get to

2216
01:52:49,408 --> 01:52:55,040
Is there is anything funny

2217
01:52:56,064 --> 01:52:57,344
And that is a Thursday multi

2218
01:52:57,856 --> 01:53:00,416
Drama that plays at work goes to Prague to buy weapon

2219
01:53:01,184 --> 01:53:04,768
Because he saw a BBC special about how they're a lot of hardened criminals in Prague

2220
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:07,840
It starts with him talking about his fears of being killed

2221
01:53:08,352 --> 01:53:10,144
With transition sent to him being surprised

2222
01:53:13,728 --> 01:53:14,240
Police lights

2223
01:53:14,496 --> 01:53:17,056
Hey there aren't any Muslims walking around

2224
01:53:19,104 --> 01:53:21,664
He ultimately failed to find any guns

2225
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:22,688
To buy in Prague

2226
01:53:22,944 --> 01:53:23,968
But reassure himself

2227
01:53:24,224 --> 01:53:25,504
Regardless of the outcome

2228
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:26,272
This mission

2229
01:53:26,528 --> 01:53:29,600
Other great vacation

2230
01:53:29,856 --> 01:53:34,208
A lot of amazing architecture I've also partied a lot with people

2231
01:53:34,464 --> 01:53:36,256
Sonia get on a plane Keller

2232
01:53:39,328 --> 01:53:40,352
He also talks about f******

2233
01:53:40,608 --> 01:53:42,656
Two girls while he's in Prague because he was afraid

2234
01:53:42,912 --> 01:53:44,192
He's going to die on that trip

2235
01:53:45,472 --> 01:53:45,984
Really

2236
01:53:46,496 --> 01:53:50,336
Really want to make this clear he's Dona do not do anything like that

2237
01:53:50,592 --> 01:53:56,480
Please oh my God I don't want to eat them if you want it to look I don't want to be that guy

2238
01:53:56,736 --> 01:54:00,832
I don't want a specific like give give like no

2239
01:54:01,088 --> 01:54:03,648
He's like I thought these two girls in Prague

2240
01:54:03,904 --> 01:54:09,536
I know that I do that's not my kind of thing but like I might have it on this trip so I got a phuc

2241
01:54:09,792 --> 01:54:10,304
Dude

2242
01:54:10,816 --> 01:54:11,328
Just

2243
01:54:11,584 --> 01:54:14,144
Truckin live your life stop it with this s***

2244
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:16,448
From a November 2010 post

2245
01:54:16,704 --> 01:54:18,496
I'm currently watching Dexter

2246
01:54:19,008 --> 01:54:21,824
The series is about a forensic mass murderer hilarious

2247
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:23,616
I'm also playing

2248
01:54:23,872 --> 01:54:26,432
I'm also playing Fallout 3 New Vegas at the moment

2249
01:54:26,688 --> 01:54:28,480
After finishing BioShock 2

2250
01:54:28,736 --> 01:54:32,320
I'm going to try the New World of Warcraft cataclysm when it's released in December

2251
01:54:32,576 --> 01:54:34,368
Time to dust off my made

2252
01:54:37,184 --> 01:54:41,792
Manifesto is legitimately gamergate writ large

2253
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:44,352
The dates match

2254
01:54:45,632 --> 01:54:47,424
2011

2255
01:54:47,936 --> 01:54:53,312
I don't know I'd probably more like 2013.

2256
01:54:56,384 --> 01:54:58,176
Aquage again not to

2257
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:03,040
But that's subsection

2258
01:55:03,296 --> 01:55:06,112
Of like that toxic masculinity

2259
01:55:06,368 --> 01:55:08,672
As it applies to any kind of nerd culture

2260
01:55:10,464 --> 01:55:11,744
A being a

2261
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,560
What's fascinating

2262
01:55:18,912 --> 01:55:19,424
In the

2263
01:55:21,216 --> 01:55:24,288
Mass Killers there's always assertive anger or violence

2264
01:55:25,312 --> 01:55:28,896
And I'm not entirely sure but I'm not sure I actually see

2265
01:55:30,432 --> 01:55:32,224
But as I've already mentioned

2266
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:34,272
He specifically talks about his mom

2267
01:55:34,528 --> 01:55:35,808
And his sister having St

2268
01:55:39,648 --> 01:55:44,512
Actual domestic violence

2269
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:48,352
No one ever proved why

2270
01:55:48,608 --> 01:55:50,400
Masculinity is worse

2271
01:55:51,168 --> 01:55:52,960
Then people who

2272
01:55:53,216 --> 01:55:56,800
Xzibit the idea that masculinity is great for it

2273
01:55:57,056 --> 01:55:59,616
Yeah

2274
01:55:59,872 --> 01:56:00,896
Message from this journal

2275
01:56:01,152 --> 01:56:05,504
Entry in his Manifesto

2276
01:56:06,016 --> 01:56:10,880
No that was from his lawsuit against the piskies

2277
01:56:11,136 --> 01:56:12,672
Yeah I don't like my route

2278
01:56:12,928 --> 01:56:19,072
Blizzard I've got a PlayStation 2 I can't get any of the f****** Mario game voicemail

2279
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:29,824
It's reasonable directly that proves your point entirely

2280
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:32,384
Got that we weren't talking about Alex in this point

2281
01:56:33,664 --> 01:56:34,688
Specifically in his lawsuit

2282
01:56:34,944 --> 01:56:35,456
Complained about

2283
01:56:37,504 --> 01:56:38,016
Rayman

2284
01:56:38,528 --> 01:56:40,064
Rayman isn't

2285
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:41,088
That's probably what

2286
01:56:44,928 --> 01:56:46,720
Relationship

2287
01:56:47,232 --> 01:56:49,792
Locate my plans and may jeopardize my operation

2288
01:56:50,304 --> 01:56:56,448
And I don't feel comfortable manipulating girls anymore into one nightstand I'm not the person I'm not that person anymore

2289
01:56:57,472 --> 01:57:00,032
Girls in Prague this is where

2290
01:57:00,544 --> 01:57:01,312
I brought this up already

2291
01:57:01,568 --> 01:57:03,360
Girls in Prague though

2292
01:57:03,616 --> 01:57:08,224
But that was mainly because it was a realistic chance that I would end up dead during the process of establishing

2293
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:09,504
Weapons connection

2294
01:57:10,016 --> 01:57:16,160
I won't make any effort to try and completely justify it though human males are imperfect by default in their plague by there by

2295
01:57:16,416 --> 01:57:17,184
Biological needs

2296
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:23,328
Nevertheless screwing around outside of marriage is after all the relatively small Cent compared to the huge amounts of Grace

2297
01:57:23,584 --> 01:57:25,888
I'm about to generate with my martyrdom operation

2298
01:57:26,144 --> 01:57:27,168
Couldn't hold on

2299
01:57:27,680 --> 01:57:28,448
It is essential

2300
01:57:28,704 --> 01:57:29,984
You do what is required

2301
01:57:30,240 --> 01:57:32,032
To keep morale and motivation at high-level

2302
01:57:32,544 --> 01:57:34,592
Especially just prior to operation critical mama

2303
01:57:35,104 --> 01:57:40,992
I reserved two thousand Euro from my operations budget

2304
01:57:41,248 --> 01:57:43,040
One week prior to execution of the mission

2305
01:57:43,552 --> 01:57:48,416
I'll probably arrange that just before after I attend by final Martyrs mass at frogner church

2306
01:57:48,672 --> 01:57:50,464
It will contribute to ease my mind

2307
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:52,512
Play imagine I will be tense and very nervous

2308
01:57:52,768 --> 01:57:54,048
It's easier to face death if

2309
01:57:54,304 --> 01:57:56,864
If you know your biologically mentally and spiritually

2310
01:57:58,656 --> 01:57:59,168
Now

2311
01:57:59,936 --> 01:58:00,704
By no means

2312
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:03,520
Am I disparaging the sex worker

2313
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:06,848
Nor the people who search them out

2314
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:08,896
Any number of possible reason

2315
01:58:09,152 --> 01:58:09,920
Knotel ever

2316
01:58:10,176 --> 01:58:14,016
In your Manifesto about how the patriarchy

2317
01:58:14,272 --> 01:58:15,296
Please don't

2318
01:58:15,552 --> 01:58:18,624
F****** elucidate why the patriarchy is terrible

2319
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:19,648
Sprite and then also

2320
01:58:25,024 --> 01:58:25,792
I do f******

2321
01:58:26,048 --> 01:58:26,560
Horrible is

2322
01:58:26,816 --> 01:58:28,096
Is it to put that sex worker

2323
01:58:29,120 --> 01:58:30,400
Like she doesn't know that

2324
01:58:30,656 --> 01:58:31,680
Context of all this

2325
01:58:31,936 --> 01:58:36,032
The idea may be a couple weeks later

2326
01:58:36,288 --> 01:58:40,128
That she murdered

2327
01:58:40,384 --> 01:58:42,432
F****** god unfair to

2328
01:58:42,688 --> 01:58:43,712
To her I don't

2329
01:58:44,224 --> 01:58:44,736
I don't

2330
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:47,552
Smaller

2331
01:58:48,064 --> 01:58:54,208
Totally agree with you I had a visceral response is much smaller than

2332
01:58:55,744 --> 01:58:58,560
Unsurprising

2333
01:58:58,816 --> 01:58:59,328
Pieces of in

2334
01:58:59,584 --> 01:59:00,864
Information to resign from his journal

2335
01:59:01,376 --> 01:59:02,912
Here's a revelation that he makes

2336
01:59:09,568 --> 01:59:12,128
4 years ago in 2006 just before I started writing this

2337
01:59:12,384 --> 01:59:12,896
Compendium

2338
01:59:13,152 --> 01:59:18,016
I decided to move for my apartment in frogner one of the most

2339
01:59:20,832 --> 01:59:21,600
Compendium

2340
01:59:21,856 --> 01:59:22,368
Is attack

2341
01:59:26,464 --> 01:59:32,096
Initiate cycle weeks

2342
01:59:32,352 --> 01:59:34,656
Followed by three weeks of dbol tabs

2343
01:59:34,912 --> 01:59:35,424
40 mg

2344
01:59:35,680 --> 01:59:38,496
Verde 86 kg

2345
01:59:39,776 --> 01:59:41,056
No side effects cycle

2346
01:59:41,312 --> 01:59:41,824
Completed

2347
01:59:42,592 --> 01:59:44,640
I've never in my life been more physically

2348
01:59:47,456 --> 01:59:48,736
2% which will prove useful

2349
01:59:49,248 --> 01:59:50,272
There's a bunch of insta

2350
01:59:50,528 --> 01:59:52,320
I'm talking about his

2351
01:59:52,576 --> 01:59:56,672
And even beyond that he talks about stacking

2352
01:59:57,440 --> 01:59:57,952
Ephedrine

2353
01:59:58,208 --> 02:00:00,000
Caffeine

2354
02:00:00,256 --> 02:00:03,584
Just sort of over-the-counter speed

2355
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:04,352
The entire time

2356
02:00:04,864 --> 02:00:05,888
Which does

2357
02:00:06,144 --> 02:00:07,424
You know if you look at the time

2358
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:08,192
As off

2359
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:09,728
Increase

2360
02:00:10,240 --> 02:00:11,520
Parallel with

2361
02:00:12,032 --> 02:00:12,544
Sort of delusion

2362
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:15,360
Manic

2363
02:00:15,616 --> 02:00:16,128
Surveillance

2364
02:00:16,384 --> 02:00:17,920
Yeah all that sort of stuff really makes

2365
02:00:18,432 --> 02:00:20,736
Uuu Serta Parts through

2366
02:00:20,992 --> 02:00:22,016
The little details

2367
02:00:23,296 --> 02:00:24,576
Crystal clear

2368
02:00:25,856 --> 02:00:26,368
Entrenched big

2369
02:00:26,624 --> 02:00:27,904
He already has

2370
02:00:28,672 --> 02:00:29,184
The diminished

2371
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:29,952
Capabilities

2372
02:00:30,208 --> 02:00:30,720
Capacity

2373
02:00:30,976 --> 02:00:31,744
He has based on his

2374
02:00:32,256 --> 02:00:33,024
Drug use

2375
02:00:33,536 --> 02:00:35,840
The clear psychopath e video

2376
02:00:36,096 --> 02:00:37,120
He has thing you can just

2377
02:00:37,376 --> 02:00:38,656
Squeem from his own right

2378
02:00:39,680 --> 02:00:42,240
But I think more importantly is all the

2379
02:00:42,496 --> 02:00:43,264
Very 121

2380
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:44,544
Unparalleled

2381
02:00:45,824 --> 02:00:46,336
It is

2382
02:00:46,848 --> 02:00:47,360
Strange

2383
02:00:47,872 --> 02:00:49,408
Tumi like anytime

2384
02:00:49,664 --> 02:00:50,176
You tossed that

2385
02:00:52,736 --> 02:00:54,272
It does absolutely

2386
02:00:56,576 --> 02:00:57,088
Right

2387
02:00:58,368 --> 02:00:59,136
Is terrifying

2388
02:01:00,416 --> 02:01:00,928
Because

2389
02:01:01,952 --> 02:01:02,976
Somebody who

2390
02:01:03,232 --> 02:01:04,768
Up until I was

2391
02:01:05,024 --> 02:01:06,560
Properly medicated at

2392
02:01:06,816 --> 02:01:07,840
Like what

2393
02:01:08,096 --> 02:01:09,632
Experienced consistent

2394
02:01:11,424 --> 02:01:13,216
So you you look at that

2395
02:01:13,472 --> 02:01:15,264
And you see the possibility

2396
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:16,032
Of

2397
02:01:16,288 --> 02:01:17,824
If I had those thoughts

2398
02:01:18,336 --> 02:01:22,432
It's entirely possible that I would have committed some sort of

2399
02:01:22,944 --> 02:01:29,088
Absolutely not on Pain Scale

2400
02:01:32,416 --> 02:01:34,208
Really terrifying

2401
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:35,232
Note

2402
02:01:35,744 --> 02:01:36,256
Fat

2403
02:01:36,512 --> 02:01:37,024
Epi

2404
02:01:37,280 --> 02:01:39,840
Truly at the end of the day

2405
02:01:40,864 --> 02:01:41,632
This is a

2406
02:01:41,888 --> 02:01:42,400
Green

2407
02:01:45,728 --> 02:01:48,032
This is this is this is a disease

2408
02:01:49,568 --> 02:01:52,896
I don't know and so you like

2409
02:01:53,408 --> 02:01:56,224
He's like that

2410
02:01:56,480 --> 02:01:57,504
To be honest

2411
02:01:58,272 --> 02:01:59,808
The thing that I come away from his

2412
02:02:00,064 --> 02:02:00,832
This is unavoidable

2413
02:02:01,088 --> 02:02:04,672
Like I don't I don't mean that to be like no absolutely

2414
02:02:04,928 --> 02:02:05,440
No

2415
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:09,792
Willingness

2416
02:02:10,304 --> 02:02:11,328
Consider this

2417
02:02:11,584 --> 02:02:13,120
The thoughts he was having

2418
02:02:15,424 --> 02:02:15,936
The place

2419
02:02:16,192 --> 02:02:16,960
The fact that you kept

2420
02:02:17,472 --> 02:02:17,984
Himself

2421
02:02:18,752 --> 02:02:19,776
Exactly document

2422
02:02:21,312 --> 02:02:22,336
City limits

2423
02:02:22,848 --> 02:02:24,896
He's unable to

2424
02:02:25,152 --> 02:02:25,920
Anyone else

2425
02:02:26,176 --> 02:02:26,688
Who's playing

2426
02:02:26,944 --> 02:02:28,480
Bring people into the fold

2427
02:02:28,736 --> 02:02:29,760
Yeah

2428
02:02:30,016 --> 02:02:31,296
The fact that he

2429
02:02:32,064 --> 02:02:32,576
This sort of thing

2430
02:02:32,832 --> 02:02:34,112
I really don't think that

2431
02:02:34,624 --> 02:02:35,392
Anything you can do

2432
02:02:35,904 --> 02:02:36,672
Can mitigate

2433
02:02:36,928 --> 02:02:37,440
Someone like

2434
02:02:38,464 --> 02:02:40,512
Yeah because

2435
02:02:41,024 --> 02:02:41,536
You know

2436
02:02:41,792 --> 02:02:42,304
The people with

2437
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:43,584
Mental illness there's help

2438
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:46,656
For you if you're willing to get it I would love to

2439
02:02:46,912 --> 02:02:48,192
Sickness opportunity

2440
02:02:48,448 --> 02:02:49,216
To get on a soapbox

2441
02:02:49,472 --> 02:02:49,984
Some say like

2442
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:50,752
If only

2443
02:02:51,008 --> 02:02:51,776
Only someone were there

2444
02:02:52,032 --> 02:02:53,312
To help him at XYZ time

2445
02:02:53,568 --> 02:02:55,872
Stuff that I read

2446
02:02:56,384 --> 02:02:58,176
His writings that I've read

2447
02:02:58,688 --> 02:03:01,248
I don't think that he would never have sought out that

2448
02:03:02,272 --> 02:03:02,784
If possible

2449
02:03:03,552 --> 02:03:04,320
I'm like

2450
02:03:04,576 --> 02:03:05,856
Like maybe when he was twelve or so

2451
02:03:06,368 --> 02:03:09,184
Yeah

2452
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:10,208
Earlier

2453
02:03:10,464 --> 02:03:11,232
Then people

2454
02:03:11,488 --> 02:03:12,000
Generally

2455
02:03:12,512 --> 02:03:18,656
Think we didn't once against goes back to Alex's rhetoric and I know that

2456
02:03:18,912 --> 02:03:22,752
Play like that going to neuter you

2457
02:03:23,008 --> 02:03:25,568
They're going to destroy what you think

2458
02:03:25,824 --> 02:03:28,128
Is AAA

2459
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:31,968
And what in reality they're going to do is actually f******

2460
02:03:32,224 --> 02:03:33,248
Can help you be a human

2461
02:03:33,760 --> 02:03:35,040
Instead of a month

2462
02:03:35,296 --> 02:03:37,088
Find some sort of

2463
02:03:37,344 --> 02:03:37,856
Integration

2464
02:03:39,904 --> 02:03:40,416
Face reality

2465
02:03:40,928 --> 02:03:41,440
Yeah

2466
02:03:41,696 --> 02:03:42,464
That sort of thing

2467
02:03:42,720 --> 02:03:43,488
I don't know man

2468
02:03:44,768 --> 02:03:46,304
Huge bummer I don't

2469
02:03:47,072 --> 02:03:47,584
I don't think

2470
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:48,864
Of course

2471
02:03:49,120 --> 02:03:49,632
I don't say

2472
02:03:49,888 --> 02:03:50,912
Mental illness

2473
02:03:53,216 --> 02:03:54,240
In the same way that I do

2474
02:03:54,496 --> 02:03:55,264
Think that the rhetoric

2475
02:03:56,544 --> 02:03:57,056
Narrative

2476
02:03:57,568 --> 02:03:58,848
Other very similar to ours

2477
02:03:59,872 --> 02:04:00,896
Narrative

2478
02:04:01,152 --> 02:04:01,664
0-100

2479
02:04:02,176 --> 02:04:03,200
Santa blame for his eye

2480
02:04:03,712 --> 02:04:04,224
There's a

2481
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:05,760
Complicated bouillabaisse

2482
02:04:06,016 --> 02:04:06,784
Is going on here

2483
02:04:09,600 --> 02:04:10,880
And the only reason that I think

2484
02:04:12,928 --> 02:04:13,440
M2r

2485
02:04:13,952 --> 02:04:14,464
Stop

2486
02:04:14,720 --> 02:04:15,232
Is that

2487
02:04:15,744 --> 02:04:16,768
The narratives are the

2488
02:04:17,024 --> 02:04:17,536
The part that you can

2489
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:19,072
Yeah

2490
02:04:21,888 --> 02:04:24,192
Mostly upon you

2491
02:04:24,448 --> 02:04:25,472
Yeah

2492
02:04:25,984 --> 02:04:27,008
Did we can't help people

2493
02:04:28,032 --> 02:04:28,800
Encourage people to

2494
02:04:29,824 --> 02:04:32,384
Stop saying your b*******

2495
02:04:32,640 --> 02:04:33,920
If you feel you need help

2496
02:04:34,176 --> 02:04:34,944
2 gold chain

2497
02:04:35,200 --> 02:04:37,248
Surprise yourself of the help that's available

2498
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:39,040
If you've been married

2499
02:04:39,808 --> 02:04:41,344
The narratives in the rhetoric or the park

2500
02:04:43,136 --> 02:04:44,160
We can talk about this

2501
02:04:44,928 --> 02:04:45,440
It's all bulshit

2502
02:04:46,720 --> 02:04:47,232
So

2503
02:04:47,488 --> 02:04:48,000
Now we get back to the

2504
02:04:50,816 --> 02:04:51,840
I forgot we were doing the show

2505
02:04:53,632 --> 02:04:54,400
We have now started

2506
02:04:54,656 --> 02:04:55,168
Gotten into

2507
02:04:55,680 --> 02:04:56,448
Exactly what mode

2508
02:04:57,728 --> 02:04:58,496
Tyrone Davis

2509
02:05:03,104 --> 02:05:03,872
And now Alex

2510
02:05:05,408 --> 02:05:05,920
Saying that it

2511
02:05:12,064 --> 02:05:15,648
Please rashemi believe the person responsible the bomb

2512
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:28,704
I wish we could arrest you

2513
02:05:29,472 --> 02:05:32,288
When they come out

2514
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:36,128
Anime show the white people

2515
02:05:39,456 --> 02:05:39,968
Address

2516
02:05:44,832 --> 02:05:50,976
White tiger

2517
02:06:02,752 --> 02:06:04,800
White tiger

2518
02:06:05,312 --> 02:06:06,592
Call Jay Nelson

2519
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:09,664
Strawman

2520
02:06:09,920 --> 02:06:11,200
The DHS

2521
02:06:12,736 --> 02:06:13,760
The only thing you could process

2522
02:06:14,784 --> 02:06:15,552
Back to is like

2523
02:06:15,808 --> 02:06:17,600
Years prior there's a John Walker

2524
02:06:20,672 --> 02:06:25,536
Is avocado or the or they're like

2525
02:06:25,792 --> 02:06:26,304
2001

2526
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:31,936
But there are a couple instances of Park.

2527
02:06:32,192 --> 02:06:33,728
You know a couple of

2528
02:06:33,984 --> 02:06:35,008
Girls who are like

2529
02:06:35,264 --> 02:06:39,872
19 who was thinking that it was

2530
02:06:41,408 --> 02:06:43,200
But but

2531
02:06:43,456 --> 02:06:44,992
Other the bouillabaisse

2532
02:06:45,504 --> 02:06:47,808
Like they're does require a certain

2533
02:06:48,832 --> 02:06:50,368
Perfect Storm

2534
02:06:50,624 --> 02:06:51,904
Factors that go into this

2535
02:06:52,416 --> 02:06:54,976
Otherwise we would see this whole f****** lot more

2536
02:06:56,256 --> 02:06:56,768
Look

2537
02:06:57,280 --> 02:06:59,840
There are 7 billion people on this dump

2538
02:07:00,096 --> 02:07:03,424
Stupid f****** planet they better are that we're destroying

2539
02:07:04,192 --> 02:07:05,472
It is it is it leads

2540
02:07:06,496 --> 02:07:09,056
Positive

2541
02:07:09,312 --> 02:07:10,080
It seems like

2542
02:07:10,592 --> 02:07:12,896
Out of 7 billion people

2543
02:07:13,152 --> 02:07:16,736
To generate this kind of level of

2544
02:07:16,992 --> 02:07:18,016
Psychopath monster

2545
02:07:18,784 --> 02:07:20,832
I don't know I don't know if that's cold

2546
02:07:21,344 --> 02:07:22,368
Yeah yeah

2547
02:07:22,624 --> 02:07:23,392
F****** s***

2548
02:07:23,648 --> 02:07:24,160
Yeah

2549
02:07:24,416 --> 02:07:25,952
I don't know there was only like

2550
02:07:26,208 --> 02:07:26,720
Six hundred

2551
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,048
So much longer to go see now you're talkin

2552
02:07:30,304 --> 02:07:32,096
Globalist

2553
02:07:32,352 --> 02:07:37,984
Georgia Guidestones Rudy globalist

2554
02:07:38,240 --> 02:07:44,384
Maybe the bad guys in kingsman the Secret Service just went about it the wrong way

2555
02:07:48,480 --> 02:07:51,040
Well that's because Samuel Jackson was the main bad guy

2556
02:07:51,296 --> 02:07:52,064
Is black Salve course

2557
02:07:52,576 --> 02:07:55,648
Idris Elba can't be gone

2558
02:07:58,720 --> 02:08:04,864
Did that last Clippers Joe weird shall we do his nuts

2559
02:08:05,120 --> 02:08:07,424
To do the show

2560
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:08,448
Respect

2561
02:08:08,704 --> 02:08:14,848
Hours now talking about Anders Breivik

2562
02:08:15,104 --> 02:08:19,712
What the f*** are we doing

2563
02:08:20,224 --> 02:08:23,552
Yikes so I'm the reason that that last

2564
02:08:23,808 --> 02:08:24,832
Is particularly important

2565
02:08:25,600 --> 02:08:26,624
Is because Alex Jones

2566
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:29,184
Gets a lot of mileage out of this

2567
02:08:29,440 --> 02:08:30,208
Al-Qaeda

2568
02:08:31,744 --> 02:08:37,376
I agree like I said better portmanteau but he says why you don't cry too so we have to go

2569
02:08:37,632 --> 02:08:39,424
You're further to like white Ida

2570
02:08:39,936 --> 02:08:42,752
You're that you're close to

2571
02:08:43,776 --> 02:08:49,920
That's too close

2572
02:08:51,712 --> 02:08:53,248
See there we go

2573
02:08:53,504 --> 02:08:57,600
Marvel

2574
02:08:57,856 --> 02:09:04,000
I know how to use citric I can write a script

2575
02:09:04,512 --> 02:09:10,656
Where is Starbucks is let's do this. I got a couple of friends who

2576
02:09:14,240 --> 02:09:17,824
Yeah it's really important

2577
02:09:18,080 --> 02:09:20,128
To me is that he gets a lot of mileage

2578
02:09:21,152 --> 02:09:22,176
Did he usually uses

2579
02:09:22,432 --> 02:09:23,456
Because

2580
02:09:23,712 --> 02:09:28,064
About white al-Qaeda in that last clip very clear

2581
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:29,600
What are you talkin about is white

2582
02:09:29,856 --> 02:09:30,880
People joining Al-Qaeda

2583
02:09:31,648 --> 02:09:33,184
And that is the colonel and that's

2584
02:09:33,440 --> 02:09:33,952
General

2585
02:09:35,232 --> 02:09:39,328
However later later as time goes on

2586
02:09:39,584 --> 02:09:41,120
You repurpose that term

2587
02:09:41,376 --> 02:09:44,448
Into being away to mock the idea of right-wing

2588
02:09:45,728 --> 02:09:46,496
Yeah

2589
02:09:49,824 --> 02:09:51,360
Right

2590
02:09:51,616 --> 02:09:56,736
In that Westcliff clear he's specifically talking about white people joining up with

2591
02:09:56,992 --> 02:09:57,504
Qaida

2592
02:09:57,760 --> 02:09:59,552
Which is what the globalist are doing to make

2593
02:09:59,808 --> 02:10:03,392
Everyone's scared of people

2594
02:10:03,648 --> 02:10:05,440
That's the narrative

2595
02:10:05,696 --> 02:10:06,976
Which is plenty

2596
02:10:07,488 --> 02:10:08,000
I'm pretty bad

2597
02:10:08,512 --> 02:10:10,816
Especially considering the truth

2598
02:10:11,072 --> 02:10:12,352
That we know about this attack

2599
02:10:12,608 --> 02:10:14,400
Which was primarily motivated

2600
02:10:14,656 --> 02:10:16,704
Buy a guy hates Muslims

2601
02:10:18,240 --> 02:10:19,776
A group that could be described similar

2602
02:10:20,288 --> 02:10:22,592
The globalist is helping them overrun Europe

2603
02:10:23,872 --> 02:10:24,384
Alex Jones

2604
02:10:26,688 --> 02:10:27,456
The West

2605
02:10:31,552 --> 02:10:33,344
We got to we got to

2606
02:10:33,600 --> 02:10:34,880
Man

2607
02:10:37,440 --> 02:10:37,952
The rest of them

2608
02:10:40,256 --> 02:10:42,048
This is one of my favorite like the directions

2609
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:43,072
What

2610
02:10:43,328 --> 02:10:43,840
No

2611
02:10:44,096 --> 02:10:46,912
That movie North is a mess

2612
02:10:48,704 --> 02:10:49,216
Stop

2613
02:10:58,176 --> 02:11:01,760
Look to do with set you up

2614
02:11:02,528 --> 02:11:08,672
You're you're consistently funnier than me my job is just to remind you to be funny I'm often

2615
02:11:08,928 --> 02:11:10,464
Accidentally funny

2616
02:11:10,976 --> 02:11:11,744
Never been prouder than

2617
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:12,768
The one I called

2618
02:11:13,792 --> 02:11:16,352
Merle Haggard a muppet

2619
02:11:16,864 --> 02:11:18,656
Next clip

2620
02:11:18,912 --> 02:11:23,008
Is one of my favorite things in the world

2621
02:11:23,264 --> 02:11:24,544
She running operation

2622
02:11:25,056 --> 02:11:25,568
Because

2623
02:11:25,824 --> 02:11:27,872
You just do business meeting on air

2624
02:11:28,128 --> 02:11:28,640
Basically

2625
02:11:28,896 --> 02:11:31,200
He knows the Paul Joseph Watson

2626
02:11:31,712 --> 02:11:32,992
It's probably going to do a better job

2627
02:11:33,248 --> 02:11:33,760
About being a

2628
02:11:34,272 --> 02:11:36,320
What about stuff at least

2629
02:11:36,576 --> 02:11:38,368
Paul Joseph Watson

2630
02:11:38,880 --> 02:11:42,720
But forgets to put them on speaker

2631
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:49,120
Paul Joseph Watson

2632
02:11:49,632 --> 02:11:52,448
He is you might as well be on a bus with him

2633
02:11:52,704 --> 02:11:57,056
And only listening to his side of the conversation

2634
02:11:57,312 --> 02:11:58,080
Alex Jones

2635
02:11:58,336 --> 02:12:02,176
Because what he's doing is a business meeting on air with Paul Joseph Watson

2636
02:12:02,688 --> 02:12:06,272
Trying to spin the narrative that they want to put out on the website

2637
02:12:06,528 --> 02:12:09,088
Without Paul Joseph Watson

2638
02:12:09,344 --> 02:12:11,392
I don't know why he didn't do this

2639
02:12:11,648 --> 02:12:12,928
In the commercial break

2640
02:12:13,184 --> 02:12:16,000
But he's clearly coming out

2641
02:12:16,256 --> 02:12:17,536
But whatever the case

2642
02:12:17,792 --> 02:12:19,328
Here is Alex Jones being

2643
02:12:19,584 --> 02:12:22,144
The worst f****** content producer in the world

2644
02:12:30,336 --> 02:12:36,480
Running around shooting

2645
02:12:41,344 --> 02:12:44,416
The show

2646
02:12:44,672 --> 02:12:45,696
It's late in the show

2647
02:12:45,952 --> 02:12:48,512
So I don't know exactly all of the news

2648
02:12:48,768 --> 02:12:50,048
Come out but he's already

2649
02:12:50,304 --> 02:12:52,864
Dealing with it as like coordinated but separate attack

2650
02:12:53,376 --> 02:12:56,192
When it was the same guy

2651
02:12:58,240 --> 02:13:01,312
Wide as the bankers and plugs

2652
02:13:05,152 --> 02:13:05,664
Watson

2653
02:13:08,224 --> 02:13:09,504
Hey there buddy

2654
02:13:11,296 --> 02:13:17,440
Call John Mayer

2655
02:13:17,696 --> 02:13:20,000
Tracking

2656
02:13:23,072 --> 02:13:24,864
But obviously

2657
02:13:35,104 --> 02:13:36,384
Precision Productions

2658
02:13:40,736 --> 02:13:44,576
And that whatever

2659
02:13:44,832 --> 02:13:47,136
Shootings and bombings in Europe

2660
02:13:54,560 --> 02:13:59,936
Schedule for over a year with precision

2661
02:14:00,448 --> 02:14:04,288
What is an absolute emergency

2662
02:14:06,336 --> 02:14:11,456
In Norway

2663
02:14:11,968 --> 02:14:15,808
I mean this is just absolutely off-the-charts

2664
02:14:16,064 --> 02:14:18,880
I believe this is the beginning

2665
02:14:28,608 --> 02:14:31,168
Schleich Homeland others

2666
02:14:31,680 --> 02:14:36,800
Affair

2667
02:14:37,568 --> 02:14:38,336
It's just

2668
02:14:52,416 --> 02:14:55,232
What I'd like to contacts

2669
02:14:55,488 --> 02:14:56,512
Is that

2670
02:15:00,096 --> 02:15:06,240
White Al-Qaeda on speakerphone

2671
02:15:06,496 --> 02:15:08,288
Pillow talk with him

2672
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:13,152
Amazon and they can't even get to selling gold Alex tries a couple times it doesn't

2673
02:15:14,432 --> 02:15:17,504
News

2674
02:15:19,040 --> 02:15:20,320
Call from someone in Norway

2675
02:15:20,576 --> 02:15:21,088
It was a listener

2676
02:15:21,344 --> 02:15:22,112
Who was there

2677
02:15:23,136 --> 02:15:23,648
The bomb

2678
02:15:23,904 --> 02:15:24,672
Sears nearby

2679
02:15:24,928 --> 02:15:27,744
And how does

2680
02:15:28,768 --> 02:15:32,096
Norwegian

2681
02:15:32,352 --> 02:15:37,472
Situation

2682
02:15:37,728 --> 02:15:38,752
Norwegian

2683
02:15:39,008 --> 02:15:43,616
But this guy just counting of the fact

2684
02:15:43,872 --> 02:15:46,688
Who's the new prime minister

2685
02:15:46,944 --> 02:15:48,480
Spell extremes over in and tries to

2686
02:15:59,488 --> 02:16:00,768
Is good evening

2687
02:16:01,280 --> 02:16:03,840
But I like Glimpse in that last clip

2688
02:16:04,096 --> 02:16:06,144
Because what we see is what production

2689
02:16:06,912 --> 02:16:07,680
Being done on air

2690
02:16:07,936 --> 02:16:12,288
You can hear Alex being like all right here the propaganda points that we need to have to

2691
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:15,104
People love Precision predictions

2692
02:16:15,616 --> 02:16:18,176
And I've already decided this is white Al-Qaeda

2693
02:16:18,432 --> 02:16:22,784
I predicted that in the path

2694
02:16:23,040 --> 02:16:26,112
To make an article that sums all of this up

2695
02:16:26,624 --> 02:16:31,232
And make it make it look like I made a like a really amazing prediction even

2696
02:16:31,488 --> 02:16:32,000
I'm ignoring

2697
02:16:32,512 --> 02:16:35,840
The fact that details are still alive

2698
02:16:36,352 --> 02:16:38,656
Yeah but that's what this is how propaganda works

2699
02:16:38,912 --> 02:16:43,520
You're seeing how the sausage is made on air that was really

2700
02:16:43,776 --> 02:16:45,824
This is an embarrassing thing for him to

2701
02:16:49,152 --> 02:16:52,736
I'm so Ed hours have passed since he previously said

2702
02:16:53,760 --> 02:16:57,344
Yeah and by this point Michelle I'm not totally sure like another time

2703
02:16:57,600 --> 02:16:58,112
Stamp on it

2704
02:16:58,368 --> 02:16:59,904
The by the point we're at now

2705
02:17:00,160 --> 02:17:02,464
Well he said it was a false flag you didn't say it was

2706
02:17:02,720 --> 02:17:04,256
Which ones are crisis actors

2707
02:17:04,768 --> 02:17:08,864
Oh you did say it was staged so he said 98%

2708
02:17:09,120 --> 02:17:11,168
Real 90% chance of stage

2709
02:17:11,424 --> 02:17:15,008
Yeah but I think what you meant.

2710
02:17:15,264 --> 02:17:16,032
Happened

2711
02:17:16,288 --> 02:17:18,336
But it was a lie about

2712
02:17:18,592 --> 02:17:20,640
Howland and who perpetrated

2713
02:17:20,896 --> 02:17:21,408
Possibly

2714
02:17:21,920 --> 02:17:22,688
What we're doing

2715
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:23,712
Is

2716
02:17:23,968 --> 02:17:26,272
Being far too fair to like what he

2717
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:27,552
Right

2718
02:17:29,344 --> 02:17:30,112
But

2719
02:17:30,368 --> 02:17:30,880
It's now been hour

2720
02:17:32,416 --> 02:17:32,928
Point

2721
02:17:33,184 --> 02:17:33,696
It's all over

2722
02:17:33,952 --> 02:17:36,256
Yeah by this time that he's now on air

2723
02:17:36,512 --> 02:17:37,536
In the third hour of

2724
02:17:40,864 --> 02:17:41,632
In Norway

2725
02:17:42,144 --> 02:17:43,168
Anders Breivik

2726
02:17:44,448 --> 02:17:45,984
Latest weapons down in Pinterest

2727
02:17:47,008 --> 02:17:48,032
Presumably

2728
02:17:48,544 --> 02:17:50,848
The news reports are reporting that

2729
02:17:52,640 --> 02:17:55,712
Because we've already talked about the victim who was arrested as a

2730
02:17:55,968 --> 02:17:56,992
Supposed to

2731
02:17:57,504 --> 02:17:58,016
That

2732
02:17:58,272 --> 02:17:58,784
Fake news

2733
02:18:00,064 --> 02:18:02,624
Might be being reported so that's something

2734
02:18:02,880 --> 02:18:03,392
He should

2735
02:18:04,160 --> 02:18:10,304
Take a step back from but it's understandable if he wants to use that

2736
02:18:10,560 --> 02:18:14,400
Everything that guy in that moment

2737
02:18:15,168 --> 02:18:16,448
Because

2738
02:18:16,960 --> 02:18:19,520
If you're a cop

2739
02:18:19,776 --> 02:18:25,664
How could you possibly deal with this in a rational manner in the moment you know that's like that's like you're just

2740
02:18:25,920 --> 02:18:28,224
Just like

2741
02:18:28,480 --> 02:18:31,808
I see something I don't know what to do

2742
02:18:34,112 --> 02:18:34,624
I

2743
02:18:34,880 --> 02:18:37,952
Currently understand the mentality I hate the result

2744
02:18:39,488 --> 02:18:43,072
Have you want to do I'm like what

2745
02:18:43,328 --> 02:18:49,216
If you if you if you killed in the moment while you're on that island

2746
02:18:49,728 --> 02:18:50,496
He's a hero

2747
02:18:50,752 --> 02:18:53,056
He's a martyr he's really a Mustang

2748
02:18:53,312 --> 02:18:54,336
If you

2749
02:18:54,848 --> 02:18:56,128
Give him a PlayStation

2750
02:18:56,384 --> 02:18:56,896
3

2751
02:18:57,408 --> 02:18:58,432
What what do you got

2752
02:18:59,200 --> 02:18:59,712
What do you got

2753
02:19:00,224 --> 02:19:02,784
Who's the bigger who's the bigger person

2754
02:19:04,320 --> 02:19:06,368
Who proves what Society should

2755
02:19:06,624 --> 02:19:09,184
More than the country that is like

2756
02:19:10,464 --> 02:19:10,976
You're a

2757
02:19:11,232 --> 02:19:15,328
F****** monster and we will still treat you like a

2758
02:19:15,584 --> 02:19:18,144
A human being that's one of the points that I had hoped to get to

2759
02:19:18,400 --> 02:19:22,240
Is that the entirety if you look at the big picture of this story

2760
02:19:22,752 --> 02:19:28,896
All it does is disprove everything Anders Breivik believed in

2761
02:19:29,152 --> 02:19:29,664
Culturalism

2762
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:31,200
The culture that believes in

2763
02:19:31,968 --> 02:19:33,248
Except

2764
02:19:34,272 --> 02:19:36,064
Is the same culture that refuses

2765
02:19:36,320 --> 02:19:37,088
Torture him in prison

2766
02:19:37,344 --> 02:19:39,904
Exactly the culture that keeps him alive and allows him

2767
02:19:40,160 --> 02:19:42,464
Play video games we won't go crazy

2768
02:19:42,720 --> 02:19:45,280
It allows him to have correspondence

2769
02:19:46,048 --> 02:19:46,816
Crazier

2770
02:19:47,072 --> 02:19:50,144
Did allows him to have correspondence with the outside world

2771
02:19:50,400 --> 02:19:51,168
Reality shows

2772
02:19:51,424 --> 02:19:52,192
Have a

2773
02:19:52,704 --> 02:19:56,288
Electronic typewriter so he can write his manifestoes

2774
02:19:56,544 --> 02:19:57,312
And things like that

2775
02:19:57,824 --> 02:19:59,360
It's A3 leaving indict

2776
02:20:01,152 --> 02:20:01,920
He believes in the facts

2777
02:20:02,176 --> 02:20:02,688
Society

2778
02:20:03,200 --> 02:20:03,712
Are able to

2779
02:20:03,968 --> 02:20:04,992
To deal with someone like you

2780
02:20:05,504 --> 02:20:06,784
And not be like

2781
02:20:07,040 --> 02:20:07,552
You know what

2782
02:20:07,808 --> 02:20:12,416
We are going to torture you ask slowly and

2783
02:20:12,928 --> 02:20:15,488
Is United States

2784
02:20:16,256 --> 02:20:20,352
What is it like what if I always I've always believed that like

2785
02:20:20,608 --> 02:20:21,888
The best reaction

2786
02:20:22,144 --> 02:20:23,168
911

2787
02:20:23,424 --> 02:20:24,192
Would have been like

2788
02:20:24,704 --> 02:20:25,728
This wasn't

2789
02:20:26,240 --> 02:20:27,008
A country

2790
02:20:27,264 --> 02:20:29,056
This wasn't a

2791
02:20:29,312 --> 02:20:30,080
Ideology

2792
02:20:30,336 --> 02:20:31,616
This was lunatic

2793
02:20:31,872 --> 02:20:34,432
Text if we condemn these f****** lunatic

2794
02:20:34,688 --> 02:20:35,712
But you know what

2795
02:20:35,968 --> 02:20:39,040
We're going to build these f****** Towers backup you have done nothing

2796
02:20:41,088 --> 02:20:42,112
You can't do it

2797
02:20:42,368 --> 02:20:46,976
That's what I've always believed

2798
02:20:47,232 --> 02:20:48,000
F****** kill him

2799
02:20:48,256 --> 02:20:53,376
Like a but what was the Iraq War other than proving that America is

2800
02:20:53,632 --> 02:20:54,144
Garbage

2801
02:20:54,400 --> 02:20:56,448
That mentality doesn't

2802
02:20:56,960 --> 02:21:03,104
Anywhere

2803
02:21:03,360 --> 02:21:09,504
Revenge digs his own grave

2804
02:21:12,832 --> 02:21:13,856
I don't know

2805
02:21:14,368 --> 02:21:20,000
Like I said

2806
02:21:20,256 --> 02:21:23,584
Commit white genocide and I've been wanting to for so long

2807
02:21:23,840 --> 02:21:24,608
Because restraint ism

2808
02:21:25,120 --> 02:21:26,656
I know you're a better person

2809
02:21:29,728 --> 02:21:35,872
What is illogical

2810
02:21:36,128 --> 02:21:38,432
Zurich

2811
02:21:42,016 --> 02:21:43,040
Nail this down

2812
02:21:43,808 --> 02:21:45,088
We're deep into the show now

2813
02:21:45,600 --> 02:21:47,648
Alex should have more information at

2814
02:21:47,904 --> 02:21:48,416
Is disposal

2815
02:21:48,672 --> 02:21:49,952
And what's see if he does

2816
02:21:50,720 --> 02:21:53,792
Norway seven dad

2817
02:21:54,048 --> 02:21:57,376
How are you

2818
02:21:57,632 --> 02:22:03,520
Rupert Grint

2819
02:22:04,032 --> 02:22:06,592
Earlier argument

2820
02:22:06,848 --> 02:22:12,736
Clearly that was staged f*** off but nothing is true

2821
02:22:12,992 --> 02:22:13,504
Globalist

2822
02:22:13,760 --> 02:22:15,552
98%

2823
02:22:18,112 --> 02:22:24,000
Whenever you can never believe it's statistically believing it is stupid hours later

2824
02:22:25,024 --> 02:22:27,072
He's being the worst journalist in the world

2825
02:22:27,328 --> 02:22:30,400
So now he talks about what the globalist

2826
02:22:36,800 --> 02:22:37,824
Call this would start

2827
02:22:38,336 --> 02:22:42,944
Al-Qaeda

2828
02:22:43,200 --> 02:22:47,808
The Roundup

2829
02:22:48,064 --> 02:22:49,600
Scenario

2830
02:22:50,112 --> 02:22:52,928
Domestic bobcat

2831
02:22:53,184 --> 02:22:56,768
Was trying to start a World War 3

2832
02:22:57,280 --> 02:22:58,560
Anders f****** brevik

2833
02:22:59,328 --> 02:23:00,096
It's clear

2834
02:23:00,352 --> 02:23:04,960
That's what he was doing he was trying parts

2835
02:23:05,216 --> 02:23:07,264
Involve these flash attack

2836
02:23:08,288 --> 02:23:09,056
He perpetrated

2837
02:23:09,568 --> 02:23:10,592
Which was in order to

2838
02:23:11,360 --> 02:23:13,408
3-stage European

2839
02:23:13,664 --> 02:23:15,200
That would lead with the repression

2840
02:23:15,456 --> 02:23:16,736
OVA

2841
02:23:16,992 --> 02:23:17,504
As a whole

2842
02:23:18,784 --> 02:23:22,112
Alex being like the globalist plan to do this

2843
02:23:22,880 --> 02:23:23,648
You're right

2844
02:23:23,904 --> 02:23:27,488
You're right in terms of vit

2845
02:23:27,744 --> 02:23:31,072
It was the idea of someone who believes the same things you do

2846
02:23:32,608 --> 02:23:33,376
Which is

2847
02:23:35,680 --> 02:23:36,960
More perfect

2848
02:23:37,984 --> 02:23:38,496
The

2849
02:23:39,008 --> 02:23:40,544
People who are

2850
02:23:40,800 --> 02:23:41,568
Most Simba

2851
02:23:42,336 --> 02:23:43,360
2 Anders Drive

2852
02:23:43,872 --> 02:23:46,176
Are the people that he ostensibly is

2853
02:23:47,456 --> 02:23:48,736
Like that idea of

2854
02:23:48,992 --> 02:23:51,296
Muslim extremist

2855
02:23:51,808 --> 02:23:53,600
Like that whole concept of like

2856
02:23:53,856 --> 02:23:56,160
Trying to start the end time

2857
02:23:56,416 --> 02:24:00,256
The only people who could possibly understand them

2858
02:24:00,512 --> 02:24:02,048
Are not human beings but

2859
02:24:02,304 --> 02:24:03,328
Christian extremist

2860
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:05,376
The only people who can

2861
02:24:05,632 --> 02:24:06,400
Really get

2862
02:24:06,656 --> 02:24:12,800
Exactly why and what are the people who are trying to do it right

2863
02:24:13,056 --> 02:24:16,128
You're the same you are the

2864
02:24:16,384 --> 02:24:16,896
Sing

2865
02:24:17,152 --> 02:24:18,432
This is where it's at

2866
02:24:18,688 --> 02:24:19,200
Probably

2867
02:24:19,456 --> 02:24:22,016
Most fitting that I bring up another Passage

2868
02:24:22,528 --> 02:24:23,040
From his

2869
02:24:23,296 --> 02:24:29,440
Anders Breivik

2870
02:24:33,024 --> 02:24:34,560
Full hog on this record

2871
02:24:34,816 --> 02:24:36,352
Behind the game

2872
02:24:36,608 --> 02:24:40,960
I don't think so he's only have till bugs

2873
02:24:43,008 --> 02:24:47,104
Like Logistics portion of his Manifesto

2874
02:24:47,360 --> 02:24:49,664
Haters brother talks about the idea of

2875
02:24:49,920 --> 02:24:51,968
Like hooking up with Al-Qaeda

2876
02:24:52,224 --> 02:24:56,832
Because I could buy weapons from them

2877
02:24:57,088 --> 02:24:59,392
Getting involved with terrorist groups

2878
02:24:59,648 --> 02:25:01,184
Terrorist

2879
02:25:01,440 --> 02:25:02,464
But at the same time

2880
02:25:02,720 --> 02:25:03,744
If you read all of this passage

2881
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:04,768
Did you talk about how like

2882
02:25:05,280 --> 02:25:06,304
This could work

2883
02:25:06,816 --> 02:25:09,888
He probably wouldn't it's not a Wise Road to go down

2884
02:25:10,400 --> 02:25:15,264
It seems they're in his Manifesto as a possible way to get like a wmd

2885
02:25:16,288 --> 02:25:17,824
He's like yeah we probably shouldn't

2886
02:25:18,080 --> 02:25:20,640
Do this

2887
02:25:20,896 --> 02:25:22,176
Right but it's in there

2888
02:25:22,432 --> 02:25:22,944
It in there

2889
02:25:23,200 --> 02:25:24,736
Possibility

2890
02:25:25,504 --> 02:25:28,064
The only people that can understand me are the p

2891
02:25:28,320 --> 02:25:29,088
People who I am us

2892
02:25:29,344 --> 02:25:29,856
Ostensibly fighting

2893
02:25:30,112 --> 02:25:31,136
Exactly

2894
02:25:31,392 --> 02:25:32,416
Create my own app

2895
02:25:33,184 --> 02:25:33,696
The Summit

2896
02:25:33,952 --> 02:25:34,464
Yep

2897
02:25:34,720 --> 02:25:35,232
Picking up

2898
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:40,096
God dammit

2899
02:25:40,608 --> 02:25:42,144
This next clip is so f****** horrifying

2900
02:25:43,168 --> 02:25:48,032
Muslim

2901
02:25:52,640 --> 02:25:55,200
Please God let me know

2902
02:25:55,712 --> 02:25:57,504
Unicorn hair

2903
02:25:57,760 --> 02:25:58,272
Fake

2904
02:26:00,064 --> 02:26:02,368
I don't know why you'd be praying it was Muslim

2905
02:26:02,880 --> 02:26:06,464
Unless your modus operandi in your whole rhizzone d'etre

2906
02:26:06,720 --> 02:26:08,256
Is 2

2907
02:26:08,512 --> 02:26:09,024
Demonized

2908
02:26:10,304 --> 02:26:12,096
That that's what he's like

2909
02:26:12,352 --> 02:26:13,120
Please God let it be

2910
02:26:13,376 --> 02:26:13,888
We Muslims

2911
02:26:14,656 --> 02:26:15,936
I hear something like that.

2912
02:26:16,448 --> 02:26:17,984
F***

2913
02:26:18,240 --> 02:26:19,008
Dark that is

2914
02:26:19,264 --> 02:26:19,776
Is dark

2915
02:26:20,288 --> 02:26:20,800
Because it's

2916
02:26:21,056 --> 02:26:22,336
It comes from a place of flipping

2917
02:26:22,848 --> 02:26:25,152
Like he's not used talking extemporaneously

2918
02:26:25,408 --> 02:26:26,944
Here's kind of ripping around

2919
02:26:27,200 --> 02:26:27,712
And that's

2920
02:26:27,968 --> 02:26:28,992
Where his brain is stuck

2921
02:26:29,248 --> 02:26:30,528
I wish this was

2922
02:26:31,296 --> 02:26:32,064
I wish

2923
02:26:32,320 --> 02:26:32,832
Because

2924
02:26:33,344 --> 02:26:35,136
He is saying it is Muslims

2925
02:26:35,904 --> 02:26:37,440
But he believed that the Muslims are working

2926
02:26:37,696 --> 02:26:38,208
For the globalist

2927
02:26:40,256 --> 02:26:40,768
He's wrong

2928
02:26:41,280 --> 02:26:41,792
Unlike 3lau

2929
02:26:47,168 --> 02:26:47,680
Jordans

2930
02:26:49,472 --> 02:26:50,240
I remember

2931
02:26:51,776 --> 02:26:52,288
Set

2932
02:26:53,568 --> 02:26:55,360
Restart the show do you like

2933
02:26:55,872 --> 02:26:56,640
This is going to be fun

2934
02:27:00,992 --> 02:27:06,112
The great idea even crazy read we're going to laugh at it

2935
02:27:06,368 --> 02:27:06,880
Craziness

2936
02:27:07,136 --> 02:27:08,416
Yeah it's cruel but most

2937
02:27:09,440 --> 02:27:09,952
Crazy

2938
02:27:11,232 --> 02:27:14,048
You got to go where the information leads you man

2939
02:27:15,840 --> 02:27:16,864
I was a radical left

2940
02:27:18,144 --> 02:27:19,424
Music

2941
02:27:19,680 --> 02:27:20,448
2 years ago

2942
02:27:23,008 --> 02:27:24,544
Does dad know

2943
02:27:24,800 --> 02:27:29,664
Another step forward your cultural marxists

2944
02:27:30,944 --> 02:27:32,480
Globalist cultural marks

2945
02:27:34,016 --> 02:27:34,784
Dad

2946
02:27:35,296 --> 02:27:36,576
But I don't like

2947
02:27:37,344 --> 02:27:38,368
I don't think

2948
02:27:38,880 --> 02:27:40,672
So we look at Astor radicalized Rapala

2949
02:27:41,184 --> 02:27:41,696
It just has to

2950
02:27:42,208 --> 02:27:44,000
Inform what you know about

2951
02:27:46,048 --> 02:27:48,864
Which is that if anybody that you know is

2952
02:27:49,632 --> 02:27:50,400
Right wing

2953
02:27:51,168 --> 02:27:51,936
It is not

2954
02:27:52,448 --> 02:27:53,728
Sara Lee that they

2955
02:27:53,984 --> 02:27:54,752
Believe all of the

2956
02:27:55,776 --> 02:27:57,824
Sometimes it is not necessarily that

2957
02:27:58,080 --> 02:28:01,152
They are

2958
02:28:01,408 --> 02:28:01,920
Camp

2959
02:28:02,176 --> 02:28:02,944
Possibly Concha

2960
02:28:03,200 --> 02:28:03,712
Justly believe

2961
02:28:04,224 --> 02:28:05,248
Most of them because

2962
02:28:05,760 --> 02:28:08,576
At the end it's like they believe that they're good people

2963
02:28:08,832 --> 02:28:10,624
Like so many people so many

2964
02:28:10,880 --> 02:28:11,648
People on the right wing

2965
02:28:11,904 --> 02:28:14,976
Would see somebody who is Muslim who is

2966
02:28:15,232 --> 02:28:18,816
I saw them at a little bile

2967
02:28:19,072 --> 02:28:23,168
For a little while and then maybe we went out at maybe we were in the same program

2968
02:28:23,424 --> 02:28:25,216
Alcoholics Anonymous

2969
02:28:25,472 --> 02:28:28,288
For anybody and we got together we became friends

2970
02:28:28,544 --> 02:28:30,336
And yet somehow I wouldn't

2971
02:28:30,592 --> 02:28:31,872
Vitamin to my home

2972
02:28:32,128 --> 02:28:33,664
Still support

2973
02:28:33,920 --> 02:28:36,992
F****** pile of goddamn garbage that wants

2974
02:28:37,248 --> 02:28:40,064
Immigrants separated from their f****** families

2975
02:28:40,320 --> 02:28:41,600
Like

2976
02:28:41,856 --> 02:28:44,672
Who don't even understand that the underpinnings

2977
02:28:44,928 --> 02:28:46,208
Of all of their beliefs

2978
02:28:46,464 --> 02:28:49,280
Read the f****** corn

2979
02:28:51,584 --> 02:28:54,400
He's a f****** white nationalist

2980
02:28:54,656 --> 02:28:55,168
Terrorist

2981
02:28:55,424 --> 02:28:56,192
They don't get that

2982
02:28:56,448 --> 02:28:58,240
40% of America

2983
02:28:58,496 --> 02:29:00,544
They probably don't recognize

2984
02:29:02,848 --> 02:29:03,872
What motivated

2985
02:29:04,128 --> 02:29:04,640
This man

2986
02:29:05,152 --> 02:29:06,176
To do what he did

2987
02:29:07,200 --> 02:29:08,224
Is the same

2988
02:29:08,736 --> 02:29:09,248
Rhetoric

2989
02:29:09,760 --> 02:29:10,784
That informed

2990
02:29:11,552 --> 02:29:12,320
Maps of trump

2991
02:29:12,576 --> 02:29:13,088
Support

2992
02:29:13,344 --> 02:29:14,880
Most of the Maga base

2993
02:29:17,184 --> 02:29:21,024
I don't I don't like brushing with a broad brush with a broad brush

2994
02:29:22,560 --> 02:29:24,352
Not everyone

2995
02:29:24,608 --> 02:29:25,632
To all the same propaganda

2996
02:29:25,888 --> 02:29:27,680
But the people who put out

2997
02:29:28,192 --> 02:29:28,704
Most of the

2998
02:29:28,960 --> 02:29:30,240
Influential

2999
02:29:30,752 --> 02:29:31,264
Media

3000
02:29:32,032 --> 02:29:34,080
Are exactly in line with

3001
02:29:34,336 --> 02:29:35,616
Everything that's in this

3002
02:29:35,872 --> 02:29:36,640
Manifest

3003
02:29:36,896 --> 02:29:37,664
It's ludicrous

3004
02:29:37,920 --> 02:29:38,944
To think that like

3005
02:29:40,480 --> 02:29:41,248
Anytime

3006
02:29:42,528 --> 02:29:43,040
Like

3007
02:29:43,296 --> 02:29:49,440
I know that the right likes to talk about Bill Ayers and

3008
02:29:49,696 --> 02:29:50,208
Read there

3009
02:29:50,976 --> 02:29:51,744
Document

3010
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:52,768
You were like

3011
02:29:53,024 --> 02:29:53,536
Oh

3012
02:29:53,792 --> 02:29:56,864
Oh s*** the in the same way

3013
02:29:57,376 --> 02:29:58,400
I would probably have to

3014
02:29:58,656 --> 02:29:59,680
Take a moment of pause

3015
02:30:00,704 --> 02:30:04,032
But they're documentary-like Destroyer

3016
02:30:05,056 --> 02:30:05,824
Not

3017
02:30:08,896 --> 02:30:14,016
That's not the point

3018
02:30:14,272 --> 02:30:19,136
Field argument

3019
02:30:20,416 --> 02:30:20,928
At this point

3020
02:30:21,184 --> 02:30:21,952
Alex is kind of

3021
02:30:22,208 --> 02:30:27,328
Floundering a little bit as being like

3022
02:30:27,840 --> 02:30:28,352
Sprint

3023
02:30:28,608 --> 02:30:30,656
Call to Lake Sardis synthesized like

3024
02:30:31,168 --> 02:30:31,680
Smarter

3025
02:30:33,984 --> 02:30:35,008
Smarter than Alex

3026
02:30:35,264 --> 02:30:41,408
And so Paul comes in with it

3027
02:30:41,920 --> 02:30:42,688
He gives

3028
02:30:48,832 --> 02:30:54,976
In line for a slap on the wrist

3029
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:57,280
Bill

3030
02:31:11,616 --> 02:31:17,760
Palestinian

3031
02:31:32,096 --> 02:31:33,376
All he's done

3032
02:31:33,632 --> 02:31:34,400
He's laid out

3033
02:31:35,680 --> 02:31:36,192
Ideas

3034
02:31:37,472 --> 02:31:38,240
Is laid out Quinn

3035
02:31:38,752 --> 02:31:39,776
None of that

3036
02:31:40,288 --> 02:31:40,800
Implies any sort

3037
02:31:41,056 --> 02:31:41,568
Causation

3038
02:31:42,336 --> 02:31:43,104
Amanda

3039
02:31:43,360 --> 02:31:43,872
Not really

3040
02:31:44,128 --> 02:31:45,664
Representative

3041
02:31:46,432 --> 02:31:47,456
You know what it is

3042
02:31:47,712 --> 02:31:48,736
Childish cause and effect

3043
02:31:54,112 --> 02:31:54,624
Infowars

3044
02:31:54,880 --> 02:31:55,392
Rhetoric

3045
02:31:55,648 --> 02:31:56,416
Skip that idea of like

3046
02:31:56,928 --> 02:31:59,744
Mysterious cause-and-effect that we are presenting a

3047
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:01,536
Has real

3048
02:32:01,792 --> 02:32:03,840
Pictures when it better than Alex

3049
02:32:04,096 --> 02:32:07,168
What's up

3050
02:32:07,424 --> 02:32:09,728
That's a throwback.

3051
02:32:11,520 --> 02:32:13,312
Evolutionary survival

3052
02:32:13,568 --> 02:32:14,336
Active

3053
02:32:15,616 --> 02:32:19,712
Create cause and effect even if there isn't because he will print

3054
02:32:21,248 --> 02:32:24,320
Always lay on the look at me

3055
02:32:24,832 --> 02:32:25,600
The Moose are out today

3056
02:32:26,112 --> 02:32:31,232
Creative

3057
02:32:31,744 --> 02:32:33,280
Basic like

3058
02:32:34,048 --> 02:32:37,120
2.5 million years ago brain stem

3059
02:32:37,376 --> 02:32:41,472
Creating those things we wouldn't have baby higher functions now

3060
02:32:41,728 --> 02:32:44,544
But if they're the remnant of it it still

3061
02:32:44,800 --> 02:32:45,312
Killings

3062
02:32:45,568 --> 02:32:46,336
Yeah

3063
02:32:49,152 --> 02:32:49,664
We try

3064
02:32:52,736 --> 02:32:53,760
Irresistible

3065
02:32:54,016 --> 02:32:54,528
Google Drive

3066
02:32:55,808 --> 02:32:56,320
Connections

3067
02:32:58,112 --> 02:32:59,136
Anyways

3068
02:32:59,392 --> 02:33:02,720
It's a full moon tonight Dan so don't be surprised if people start acting

3069
02:33:02,976 --> 02:33:03,488
Been crazy

3070
02:33:09,632 --> 02:33:10,656
We've come to the point of

3071
02:33:10,912 --> 02:33:11,424
The show

3072
02:33:11,680 --> 02:33:12,960
Where the news reports are

3073
02:33:13,216 --> 02:33:13,984
You're clearly saying

3074
02:33:14,496 --> 02:33:15,264
This was a white guy

3075
02:33:15,776 --> 02:33:16,544
Blond guy

3076
02:33:17,568 --> 02:33:18,080
Who carried out the

3077
02:33:19,104 --> 02:33:22,432
And may have had right

3078
02:33:23,456 --> 02:33:24,736
And so Alex now has to

3079
02:33:24,992 --> 02:33:26,272
The process that information

3080
02:33:27,040 --> 02:33:28,576
And I would say he doesn't in maybe

3081
02:33:29,088 --> 02:33:29,600
Worst way possible

3082
02:33:48,544 --> 02:33:51,360
Absolutely

3083
02:33:54,944 --> 02:34:01,088
Ladies and gentlemen right-wingers in Europe

3084
02:34:12,864 --> 02:34:18,240
Okay

3085
02:34:18,752 --> 02:34:24,896
Hey Alex know people that you align with in Europe

3086
02:34:25,664 --> 02:34:26,688
Hate Muslims

3087
02:34:28,224 --> 02:34:29,760
Not that they have a good point

3088
02:34:30,272 --> 02:34:32,576
Not that there was spawned into anything real

3089
02:34:33,088 --> 02:34:34,624
Right-wingers in Europe

3090
02:34:34,880 --> 02:34:35,392
Hate

3091
02:34:35,648 --> 02:34:41,792
Muslim government chooses to demonized

3092
02:34:42,048 --> 02:34:48,192
Actually that's why they choose them to commit their false flag attack

3093
02:34:48,448 --> 02:34:53,056
Text because then you would believe that all right Wingers believe that

3094
02:34:53,312 --> 02:34:56,896
Because Waylon

3095
02:35:02,528 --> 02:35:03,552
Who believed that

3096
02:35:03,808 --> 02:35:09,952
False flag right-wingers believe that putting a hat on a hat

3097
02:35:10,208 --> 02:35:13,280
Joking a joke

3098
02:35:18,144 --> 02:35:19,936
What is the set-up is bazetta

3099
02:35:20,960 --> 02:35:21,984
And that's a joke

3100
02:35:22,496 --> 02:35:25,568
Look at the ring is describing like

3101
02:35:25,824 --> 02:35:27,872
Ecosystem where

3102
02:35:28,384 --> 02:35:30,688
Right-wingers hate Muslims they would

3103
02:35:30,944 --> 02:35:34,016
Germans love David Hasselhoff

3104
02:35:36,064 --> 02:35:37,344
It's just ludicrous like

3105
02:35:37,600 --> 02:35:39,136
He would never say that now

3106
02:35:39,392 --> 02:35:40,672
He's saying that it's some sort of

3107
02:35:40,928 --> 02:35:43,744
Defense against the idea that this was

3108
02:35:44,256 --> 02:35:44,768
What

3109
02:35:45,024 --> 02:35:47,072
A hundred percent

3110
02:35:47,584 --> 02:35:48,096
Absolutely

3111
02:35:50,400 --> 02:35:50,912
But

3112
02:35:51,424 --> 02:35:53,216
I would argue based on the hundred

3113
02:35:53,472 --> 02:35:54,240
The pages that I've read

3114
02:35:55,008 --> 02:35:56,032
He straight up 8

3115
02:35:57,824 --> 02:36:00,128
He's more primarily motivated

3116
02:36:02,944 --> 02:36:09,088
Twitter your fit for a Muslim

3117
02:36:09,344 --> 02:36:12,160
The world

3118
02:36:12,416 --> 02:36:14,208
The thing that I think he hates

3119
02:36:14,464 --> 02:36:17,024
More is the multiculturalism

3120
02:36:19,072 --> 02:36:19,840
Cultural Marx

3121
02:36:20,096 --> 02:36:20,608
Which is

3122
02:36:20,864 --> 02:36:21,888
Code for globalist

3123
02:36:22,144 --> 02:36:22,912
Which is code for

3124
02:36:23,424 --> 02:36:26,496
Alex's worlds

3125
02:36:26,752 --> 02:36:28,800
Was primarily motivated by

3126
02:36:29,056 --> 02:36:30,336
But the primary motivation

3127
02:36:30,592 --> 02:36:31,616
He's also washed up

3128
02:36:32,128 --> 02:36:32,640
Do that

3129
02:36:32,896 --> 02:36:33,664
That worlds

3130
02:36:34,432 --> 02:36:35,456
You could easily ascribe to

3131
02:36:36,736 --> 02:36:37,248
He's afraid of

3132
02:36:37,504 --> 02:36:39,552
The globalist allowing Muslims in

3133
02:36:39,808 --> 02:36:41,088
Yeah it's the same thing

3134
02:36:42,880 --> 02:36:45,184
I know I'm making a really fine line

3135
02:36:45,696 --> 02:36:49,024
But it's a Nazi but

3136
02:36:49,792 --> 02:36:50,304
Anti

3137
02:36:50,560 --> 02:36:51,328
Nazi and Hitler

3138
02:36:52,096 --> 02:36:54,400
So it becomes more complicated you want to save it

3139
02:36:54,656 --> 02:36:55,680
He just hates most

3140
02:36:56,960 --> 02:37:01,568
Hate Muslims but there's another layer to it more

3141
02:37:01,824 --> 02:37:02,848
The traitorous

3142
02:37:03,104 --> 02:37:03,616
Government

3143
02:37:03,872 --> 02:37:05,664
People who are allowing the Muslims

3144
02:37:06,176 --> 02:37:06,944
And the only reason

3145
02:37:07,200 --> 02:37:07,712
I feel the need

3146
02:37:07,968 --> 02:37:08,480
To make that fine

3147
02:37:08,736 --> 02:37:09,504
Point is because

3148
02:37:10,272 --> 02:37:11,040
It is

3149
02:37:11,552 --> 02:37:12,832
Accurately reporting

3150
02:37:13,344 --> 02:37:14,112
And it makes it

3151
02:37:14,368 --> 02:37:16,416
More smart alec

3152
02:37:16,672 --> 02:37:17,184
But that

3153
02:37:18,464 --> 02:37:20,000
That's the essential underpinning

3154
02:37:20,256 --> 02:37:23,584
Into so many of those like

3155
02:37:23,840 --> 02:37:24,608
Justifications is

3156
02:37:24,864 --> 02:37:31,008
On the macro put on the micro it's fine like a good Muslim

3157
02:37:32,800 --> 02:37:38,176
Exactly

3158
02:37:38,432 --> 02:37:42,272
All of them in the large majority

3159
02:37:42,528 --> 02:37:43,552
The good ones

3160
02:37:43,808 --> 02:37:44,320
Like

3161
02:37:44,576 --> 02:37:50,720
F****** Dave Attell

3162
02:37:50,976 --> 02:37:56,608
How many f****** stories do you read

3163
02:37:56,864 --> 02:37:58,400
A small town is like

3164
02:37:58,656 --> 02:38:04,800
99% for Trump and then they find out that their buddy was an illegal immigrant there like

3165
02:38:05,056 --> 02:38:11,200
No you're not supposed to take him you're not supposed to take him he's cool

3166
02:38:11,456 --> 02:38:17,344
Check the magazine believe that most immigrants

3167
02:38:17,600 --> 02:38:19,648
They're cool because we're told that they're not right

3168
02:38:20,672 --> 02:38:22,464
I know it's a

3169
02:38:23,488 --> 02:38:25,792
We were experiencing the world largely

3170
02:38:27,072 --> 02:38:27,584
Coming to

3171
02:38:27,840 --> 02:38:28,608
Do propaganda

3172
02:38:28,864 --> 02:38:30,144
Over their own

3173
02:38:30,400 --> 02:38:32,448
Experience in that event

3174
02:38:32,704 --> 02:38:36,032
Great way of putting it really sad

3175
02:38:36,288 --> 02:38:36,800
Affairs

3176
02:38:37,056 --> 02:38:37,824
But I also think

3177
02:38:39,104 --> 02:38:40,384
For like

3178
02:38:40,896 --> 02:38:41,408
Conversation about

3179
02:38:41,664 --> 02:38:43,200
This recently about the idea

3180
02:38:44,480 --> 02:38:45,760
You know with diminishing in

3181
02:38:46,784 --> 02:38:47,296
Charter.

3182
02:38:47,552 --> 02:38:48,832
Travel

3183
02:38:49,088 --> 02:38:49,600
The world

3184
02:38:49,856 --> 02:38:50,624
Harder to get outside

3185
02:38:50,880 --> 02:38:51,392
Have your bubble

3186
02:38:51,648 --> 02:38:53,184
But at the same time the internet

3187
02:38:55,744 --> 02:38:57,280
Experience so much of the world

3188
02:38:57,536 --> 02:38:58,048
Leaving your desk

3189
02:38:58,304 --> 02:38:59,072
Right

3190
02:38:59,584 --> 02:39:02,656
There is a bear is a possibility for experiencing

3191
02:39:02,912 --> 02:39:05,472
Things so much more than you ever were able to

3192
02:39:05,984 --> 02:39:07,008
I without leaving

3193
02:39:08,544 --> 02:39:09,056
Whatever

3194
02:39:09,312 --> 02:39:09,824
Gets funneled

3195
02:39:10,336 --> 02:39:11,104
The wrong places

3196
02:39:12,128 --> 02:39:14,432
What ends up happening

3197
02:39:14,688 --> 02:39:15,200
Is like

3198
02:39:15,456 --> 02:39:15,968
Like you have

3199
02:39:16,992 --> 02:39:17,760
You said Dave

3200
02:39:18,272 --> 02:39:19,808
Let's use that

3201
02:39:20,064 --> 02:39:21,856
You have this person that you know who is

3202
02:39:22,112 --> 02:39:23,136
Very awesome

3203
02:39:24,160 --> 02:39:24,928
Who is

3204
02:39:26,208 --> 02:39:26,976
I meant you have

3205
02:39:27,232 --> 02:39:28,512
Your view of the world

3206
02:39:29,024 --> 02:39:29,792
Possibly a lot of it

3207
02:39:30,048 --> 02:39:31,072
What time is this negative

3208
02:39:31,584 --> 02:39:32,864
The world

3209
02:39:33,120 --> 02:39:34,656
No don't believe it don't believe it

3210
02:39:34,912 --> 02:39:37,216
But he's fine but there's all these others were

3211
02:39:37,472 --> 02:39:38,496
Like they want to kill you

3212
02:39:38,752 --> 02:39:40,288
Yeah

3213
02:39:41,568 --> 02:39:42,848
I don't know what the

3214
02:39:43,104 --> 02:39:43,872
Forward looks like

3215
02:39:47,456 --> 02:39:48,736
If your experiences

3216
02:39:48,992 --> 02:39:50,784
The world like legitimately is

3217
02:39:51,040 --> 02:39:51,808
Trumped by

3218
02:39:52,064 --> 02:39:54,112
By Propaganda

3219
02:39:54,624 --> 02:39:58,208
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

3220
02:39:58,976 --> 02:40:01,024
What you need to know about his Cultural Arts.

3221
02:40:01,536 --> 02:40:03,072
Right

3222
02:40:03,328 --> 02:40:04,352
To want to flood our country

3223
02:40:04,608 --> 02:40:10,752
Right

3224
02:40:12,032 --> 02:40:13,056
Addendum

3225
02:40:15,104 --> 02:40:18,176
Want more days

3226
02:40:19,200 --> 02:40:25,344
They'll all vote for Multicultural

3227
02:40:25,600 --> 02:40:28,928
Exactly

3228
02:40:30,208 --> 02:40:36,352
Which is a generalization that I was like

3229
02:40:41,984 --> 02:40:45,568
Metaphorically

3230
02:40:48,128 --> 02:40:48,640
I think that it's

3231
02:40:49,408 --> 02:40:49,920
It's very

3232
02:40:50,688 --> 02:40:52,480
A lot of people

3233
02:40:52,992 --> 02:40:53,760
Still having

3234
02:40:54,016 --> 02:40:54,528
Immersive

3235
02:40:55,552 --> 02:40:56,064
Still understand

3236
02:40:57,088 --> 02:40:58,112
People from all walks of

3237
02:40:59,136 --> 02:40:59,904
And Coolidge

3238
02:41:00,160 --> 02:41:01,440
You know

3239
02:41:02,208 --> 02:41:02,720
That no one

3240
02:41:03,488 --> 02:41:04,256
Without

3241
02:41:08,096 --> 02:41:08,864
Drug abuse

3242
02:41:10,400 --> 02:41:12,960
Terrible circumstances in life

3243
02:41:13,216 --> 02:41:13,728
Orestes

3244
02:41:13,984 --> 02:41:15,776
Demonstrable

3245
02:41:16,032 --> 02:41:16,544
Crazy

3246
02:41:16,800 --> 02:41:18,336
Circumstance

3247
02:41:18,848 --> 02:41:19,360
Wants to hurt

3248
02:41:20,128 --> 02:41:20,640
Yeah like

3249
02:41:21,152 --> 02:41:24,224
Most people understand everyone from Every Walk of Life

3250
02:41:24,736 --> 02:41:26,784
Loves their family everybody wants

3251
02:41:27,296 --> 02:41:29,088
Have a real f****** good time hanging out with

3252
02:41:29,344 --> 02:41:30,368
Each other

3253
02:41:31,648 --> 02:41:32,416
You don't believe that

3254
02:41:32,672 --> 02:41:33,440
Then that's on you

3255
02:41:33,952 --> 02:41:34,464
I think I see

3256
02:41:34,720 --> 02:41:35,232
Most people

3257
02:41:37,024 --> 02:41:38,048
Like we talked about

3258
02:41:38,304 --> 02:41:38,816
There's that for

3259
02:41:39,328 --> 02:41:40,864
Thursday

3260
02:41:41,376 --> 02:41:44,192
I think better with those people

3261
02:41:44,704 --> 02:41:46,240
98%

3262
02:41:47,008 --> 02:41:48,288
Barr Lake

3263
02:41:49,056 --> 02:41:51,872
No matter who is affected by the propaganda

3264
02:41:52,384 --> 02:41:55,200
90% of people in their own lives

3265
02:41:55,456 --> 02:41:56,736
In their own small place

3266
02:41:57,504 --> 02:41:58,784
Just want to be

3267
02:41:59,552 --> 02:42:02,880
We are we're trying to be

3268
02:42:03,136 --> 02:42:04,160
Kind in a way

3269
02:42:04,672 --> 02:42:10,304
And unfortunately percent is somehow capable

3270
02:42:10,560 --> 02:42:11,840
Are somehow capable of

3271
02:42:12,096 --> 02:42:14,656
Creating this propaganda that can convince people

3272
02:42:14,912 --> 02:42:15,680
Otherwise

3273
02:42:15,936 --> 02:42:18,496
Wouldn't want to harm someone

3274
02:42:18,752 --> 02:42:24,128
The reason that there's a reason that there isn't that 40% of the country doesn't

3275
02:42:24,384 --> 02:42:25,152
Murder people

3276
02:42:25,408 --> 02:42:26,944
You get on exactly what I say

3277
02:42:27,200 --> 02:42:28,224
I think it's sort of like

3278
02:42:30,016 --> 02:42:30,528
Is 5 point

3279
02:42:30,784 --> 02:42:31,296
Perfect

3280
02:42:31,552 --> 02:42:34,368
Ideal version of society

3281
02:42:34,624 --> 02:42:35,136
The version of that

3282
02:42:35,392 --> 02:42:35,904
Myself

3283
02:42:36,416 --> 02:42:36,928
And one

3284
02:42:37,184 --> 02:42:37,696
The Miz

3285
02:42:37,952 --> 02:42:38,464
Like

3286
02:42:38,720 --> 02:42:39,744
Get rid of the Welsh

3287
02:42:40,512 --> 02:42:41,024
Number one

3288
02:42:41,280 --> 02:42:46,912
Number two

3289
02:42:47,168 --> 02:42:48,704
More importantly

3290
02:42:49,216 --> 02:42:51,008
Like we need to grow up

3291
02:42:51,264 --> 02:42:51,776
To a certainty

3292
02:42:52,544 --> 02:42:53,568
And recognized

3293
02:42:53,824 --> 02:42:54,848
You say 2%

3294
02:42:55,104 --> 02:42:56,128
In terms of like Monsters

3295
02:42:57,152 --> 02:42:59,968
We have to grow up to the point where we realize that like

3296
02:43:00,736 --> 02:43:03,296
There are just anomalies in society

3297
02:43:03,552 --> 02:43:04,576
Based on Howard Hughes

3298
02:43:04,832 --> 02:43:05,344
Bring

3299
02:43:06,880 --> 02:43:07,392
That we

3300
02:43:08,672 --> 02:43:09,440
Just absorbed

3301
02:43:10,208 --> 02:43:11,232
Yeah it sucks

3302
02:43:11,744 --> 02:43:12,768
It's doctors things

3303
02:43:13,024 --> 02:43:14,816
We can do to mitigate the damage of that

3304
02:43:15,072 --> 02:43:15,584
Which is

3305
02:43:15,840 --> 02:43:16,352
Number one

3306
02:43:17,120 --> 02:43:17,888
Stockton gun control

3307
02:43:18,144 --> 02:43:21,728
Do that if you do real hard

3308
02:43:21,984 --> 02:43:23,776
Buddy Guy

3309
02:43:24,032 --> 02:43:27,104
Get money out of politics so there's a lot of political things that we need

3310
02:43:27,360 --> 02:43:28,640
In order to achieve this

3311
02:43:30,432 --> 02:43:32,736
We realize that like

3312
02:43:33,760 --> 02:43:34,272
Yeah man

3313
02:43:34,528 --> 02:43:35,296
It sucks

3314
02:43:35,552 --> 02:43:37,856
Living in a society does involve a certain

3315
02:43:38,880 --> 02:43:40,416
Yeah because everyone around you

3316
02:43:40,928 --> 02:43:42,464
I want someone my

3317
02:43:44,256 --> 02:43:45,024
And it sucks

3318
02:43:45,280 --> 02:43:45,792
It does happen

3319
02:43:46,048 --> 02:43:47,328
We need to not

3320
02:43:47,840 --> 02:43:48,352
That is

3321
02:43:49,120 --> 02:43:49,632
Of

3322
02:43:49,888 --> 02:43:51,680
XYZ generalization

3323
02:43:51,936 --> 02:43:52,448
That leaves

3324
02:43:55,008 --> 02:43:59,872
But you need to say

3325
02:44:00,128 --> 02:44:01,152
Those 2%

3326
02:44:02,176 --> 02:44:02,944
Two paths are

3327
02:44:03,200 --> 02:44:03,968
Far more

3328
02:44:04,224 --> 02:44:05,760
Capable of manipulating

3329
02:44:06,016 --> 02:44:06,528
The system

3330
02:44:06,784 --> 02:44:08,320
To destroy the rest of

3331
02:44:09,088 --> 02:44:13,696
Look at anybody who's a billionaire

3332
02:44:14,720 --> 02:44:15,744
You're like well

3333
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:18,304
98% of humanity is cool

3334
02:44:18,560 --> 02:44:19,584
But those 2%

3335
02:44:20,096 --> 02:44:22,400
98%

3336
02:44:22,912 --> 02:44:24,704
Right you don't like that kind of thing

3337
02:44:25,728 --> 02:44:28,800
It's because I'm not saying that their Perfect Analogy by any

3338
02:44:29,056 --> 02:44:31,360
About anyway

3339
02:44:31,872 --> 02:44:32,384
I'm not scared of

3340
02:44:32,640 --> 02:44:34,176
Because here's the God's honest

3341
02:44:34,432 --> 02:44:34,944
Is truth

3342
02:44:35,968 --> 02:44:36,480
Lake

3343
02:44:36,736 --> 02:44:38,272
People who are propaganda

3344
02:44:39,040 --> 02:44:39,808
Use these tricks

3345
02:44:40,576 --> 02:44:42,880
There are only so many tricks they can use

3346
02:44:44,928 --> 02:44:45,952
In the same way that if

3347
02:44:46,208 --> 02:44:46,976
You study logic

3348
02:44:47,744 --> 02:44:48,768
You understand logical

3349
02:44:49,024 --> 02:44:49,536
Fallacies

3350
02:44:50,048 --> 02:44:51,072
And so you're able to

3351
02:44:51,584 --> 02:44:53,632
Look at an argument be like oh no that's

3352
02:44:53,888 --> 02:44:54,400
Question

3353
02:44:55,168 --> 02:44:55,680
You know what you're doing there

3354
02:44:55,936 --> 02:44:58,240
Affirming the

3355
02:44:59,520 --> 02:45:01,568
What you've done there is not a that's against

3356
02:45:02,848 --> 02:45:04,896
Yeah they're only a certain amount of logic

3357
02:45:05,920 --> 02:45:06,432
Is that exist

3358
02:45:06,688 --> 02:45:07,456
Because of how distraught

3359
02:45:07,712 --> 02:45:08,224
Picture of argument

3360
02:45:08,480 --> 02:45:08,992
Yet

3361
02:45:09,504 --> 02:45:10,784
In terms of thin in the same

3362
02:45:12,064 --> 02:45:13,600
Propaganda only works

3363
02:45:15,136 --> 02:45:15,648
15.

3364
02:45:16,928 --> 02:45:18,208
Like there aren't a lot of ways.

3365
02:45:18,720 --> 02:45:20,000
Compelling to make an ARG

3366
02:45:20,768 --> 02:45:22,304
That are emotionally

3367
02:45:22,816 --> 02:45:25,888
There is a finite number of ways that people can

3368
02:45:26,144 --> 02:45:26,656
Rikyu

3369
02:45:26,912 --> 02:45:27,936
Into

3370
02:45:28,704 --> 02:45:31,008
Forgetting your higher brain and going with emotion

3371
02:45:34,080 --> 02:45:34,592
And the reason

3372
02:45:36,640 --> 02:45:37,920
Is that I hope

3373
02:45:38,688 --> 02:45:39,968
And how Society

3374
02:45:41,760 --> 02:45:42,272
We go along

3375
02:45:44,832 --> 02:45:45,600
Do-si-dos

3376
02:45:46,624 --> 02:45:47,136
I'm idealist

3377
02:45:49,440 --> 02:45:49,952
Well

3378
02:45:50,208 --> 02:45:51,232
Climate

3379
02:45:51,744 --> 02:45:52,768
But those sorts of

3380
02:45:56,096 --> 02:45:56,864
Fuel to

3381
02:45:57,888 --> 02:45:58,400
Demography

3382
02:45:58,912 --> 02:45:59,424
Appeals to

3383
02:46:00,448 --> 02:46:01,472
Unproven

3384
02:46:03,519 --> 02:46:04,287
The appeals to

3385
02:46:06,079 --> 02:46:06,591
Asperger

3386
02:46:09,919 --> 02:46:11,199
Is everyone just

3387
02:46:11,967 --> 02:46:13,759
Understand oh this is how propaganda

3388
02:46:14,015 --> 02:46:14,527
Manipulate

3389
02:46:14,783 --> 02:46:15,807
People right

3390
02:46:16,063 --> 02:46:17,087
We could

3391
02:46:17,343 --> 02:46:18,367
Undo a lot of damage

3392
02:46:18,623 --> 02:46:19,135
Is that that

3393
02:46:19,903 --> 02:46:21,439
Can do

3394
02:46:21,695 --> 02:46:22,207
All proper

3395
02:46:24,255 --> 02:46:24,767
Actors

3396
02:46:25,791 --> 02:46:27,327
Yeah like the monsters

3397
02:46:27,583 --> 02:46:28,095
Yeah

3398
02:46:28,351 --> 02:46:29,887
But I think you can mitigate the damage

3399
02:46:30,399 --> 02:46:32,191
Pretended we live in society where

3400
02:46:32,447 --> 02:46:33,215
It's not a pain

3401
02:46:33,471 --> 02:46:33,983
It's not fair

3402
02:46:34,751 --> 02:46:35,519
It's not

3403
02:46:36,031 --> 02:46:37,055
Your behoove

3404
02:46:37,567 --> 02:46:38,335
To understand

3405
02:46:39,103 --> 02:46:40,383
Play self

3406
02:46:40,639 --> 02:46:41,663
Because those

3407
02:46:43,967 --> 02:46:49,855
How do you argue against almost in verse

3408
02:46:50,367 --> 02:46:51,647
Of the truth

3409
02:46:52,159 --> 02:46:55,231
Which again is going to be a far larger

3410
02:46:55,487 --> 02:46:55,999
Generalization

3411
02:46:57,535 --> 02:46:58,047
But

3412
02:46:58,303 --> 02:47:03,423
AA the metaphor would then be only 2% of the population studies logic

3413
02:47:04,191 --> 02:47:04,703
+ 98

3414
02:47:04,959 --> 02:47:05,983
Population does

3415
02:47:06,495 --> 02:47:07,007
Probably

3416
02:47:07,263 --> 02:47:10,847
Yeah right like you use a logic

3417
02:47:11,103 --> 02:47:17,247
Analog and I'm using it as a metaphor

3418
02:47:20,831 --> 02:47:22,623
Is that how is it that we

3419
02:47:22,879 --> 02:47:28,767
Educate people when the 2% is so insistent about not educating people

3420
02:47:29,023 --> 02:47:30,815
I get those two percent are billionaires

3421
02:47:31,071 --> 02:47:37,215
And the 2% that isn't isn't about educating the responsibility

3422
02:47:38,239 --> 02:47:40,287
Sarah lot of good actors out there

3423
02:47:41,567 --> 02:47:45,407
Like I talked I complain about rightwingwatch and Media Matters all the f****** time

3424
02:47:49,759 --> 02:47:50,783
Their heart is in the right place

3425
02:47:51,039 --> 02:47:51,807
Foreshore

3426
02:47:52,063 --> 02:47:55,903
And they do a good job of reporting on

3427
02:47:56,159 --> 02:47:56,671
Xbox

3428
02:47:57,183 --> 02:47:58,207
Thing that the right.

3429
02:47:58,463 --> 02:48:03,327
Now what they do report

3430
02:48:03,583 --> 02:48:04,863
Foundational problem with

3431
02:48:05,375 --> 02:48:05,887
They're fun

3432
02:48:07,423 --> 02:48:09,215
Whatever we're not going to fix it on this ship

3433
02:48:09,471 --> 02:48:11,263
And I'm at the same time I wish

3434
02:48:11,519 --> 02:48:12,799
This particularly Media Matters

3435
02:48:13,055 --> 02:48:13,823
When they posted

3436
02:48:14,079 --> 02:48:15,103
Videos that Devin

3437
02:48:15,359 --> 02:48:15,871
Straight A

3438
02:48:16,383 --> 02:48:18,175
Very important point I wish they would

3439
02:48:18,943 --> 02:48:19,455
SA

3440
02:48:19,711 --> 02:48:20,991
That explains why it's an

3441
02:48:21,247 --> 02:48:21,759
Important

3442
02:48:22,527 --> 02:48:23,039
You just post

3443
02:48:25,087 --> 02:48:26,111
People like Vic Berger

3444
02:48:26,367 --> 02:48:27,391
Post really awesome

3445
02:48:27,903 --> 02:48:28,415
Like

3446
02:48:29,695 --> 02:48:30,975
Proof that Mike cernovich

3447
02:48:31,231 --> 02:48:32,255
The f****** monster

3448
02:48:32,511 --> 02:48:33,023
You have exam

3449
02:48:35,583 --> 02:48:36,095
Doing

3450
02:48:36,607 --> 02:48:37,375
The

3451
02:48:37,631 --> 02:48:38,143
The work

3452
02:48:38,655 --> 02:48:40,191
Sam Cedar Michael Brooks

3453
02:48:40,447 --> 02:48:43,775
They're doing amazing work

3454
02:48:45,311 --> 02:48:46,079
You know what I'm saying

3455
02:48:47,871 --> 02:48:48,383
But the in

3456
02:48:48,639 --> 02:48:49,151
Inverse of 8

3457
02:48:49,919 --> 02:48:50,431
You only

3458
02:48:51,455 --> 02:48:51,967
A 2%

3459
02:48:52,479 --> 02:48:52,991
To fight

3460
02:48:57,855 --> 02:48:58,367
Look

3461
02:48:58,623 --> 02:48:59,903
I don't I'm not here to talk

3462
02:49:00,159 --> 02:49:05,535
In a weird ultimate battle of Good and Evil right now which I don't think it's how we should

3463
02:49:05,791 --> 02:49:11,935
It's just like the percent kind of thing

3464
02:49:12,191 --> 02:49:17,823
Like this

3465
02:49:19,359 --> 02:49:19,871
I think I

3466
02:49:21,919 --> 02:49:22,687
I believe is based on

3467
02:49:22,943 --> 02:49:23,967
All the research that I

3468
02:49:25,503 --> 02:49:26,271
Andover

3469
02:49:27,039 --> 02:49:27,807
Alex's primary

3470
02:49:28,063 --> 02:49:28,575
Sources

3471
02:49:29,343 --> 02:49:31,135
I really think that all it

3472
02:49:31,903 --> 02:49:32,415
Charismatic

3473
02:49:32,927 --> 02:49:34,207
Decently bad

3474
02:49:34,719 --> 02:49:35,231
Version

3475
02:49:36,511 --> 02:49:37,023
He does

3476
02:49:37,279 --> 02:49:38,047
In order to

3477
02:49:39,071 --> 02:49:39,583
Destroyah

3478
02:49:39,839 --> 02:49:40,351
Stuff

3479
02:49:40,863 --> 02:49:43,423
No all of it all of the propaganda

3480
02:49:43,679 --> 02:49:46,751
Be diffused all the propaganda

3481
02:49:47,007 --> 02:49:47,519
To a certain

3482
02:49:47,775 --> 02:49:48,543
Amount of yet

3483
02:49:49,055 --> 02:49:49,567
Bye

3484
02:49:50,079 --> 02:49:52,383
Discussing why the propaganda exist

3485
02:49:52,895 --> 02:49:54,175
Where it comes from

3486
02:49:54,431 --> 02:49:55,711
What isn't I'm tails

3487
02:49:55,967 --> 02:49:57,247
And where the problem is

3488
02:49:57,503 --> 02:49:58,527
Right you don't like that

3489
02:49:58,783 --> 02:49:59,295
That

3490
02:50:02,367 --> 02:50:02,879
Exist

3491
02:50:03,135 --> 02:50:04,415
Like that in a world

3492
02:50:04,671 --> 02:50:05,183
Where

3493
02:50:05,439 --> 02:50:06,207
The inverse

3494
02:50:06,719 --> 02:50:07,231
Is there

3495
02:50:07,743 --> 02:50:09,023
Amtrak

3496
02:50:09,279 --> 02:50:09,791
Push back against

3497
02:50:11,839 --> 02:50:12,863
I'm not just saying that because

3498
02:50:13,887 --> 02:50:14,399
Can we do

3499
02:50:14,655 --> 02:50:15,167
But like

3500
02:50:15,679 --> 02:50:16,191
Pushing back

3501
02:50:16,959 --> 02:50:17,471
Will help if

3502
02:50:18,239 --> 02:50:19,263
This is what I'm saying

3503
02:50:19,775 --> 02:50:20,799
We are

3504
02:50:21,311 --> 02:50:22,079
Uniquely place

3505
02:50:22,847 --> 02:50:23,359
Where in

3506
02:50:23,615 --> 02:50:24,895
You and I should run the world

3507
02:50:25,151 --> 02:50:27,199
Like always

3508
02:50:27,455 --> 02:50:33,599
Which of the following of

3509
02:50:33,855 --> 02:50:37,439
We should be doing exactly what we're doing quite frankly

3510
02:50:37,695 --> 02:50:39,487
The reason that this works

3511
02:50:39,999 --> 02:50:40,767
Is because of that

3512
02:50:41,023 --> 02:50:47,167
Prime Minister President dynamic

3513
02:50:47,423 --> 02:50:47,935
Breakdown

3514
02:50:48,191 --> 02:50:49,471
I think it's the most

3515
02:50:49,727 --> 02:50:50,495
Not the most

3516
02:50:51,263 --> 02:50:54,079
Incredibly important piece of our modern world that we have to deal with

3517
02:50:54,335 --> 02:50:55,103
And

3518
02:50:55,615 --> 02:50:56,127
Do whatever

3519
02:50:56,639 --> 02:50:59,199
I don't know I think that we've spawn off into like

3520
02:51:00,991 --> 02:51:02,783
Conversation is certainly very valid

3521
02:51:03,039 --> 02:51:05,855
But at the same time we wouldn't be having it if it weren't for

3522
02:51:06,367 --> 02:51:07,647
Lot of feelings that were having

3523
02:51:08,671 --> 02:51:09,695
The contact

3524
02:51:09,951 --> 02:51:12,767
Very clear like I can't stress enough

3525
02:51:13,791 --> 02:51:16,607
If you take the time to go read all the stuff that I've read

3526
02:51:16,863 --> 02:51:17,887
Did I try to

3527
02:51:18,143 --> 02:51:18,911
Expresses Best Buy

3528
02:51:19,935 --> 02:51:23,263
On this podcast without just sitting here to get home

3529
02:51:23,519 --> 02:51:24,799
Right

3530
02:51:25,567 --> 02:51:27,871
If you go and read it you will only see

3531
02:51:28,127 --> 02:51:30,431
See parallels

3532
02:51:30,943 --> 02:51:31,967
And Alex Jones

3533
02:51:32,735 --> 02:51:33,247
Personally

3534
02:51:33,503 --> 02:51:34,271
A hundred percent

3535
02:51:34,783 --> 02:51:35,807
And it was

3536
02:51:36,319 --> 02:51:37,087
Is World in 2000

3537
02:51:37,343 --> 02:51:39,135
Right now I don't know the month

3538
02:51:39,391 --> 02:51:40,159
Before this

3539
02:51:40,415 --> 02:51:40,927
You know

3540
02:51:41,183 --> 02:51:41,695
I don't know the months

3541
02:51:41,951 --> 02:51:43,743
Before this what what is rhetoric specific

3542
02:51:43,999 --> 02:51:45,791
Ugly was I don't know

3543
02:51:46,303 --> 02:51:46,815
I hate Muslims

3544
02:51:47,071 --> 02:51:48,095
And be really scared of them

3545
02:51:48,607 --> 02:51:49,631
But I do know that

3546
02:51:50,911 --> 02:51:51,935
If I had to choose

3547
02:51:53,983 --> 02:51:54,751
2009

3548
02:51:55,007 --> 02:51:55,519
2010

3549
02:51:56,287 --> 02:51:57,055
He's not like this

3550
02:51:57,823 --> 02:51:58,335
He is not

3551
02:51:58,847 --> 02:51:59,615
Someone who is

3552
02:51:59,871 --> 02:52:00,639
Basically

3553
02:52:00,895 --> 02:52:01,663
Regurgitate

3554
02:52:01,919 --> 02:52:02,431
Peter's brevik

3555
02:52:03,455 --> 02:52:04,735
Yeah and in 2018

3556
02:52:05,503 --> 02:52:06,015
He f****** it

3557
02:52:06,783 --> 02:52:07,551
He is 100 /

3558
02:52:08,063 --> 02:52:11,135
So is that guy

3559
02:52:11,391 --> 02:52:11,903
Totally

3560
02:52:12,159 --> 02:52:13,439
Don't don't kid

3561
02:52:14,463 --> 02:52:14,975
Yep

3562
02:52:15,231 --> 02:52:15,999
They're just

3563
02:52:16,255 --> 02:52:19,839
Praying another Anders Breivik shows up preferably in America

3564
02:52:21,119 --> 02:52:21,887
Because it wouldn't

3565
02:52:22,143 --> 02:52:22,911
You somehow just

3566
02:52:23,935 --> 02:52:24,447
Because they've done the pre

3567
02:52:24,959 --> 02:52:25,471
Groundwork

3568
02:52:25,983 --> 02:52:26,495
Of

3569
02:52:27,519 --> 02:52:28,031
If this happened

3570
02:52:30,847 --> 02:52:33,663
With all these other

3571
02:52:34,175 --> 02:52:34,687
F****** Terror

3572
02:52:36,479 --> 02:52:37,247
Shootings that have happened

3573
02:52:38,015 --> 02:52:40,319
A grade so we have one more clip here

3574
02:52:40,831 --> 02:52:43,903
This is sort of a

3575
02:52:44,927 --> 02:52:45,951
I could probably Alex being a

3576
02:52:46,463 --> 02:52:46,975
Disgusting

3577
02:52:47,999 --> 02:52:53,119
Terrorist.

3578
02:52:53,375 --> 02:52:55,167
Whatever

3579
02:52:55,679 --> 02:53:00,287
They are

3580
02:53:04,639 --> 02:53:08,991
It's for everybody

3581
02:53:12,575 --> 02:53:15,135
So the reason that I am feeling like

3582
02:53:15,391 --> 02:53:15,903
Clip for this

3583
02:53:18,975 --> 02:53:24,863
See there is a false call for solidarity

3584
02:53:25,119 --> 02:53:28,447
If he actually meant he was

3585
02:53:28,703 --> 02:53:30,495
Yeah I like that idea of like

3586
02:53:32,543 --> 02:53:34,079
East of us it happens to all of us

3587
02:53:34,335 --> 02:53:35,359
That that sort of thing

3588
02:53:36,895 --> 02:53:39,711
Because we know from his history we know

3589
02:53:42,015 --> 02:53:42,783
We know that he does

3590
02:53:43,295 --> 02:53:45,599
Really care all that much when it happened

3591
02:53:45,855 --> 02:53:46,367
Two other

3592
02:53:46,623 --> 02:53:47,391
Group

3593
02:53:47,647 --> 02:53:48,415
Always be

3594
02:53:49,951 --> 02:53:50,975
It would you even is

3595
02:53:51,231 --> 02:53:53,279
Expressing In that clip where you talked about like

3596
02:53:53,535 --> 02:53:54,047
You Bubba's

3597
02:53:54,559 --> 02:53:57,119
You know you think it's just there for

3598
02:53:57,375 --> 02:53:58,655
Are the Browns know it's every

3599
02:53:58,911 --> 02:54:01,983
You too but that goes back to why

3600
02:54:02,239 --> 02:54:05,311
We reacted so heavily or why especially you react

3601
02:54:06,847 --> 02:54:08,895
When you made that realization of

3602
02:54:09,663 --> 02:54:14,783
His biggest problem was not all of these atrocities being committed

3603
02:54:15,039 --> 02:54:17,855
It said he thought they might eventually be committed

3604
02:54:18,111 --> 02:54:18,879
Two white people

3605
02:54:19,903 --> 02:54:21,439
So in this situation

3606
02:54:21,695 --> 02:54:25,791
When he's living in 2011 when he's living with black president

3607
02:54:26,047 --> 02:54:26,815
When he's living with

3608
02:54:27,071 --> 02:54:27,839
All of these

3609
02:54:28,351 --> 02:54:29,375
These ideas that he

3610
02:54:31,167 --> 02:54:31,679
Of course he

3611
02:54:31,935 --> 02:54:32,703
He's terrified

3612
02:54:32,959 --> 02:54:33,983
Because he thinks

3613
02:54:34,239 --> 02:54:35,007
Finally

3614
02:54:35,263 --> 02:54:37,055
Going to get traded

3615
02:54:38,079 --> 02:54:39,871
And now he's totally fine with this

3616
02:54:40,127 --> 02:54:41,407
Depression because he knows

3617
02:54:41,919 --> 02:54:42,431
F*** it

3618
02:54:42,687 --> 02:54:44,223
White

3619
02:54:44,479 --> 02:54:45,759
Even though he's wrong

3620
02:54:46,271 --> 02:54:47,039
Even though he's

3621
02:54:47,295 --> 02:54:49,087
Utterly and completely wrong

3622
02:54:49,343 --> 02:54:52,159
Even though white people are bored

3623
02:54:52,415 --> 02:54:55,743
Currently by what he thinks makes sense for white

3624
02:54:55,999 --> 02:55:00,351
He still thinks that virtual

3625
02:55:00,607 --> 02:55:01,119
Novice

3626
02:55:02,143 --> 02:55:02,911
He's going to be fine

3627
02:55:03,423 --> 02:55:04,447
Yeah well he's rich

3628
02:55:05,983 --> 02:55:06,751
You won't be soon

3629
02:55:07,007 --> 02:55:07,775
Let's hope

3630
02:55:08,287 --> 02:55:09,567
I don't think he's going to get away from

3631
02:55:10,079 --> 02:55:11,359
At least

3632
02:55:13,919 --> 02:55:14,943
AOL

3633
02:55:17,503 --> 02:55:18,015
I'm that's that

3634
02:55:19,551 --> 02:55:22,111
I think that last clip really perfectly sums up

3635
02:55:22,367 --> 02:55:23,135
Like what the

3636
02:55:23,647 --> 02:55:24,415
The f*****-up

3637
02:55:24,927 --> 02:55:25,439
Part of Alex

3638
02:55:25,695 --> 02:55:26,975
Jones especially

3639
02:55:27,743 --> 02:55:28,767
2011 onward

3640
02:55:29,535 --> 02:55:30,303
I don't know where to put the

3641
02:55:30,559 --> 02:55:31,071
The beginning point

3642
02:55:32,095 --> 02:55:32,607
Is it like

3643
02:55:32,863 --> 02:55:34,143
Actually

3644
02:55:36,447 --> 02:55:39,007
Yeah like he's good

3645
02:55:39,519 --> 02:55:40,543
But it's coded line

3646
02:55:41,055 --> 02:55:41,823
You know like it's not

3647
02:55:42,335 --> 02:55:42,847
It's not like

3648
02:55:43,359 --> 02:55:44,383
Face value

3649
02:55:45,151 --> 02:55:48,223
Like this idea of like we hang together or we hang

3650
02:55:48,991 --> 02:55:49,759
Like in terms of

3651
02:55:50,271 --> 02:55:51,551
All the people who are having

3652
02:55:52,063 --> 02:55:53,855
Their rights taken away and all that

3653
02:55:54,111 --> 02:55:54,623
If you ask

3654
02:55:55,903 --> 02:55:56,415
You would be

3655
02:55:57,695 --> 02:55:58,207
Champion

3656
02:55:58,975 --> 02:55:59,487
People

3657
02:55:59,743 --> 02:56:00,511
Who are white

3658
02:56:01,023 --> 02:56:01,535
Who

3659
02:56:01,791 --> 02:56:02,559
Are having to write

3660
02:56:05,631 --> 02:56:08,703
You would have years ago been talking about the private private prisons

3661
02:56:09,215 --> 02:56:09,983
Right where you would have been

3662
02:56:11,519 --> 02:56:12,287
These like really

3663
02:56:12,799 --> 02:56:18,943
People might wind up in private road

3664
02:56:19,455 --> 02:56:20,735
There's a lot of

3665
02:56:20,991 --> 02:56:21,759
Different ways

3666
02:56:22,015 --> 02:56:23,295
Narrative

3667
02:56:25,855 --> 02:56:26,367
That was really

3668
02:56:27,391 --> 02:56:28,927
Yeah

3669
02:56:29,183 --> 02:56:30,207
Yes

3670
02:56:31,999 --> 02:56:32,767
Find out is that

3671
02:56:38,399 --> 02:56:39,167
For us guys

3672
02:56:39,423 --> 02:56:40,447
If we don't

3673
02:56:40,703 --> 02:56:41,471
Push back

3674
02:56:41,727 --> 02:56:42,751
Also

3675
02:56:43,263 --> 02:56:43,775
At the same time

3676
02:56:44,799 --> 02:56:45,823
We care about

3677
02:56:46,079 --> 02:56:46,591
The actual

3678
02:56:47,871 --> 02:56:49,919
Remind me

3679
02:56:50,175 --> 02:56:50,687
Much

3680
02:56:50,943 --> 02:56:52,991
Of when I would make a

3681
02:56:53,247 --> 02:56:54,015
A cogent argument

3682
02:56:54,527 --> 02:56:55,039
That's

3683
02:56:55,551 --> 02:56:56,575
My family couldn't

3684
02:56:56,831 --> 02:56:57,343
Handle

3685
02:56:57,599 --> 02:56:58,367
Regarding

3686
02:56:58,879 --> 02:56:59,647
Christianity

3687
02:56:59,903 --> 02:57:00,671
And how it's a

3688
02:57:01,183 --> 02:57:03,487
Like even what they believe they have

3689
02:57:03,743 --> 02:57:04,511
Perversely

3690
02:57:05,023 --> 02:57:05,535
Asteroid

3691
02:57:06,303 --> 02:57:08,607
Their response was always a biblical

3692
02:57:08,863 --> 02:57:09,887
Call passage that said

3693
02:57:10,143 --> 02:57:11,423
Even the devil can quote

3694
02:57:11,679 --> 02:57:12,447
What scripture

3695
02:57:12,703 --> 02:57:14,495
Like when Alex Jones says that

3696
02:57:15,007 --> 02:57:16,287
When Alex Jones says what

3697
02:57:16,543 --> 02:57:17,055
You

3698
02:57:20,127 --> 02:57:25,247
Even the devil can quote scripture man you know like that kind

3699
02:57:25,503 --> 02:57:27,295
Describe that

3700
02:57:27,551 --> 02:57:28,319
I have

3701
02:57:30,367 --> 02:57:31,135
Has been emotional

3702
02:57:32,671 --> 02:57:33,695
Very difficult

3703
02:57:34,975 --> 02:57:35,743
Wrestling

3704
02:57:35,999 --> 02:57:36,511
Brevik

3705
02:57:38,047 --> 02:57:40,863
Thank you Sonia until I die

3706
02:57:41,119 --> 02:57:41,887
I want

3707
02:57:43,423 --> 02:57:45,983
I think I think that I've made my point

3708
02:57:46,239 --> 02:57:48,287
My specific points are

3709
02:57:49,055 --> 02:57:49,567
Andrews

3710
02:57:50,847 --> 02:57:51,871
Manifesto

3711
02:57:52,383 --> 02:57:53,151
Very clearly

3712
02:57:53,663 --> 02:57:54,175
Exactly

3713
02:57:56,223 --> 02:57:57,247
Especially in modern

3714
02:57:57,759 --> 02:57:59,039
Panda Express

3715
02:58:00,831 --> 02:58:01,343
Goodbye most

3716
02:58:03,135 --> 02:58:04,415
Tyranny of the Republic

3717
02:58:09,279 --> 02:58:09,791
Yep

3718
02:58:11,583 --> 02:58:14,143
I want to because it's been so so much

3719
02:58:14,399 --> 02:58:15,167
I want to

3720
02:58:15,679 --> 02:58:16,191
Let you

3721
02:58:16,703 --> 02:58:17,727
Have the floor

3722
02:58:18,239 --> 02:58:19,519
For final word

3723
02:58:20,287 --> 02:58:22,079
Call Dan

3724
02:58:22,335 --> 02:58:23,359
I'll tell you something

3725
02:58:23,615 --> 02:58:24,895
We're retired

3726
02:58:27,711 --> 02:58:30,527
No no no no no

3727
02:58:31,039 --> 02:58:31,807
I meant do you have any

3728
02:58:32,063 --> 02:58:32,831
Any last thoughts about

3729
02:58:33,087 --> 02:58:34,111
About that because I

3730
02:58:34,623 --> 02:58:35,391
Business sofa

3731

Heavy

3732
02:58:37,183 --> 02:58:38,207
Actual source

3733
02:58:39,231 --> 02:58:40,767
We've been joking around a bit

3734
02:58:41,023 --> 02:58:41,535
I only

3735
02:58:41,791 --> 02:58:42,303
I only

3736
02:58:44,607 --> 02:58:45,375
Of my preparation

3737
02:58:45,887 --> 02:58:47,679
The show I feel like I've been able to get my

3738
02:58:47,935 --> 02:58:48,959
Across

3739
02:58:49,215 --> 02:58:50,239
If you have any other points

3740
02:58:50,751 --> 02:58:51,263
You want to make

3741
02:58:51,775 --> 02:58:52,287
It's

3742
02:58:52,543 --> 02:58:53,567
I feel like it's stanced

3743
02:58:56,383 --> 02:58:57,663
You have one

3744
02:58:57,919 --> 02:58:58,431

I a

3749
02:59:03,551 --> 02:59:04,063
I am

3750
02:59:05,599 --> 02:59:06,367
Professional

3751

Handle my own

3752
02:59:14,303 --> 02:59:16,095
As we were as we were talking about

3753
02:59:18,143 --> 02:59:20,447
I've gone through such this level of

3754
02:59:20,703 --> 02:59:21,727
I have to react

3755
02:59:22,495 --> 02:59:23,007
Lizard brain

3756
02:59:23,263 --> 02:59:23,775
Enough like

3757
02:59:24,031 --> 02:59:24,799
This guy should be

3758
02:59:25,823 --> 02:59:27,871
And throughout this whole episode

3759
02:59:28,127 --> 02:59:29,919
I'm going back and forth

3760
02:59:30,431 --> 02:59:32,223
Yes he should be by all

3761
02:59:32,735 --> 02:59:34,527
Concept of objective

3762
02:59:34,783 --> 02:59:36,831
This is what he deserves

3763
02:59:38,367 --> 02:59:39,391
The only way

3764
02:59:39,647 --> 02:59:40,415
Prove that

3765
02:59:42,463 --> 02:59:44,255
His worldview is incorrect

3766
02:59:44,511 --> 02:59:46,047
Is to treat him humanely

3767
02:59:46,559 --> 02:59:49,375
It is to it is to accept that

3768
02:59:49,631 --> 02:59:51,423
The reality is

3769
02:59:51,935 --> 02:59:52,959
Vengeance only

3770
02:59:53,215 --> 02:59:53,983
Creates more vent

3771
02:59:54,495 --> 02:59:56,543
Only creates more destruction

3772
02:59:57,055 --> 03:00:00,639
Etc

3773
03:00:02,943 --> 03:00:03,967
Getting mad at

3774
03:00:05,759 --> 03:00:06,271
Perpetuate

3775
03:00:06,783 --> 03:00:07,551
What created

3776
03:00:08,831 --> 03:00:09,343
Stomach

3777
03:00:09,599 --> 03:00:11,391
Dealing with infants

3778
03:00:11,903 --> 03:00:12,415
Diffuser

3779
03:00:12,927 --> 03:00:14,463
They are in it

3780
03:00:14,719 --> 03:00:15,999
It is amazing

3781
03:00:16,511 --> 03:00:18,047
It is really amazing

3782
03:00:18,559 --> 03:00:19,327
How

3783
03:00:20,607 --> 03:00:21,887
The Master's tools

3784
03:00:22,911 --> 03:00:24,703
Will never destroy the Masters

3785
03:00:26,239 --> 03:00:27,519
Like that is

3786
03:00:29,567 --> 03:00:30,335
S*** now I have to

3787
03:00:30,591 --> 03:00:31,359
Look up

3788
03:00:32,895 --> 03:00:35,199
Absolutely not

3789
03:00:35,455 --> 03:00:37,503
I love to look her up

3790
03:00:37,759 --> 03:00:39,295
Audre Lorde

3791
03:00:39,551 --> 03:00:40,575
Okay

3792
03:00:41,087 --> 03:00:42,111
Audre Lorde

3793
03:00:42,367 --> 03:00:43,647
Wrote an essay

3794
03:00:43,903 --> 03:00:44,415
Regarding

3795
03:00:45,695 --> 03:00:46,463
That is

3796
03:00:46,975 --> 03:00:47,743
Simply like

3797
03:00:49,279 --> 03:00:50,815
So-so app

3798
03:00:51,071 --> 03:00:52,351
Proposed for so many different

3799
03:00:53,375 --> 03:00:55,935
Like to a certain extent you can apply

3800
03:00:56,191 --> 03:00:56,703
Democracy

3801
03:00:57,215 --> 03:00:59,263
The Master's tools are democracy

3802
03:00:59,519 --> 03:01:01,567
Or are they the oligarch

3803
03:01:02,079 --> 03:01:06,175
Are they

3804
03:01:06,687 --> 03:01:07,711
What are those

3805
03:01:10,271 --> 03:01:12,575
The Master's tools

3806
03:01:14,623 --> 03:01:16,159
Toxic masculinity

3807
03:01:16,671 --> 03:01:18,719
And that is always coming down to

3808
03:01:18,975 --> 03:01:19,999
Violence solves

3809
03:01:20,511 --> 03:01:23,071
Poetry

3810
03:01:26,399 --> 03:01:28,703
Fix a let me have the flu

3811
03:01:30,495 --> 03:01:31,775
No problem

3812
03:01:34,591 --> 03:01:35,103
There's a lot of interest

3813
03:01:37,407 --> 03:01:37,919
Used to wrestle with

3814
03:01:40,223 --> 03:01:40,735
Pictures of like

3815
03:01:41,759 --> 03:01:43,807
When they go low we go high

3816
03:01:44,063 --> 03:01:44,831
That lost

3817
03:01:45,087 --> 03:01:45,599
Man

3818
03:01:45,855 --> 03:01:46,623
We lost

3819
03:01:52,255 --> 03:01:52,767
The election

3820
03:01:56,351 --> 03:01:56,863
Like in terms of

3821
03:01:59,935 --> 03:02:02,239
I don't know we had a mass shooting today

3822
03:02:03,519 --> 03:02:04,799
So what

3823
03:02:05,311 --> 03:02:07,615
Did Anders Breivik lose

3824
03:02:08,383 --> 03:02:10,175
Every day we have every

3825
03:02:10,431 --> 03:02:10,943
What

3826
03:02:11,199 --> 03:02:11,711
Weekly

3827
03:02:12,479 --> 03:02:12,991
Monthly

3828
03:02:13,247 --> 03:02:14,015
He didn't lose

3829
03:02:18,111 --> 03:02:20,415
How do we how do we make them lose

3830
03:02:20,671 --> 03:02:21,183
Is the

3831
03:02:21,439 --> 03:02:24,255
Question of our time how do we destroyed

3832
03:02:24,767 --> 03:02:27,839
Because we're no longer conversation we had earlier

3833
03:02:28,351 --> 03:02:28,863
Yeah

3834
03:02:29,375 --> 03:02:30,143
Refusing to propagate

3835
03:02:30,399 --> 03:02:33,727
We're no longer in a place where we can

3836
03:02:34,239 --> 03:02:38,335
Like with all of the bulshit eulogies about

3837
03:02:38,591 --> 03:02:39,615
John McCain

3838
03:02:40,127 --> 03:02:44,479
Look my again my initial reaction is.

3839
03:02:45,503 --> 03:02:47,295
But with those eulogies

3840
03:02:47,807 --> 03:02:49,599
What they are trying to point to

3841
03:02:49,855 --> 03:02:51,135
Is a

3842
03:02:51,391 --> 03:02:57,023
Pastor hearkening to an emotional appeal

3843
03:02:58,559 --> 03:03:03,423
Acts like this idea of there was a time where

3844
03:03:03,679 --> 03:03:05,727
Arguments were about policy

3845
03:03:06,239 --> 03:03:07,519
And not about reality

3846
03:03:09,055 --> 03:03:10,079
The emotional truth is

3847
03:03:11,615 --> 03:03:12,127
Them for

3848
03:03:12,383 --> 03:03:12,895
Feeling

3849
03:03:13,151 --> 03:03:16,991
Is that

3850
03:03:17,247 --> 03:03:18,783
Is

3851
03:03:19,295 --> 03:03:22,879
I think lowering taxes improves our economy

3852
03:03:23,135 --> 03:03:23,903
And you think

3853
03:03:24,159 --> 03:03:29,535
Raising taxes on the rich

3854
03:03:30,303 --> 03:03:33,119
I think that immigrants are killing everybody

3855
03:03:33,375 --> 03:03:35,167
And I think that

3856
03:03:36,703 --> 03:03:40,799
And weird Rays from Antarctica

3857
03:03:41,055 --> 03:03:47,199
Hurricane

3858
03:03:47,711 --> 03:03:53,087
He's not allowed on Alex's show

3859
03:03:53,343 --> 03:03:54,879
Hey you lost your tenure at

3860
03:03:55,135 --> 03:03:57,695
Uc-davis congratulation is that means

3861
03:03:59,999 --> 03:04:01,791
Alex anymore

3862
03:04:02,303 --> 03:04:04,351
But you still got a place hamamoto my baby

3863
03:04:04,607 --> 03:04:07,679
Call Mija

3864
03:04:08,447 --> 03:04:14,591
538

3865
03:04:14,847 --> 03:04:15,615
Such a

3866
03:04:16,895 --> 03:04:17,407
I

3867
03:04:19,711 --> 03:04:22,015
I want to live in a world where we can have a conversation

3868
03:04:22,783 --> 03:04:25,855
Yeah and we don't live in that world and we have to accept that

3869
03:04:26,111 --> 03:04:26,879
We met

3870
03:04:27,135 --> 03:04:30,463
We may live in that world but that is going to require

3871
03:04:30,719 --> 03:04:31,487
Defeat

3872
03:04:31,743 --> 03:04:33,535
I'm going to require not

3873
03:04:33,791 --> 03:04:35,327
Compromised

3874
03:04:35,583 --> 03:04:38,399
Am not coexistence that is going to require

3875
03:04:40,191 --> 03:04:40,959
Of the right

3876
03:04:41,983 --> 03:04:43,007
This is where we get in

3877
03:04:43,263 --> 03:04:43,775
Into

3878
03:04:44,287 --> 03:04:45,055
Another half hour of

3879
03:04:45,311 --> 03:04:45,823
Conversation

3880
03:04:46,079 --> 03:04:48,127
Because I don't think you and I have never done

3881
03:04:50,943 --> 03:04:51,711
You're expressing

3882
03:04:52,223 --> 03:04:53,247
Is dangerously

3883
03:04:53,503 --> 03:04:54,271
We close to

3884
03:04:56,575 --> 03:04:57,599
I mean politically

3885
03:05:00,415 --> 03:05:00,927
It requires

3886
03:05:01,183 --> 03:05:02,463
Nothing out of

3887
03:05:02,719 --> 03:05:03,743
In order for us to

3888
03:05:03,999 --> 03:05:04,511
Come to a place

3889
03:05:05,023 --> 03:05:08,607
Again of mutual respect

3890
03:05:08,863 --> 03:05:09,375
Define

3891
03:05:10,911 --> 03:05:11,423
Buganda

3892
03:05:11,935 --> 03:05:13,215
Because what has happened

3893
03:05:13,727 --> 03:05:14,239
To the right

3894
03:05:14,751 --> 03:05:15,519
Is a case

3895
03:05:15,775 --> 03:05:16,287
Study

3896
03:05:16,543 --> 03:05:18,079
In propaganda run-amok

3897
03:05:20,127 --> 03:05:22,175
No everyone wants to say because blood

3898
03:05:22,431 --> 03:05:22,943
People sell books

3899
03:05:23,455 --> 03:05:24,735
Based on this

3900
03:05:25,247 --> 03:05:26,271
Russia

3901
03:05:26,527 --> 03:05:27,295
Has done that

3902
03:05:27,551 --> 03:05:28,575
Or whatever

3903
03:05:29,343 --> 03:05:29,855
Irrelevant

3904
03:05:30,111 --> 03:05:31,391
I know that's irrelevant

3905
03:05:31,903 --> 03:05:32,671
It is a proper

3906
03:05:32,927 --> 03:05:33,439
Buganda f

3907
03:05:33,695 --> 03:05:34,975
Has happened to the right

3908
03:05:35,487 --> 03:05:37,279
Here's what the source of it

3909
03:05:38,303 --> 03:05:38,815
There is

3910
03:05:39,839 --> 03:05:40,607
Radicalization

3911
03:05:41,631 --> 03:05:42,399
That is not

3912
03:05:43,167 --> 03:05:44,191
Been seen in my life

3913
03:05:48,031 --> 03:05:48,543
Normal

3914
03:05:48,799 --> 03:05:49,311
Anyway

3915
03:05:50,079 --> 03:05:50,591
But it's

3916
03:05:50,847 --> 03:05:51,359
Cambion

3917
03:05:51,615 --> 03:05:52,127
Done

3918
03:05:52,383 --> 03:05:52,895
Bye

3919
03:05:53,663 --> 03:05:54,943
Wrestling with a prophet

3920
03:05:55,199 --> 03:05:56,223
Humanistic

3921
03:05:57,759 --> 03:05:59,039
I apologize if

3922
03:05:59,551 --> 03:06:03,647
That wasn't made clear defeat of the right is like

3923
03:06:04,159 --> 03:06:07,231
Defeat of the

3924
03:06:08,255 --> 03:06:11,071
I like that concept of like

3925
03:06:11,327 --> 03:06:16,959
Defeat of the world that we live in where that is the right

3926
03:06:17,215 --> 03:06:19,519
Exactly

3927
03:06:19,775 --> 03:06:21,567
Play I don't mean to defeat of these

3928
03:06:21,823 --> 03:06:24,383
People I mean a realistic

3929
03:06:25,151 --> 03:06:26,431
This is not

3930
03:06:26,687 --> 03:06:28,479
Acceptable and we

3931
03:06:28,735 --> 03:06:29,503
All agree on

3932
03:06:30,015 --> 03:06:32,063
And that is going to require

3933
03:06:32,319 --> 03:06:33,599
Like what it is

3934
03:06:33,855 --> 03:06:37,183
Wouldn't take for slavery not to be okay

3935
03:06:37,951 --> 03:06:41,535
Require

3936
03:06:42,047 --> 03:06:45,119
Nothing like does require

3937
03:06:45,375 --> 03:06:49,727
Story about the Civil War stuff today

3938
03:06:49,983 --> 03:06:52,799
Delray

3939
03:06:53,823 --> 03:06:54,591
That's states rights

3940
03:06:55,359 --> 03:07:00,735
8

3941
03:07:00,991 --> 03:07:02,783
Verily

3942
03:07:03,295 --> 03:07:04,063
Dismiss

3943
03:07:04,319 --> 03:07:07,647
As a whole to the point

3944
03:07:07,903 --> 03:07:08,927
To this propaganda

3945
03:07:09,183 --> 03:07:13,023
Have to except for 30 years until they start building Confederate Monument

3946
03:07:13,791 --> 03:07:14,815
In order to make sure that

3947
03:07:15,327 --> 03:07:17,375
You know it ain't me it's going to require that

3948
03:07:17,631 --> 03:07:18,655
But it also requires

3949
03:07:18,911 --> 03:07:19,679
Humility from people

3950
03:07:19,935 --> 03:07:20,959
As well

3951
03:07:23,519 --> 03:07:24,799
Life but there is a prop

3952
03:07:26,079 --> 03:07:27,359
Version of Alexa

3953
03:07:28,127 --> 03:07:32,991
Distance to the left like commitment to the status quo

3954
03:07:37,087 --> 03:07:37,599
Middle-west

3955
03:07:38,111 --> 03:07:38,623

Exactly

3958
03:07:41,695 --> 03:07:42,719

We've been able to get to

3974
03:08:34,687 --> 03:08:35,967
The dark

3975
03:08:36,223 --> 03:08:37,503
Awful

3976
03:08:37,759 --> 03:08:39,295

You want us to do

3988
03:09:04,127 --> 03:09:04,895
Forget about any mess

3989
03:09:07,455 --> 03:09:07,967

Everything's come back

3994
03:09:16,159 --> 03:09:17,951

03:09:18,207 --> 03:09:19,231

4002
03:09:28,447 --> 03:09:32,031
It's important to remember that for one time travel request

4003
03:09:32,287 --> 03:09:33,567
Dan has spent the last

4004
03:09:33,823 --> 03:09:36,127
48 Hours fighting sleep

4005
03:09:36,383 --> 03:09:36,895
More than that

4006
03:09:37,151 --> 03:09:38,431

4007
03:09:38,943 --> 03:09:42,527

03:09:45,343 --> 03:09:45,855
F******

4011
03:09:46,111 --> 03:09:47,391
Serious about research

4012
03:09:51,743 --> 03:09:52,255
Forgotten about

4013
03:09:53,279 --> 03:09:54,559
I need a reminder

4014
03:09:54,815 --> 03:09:55,327
So please

4015
03:09:55,583 --> 03:09:56,607
Please remind me

4016
03:09:57,119 --> 03:10:00,703
Call the timeout

4017
03:10:01,727 --> 03:10:02,495
The Cavs game

4018
03:10:03,007 --> 03:10:04,287
David Blatt

4019
03:10:04,543 --> 03:10:05,055
You're like

4020
03:10:05,311 --> 03:10:08,895
We need to call a timeout but you didn't have any timeouts left and then LeBron

4021
03:10:09,151 --> 03:10:11,967
Overturned you but

4022
03:10:12,223 --> 03:10:14,015
Fired a f****** buzzer beater

4023
03:10:14,271 --> 03:10:15,551
That was against the rules

4024
03:10:15,807 --> 03:10:19,391
And Derrick Rose was still great at the time anyway

4025
03:10:19,647 --> 03:10:21,183
Miami book fair

4026
03:10:21,695 --> 03:10:22,207
Derrick Rose

4027
03:10:22,719 --> 03:10:27,583
But it's there

4028
03:10:27,839 --> 03:10:29,631
But while we're talking about monsters

4029
03:10:30,143 --> 03:10:31,423
It's only right that I remind you

4030
03:10:32,703 --> 03:10:33,471
Probably killed

4031
03:10:35,007 --> 03:10:37,055
