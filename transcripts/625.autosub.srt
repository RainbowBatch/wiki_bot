00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,216
My bright spot today Jordan

11
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,776
Is at Mariano's

12
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:18,592

Mariano's in pretty good like I hear that a lot for everything at Mariano's

24
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,552
But I can say that I am shocked

25
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,344
By the consistency

26
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,368
Of

27
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,160

00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,616
Go to Gerbes just for

34
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,664

Every store in town.

37
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,528
Growing up where I did

They had somebody there who is like f******

00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,608
This place is a desert

44
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,936
Yeah they went for it man they make

45
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:52,032
I think I must have seen something on TV about like that great barbecue place that's in the

46
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:57,664
Gas station

47
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,760
Switch to Russian

48
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,040
A little bit similar

49
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,160
Took the argyle stop today which I normally do anymore

50
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:11,488
It's been a long time since I've taken the argyle Saturday

51
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:17,888
And right underneath that it's under construction of the right underneath that was the bodega that I used to go to every time we work

52
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,168
Recorded at your old place

53
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,824
Yeah I don't know the one you're talking about years or whatever

54
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:30,688
It looks like it was struggling

55
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:36,576
I used to live in the neighborhood number of years back

56
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,368
Goddamn places still there

57
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,928
Wow you are not taking that place out

58
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:46,560
Good for them. The construction and they're still going I used to live over near there

59
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,608
A couple years back and

60
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:56,032
Would get on the argyle stop to go to work I would work I work at the end or south

61
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,312
The red line

62
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:00,128
And I would go into that but they go pretty much

63
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,688
Everyday before going into

64
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:06,528
I just walk around like you got nothing in here

65
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,600
Every morning

66
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,880
Like I just want

67
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,952
Debbie or something I don't know

68
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,256
Nothing is amazing

69
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,815
It really is but good on them surviving

70
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,839
Somehow

71
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:22,143
Jordan today we're going to be talking about

72
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,959

So this is this is what you think I think

76
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,711
Play a little bit of ketchup

77
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,783
You got on some of the narratives maybe that we missed

78
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:42,623
Well we are taking our 2003 sabbatical

79
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,415

81
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,279

00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,191
It was

93
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,727
Our timing was way off cuz

94
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,751
As we were at we were gone

95
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,055

As soon as I came out of my mouth

103
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,479
I think we might have shouted

104
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,759
Already

105
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,551
I can't tell if we did

106
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,855
My bad

107
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:21,183

108
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,999
So Sunday Alex's is a

109
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,535
Weekend

110
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,559
Maybe lower steak

111
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:32,191
Who knows little little light on the light on the loafers there starts off

112
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,215
Pretty hot

113
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,055
Tuesday

114
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:41,663
Police

115
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,967
Personal drip

116
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,527
Hundreds of thousands of pages of documents

117
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,319
Report on the 1st

118
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,623
It came out

119
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,719
Those first 30 pages of

120
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,303
Total Criminal

121
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,095
Admission

122
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,167
First

123
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,703
Beginning of the

124
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,727
Show called vaccine

125
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,287
Pfizer

126
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,823
Causing thousands of death

127
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:15,967
Farms in new and covered it up well guess what

128
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:20,063
Facebook Instagram they're all censoring even medical doctors

129
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:20,831
I mean

130
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:23,903
Go to prison executives

131
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,023
And word is Jack Dorsey

132
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,631
He had to step down

133
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,703
Right off the bat like it's super fun

134
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,471
Decide to make up

135
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,263
The story about why Jack step down

136
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,287
Like a quitter

137
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:47,967
To fit in perfectly with the dumb conspiracy theories Alex pitching at that time

138
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,503
We help them out it was nice of jacked

139
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:55,903
The reality is that it's more likely that the investors in Twitter had put pressure on Jack to decide to either step down

140
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,439
Is the CEO of Twitter or

141
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,207
Square

142
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,487
Since they're both Jake Gant

143
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,255
Attic businesses

144
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:06,911
Snbc news reported prior to Jack stepping down he was quote the only person to be CEO of to public

145
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,191
Market valuation

146
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,983
The greater than five billion dollars

147
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,287
That's not that's no good

148
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,079
Yeah there been

149
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:17,663
Tensions between the investment firms that are on Twitter's board

150
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,199
A chemist feels like a lot more

151
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,991
Kind of that sort of thing

152
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,015
And if I were Jack

153
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:28,415
Ceo.of I would totally go

154
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,439
Square

155
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:33,279
Processing is way better than a load of s*** people running Twitter after deal with

156
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,303
Which is

157
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,583
Is a lot of it is their own fault

158
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,399
Problems

159
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:45,055
Or maybe The globalist Wanted Twitter to censor IPA document to Jack said no so he stepped down as a CEO the five billion dollar

160
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,847
Just for the principle of it

161
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,895
They decided to stay mum on the topic

162
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:55,295
Could be a possibility lately who quit or or Studio

163
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:58,367
Up to the censorship generally they've done so very quiet

164
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,647
And off

165
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,183
Sing with I kind of stayed at

166
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,207
Usher

167
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:07,327
I can't wait for him to go on Rogan and talk about how he was forced out of quitter

168
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,375
They wouldn't allow the censorship of

169
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:16,287
So I'm certain these FDA documents that Alex is talking about aren't being censored on Twitter

170
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,311
Just fine

171
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:23,455
I would guess that maybe Twitter could be blocking links to blog posts about the documents on sites like natural news

172
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,247
Things that have been already

173
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,551
He kicked off because of the bulshit

174
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,087
Yeah there's going on

175
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:35,743
A group called the public health and medical professionals for transparency if they filed a foia request

176
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:36,511
After the FDA

177
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:39,327
To release all documents related to the Pfizer vaccine

178
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,911
And then sued them under production schedule wasn't what they had request

179
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:50,079
This case is a little complicated though and the FDA have suggested that they might need a deadline of 55 years

180
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,871
From now to fully produce the request

181
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,639
The documents

182
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,175
Which is approximately

183
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:57,759
329000 Pages worth of material

184
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:04,159
That might have been asking for too much could you narrow down your request

185
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,231
Do they want everything

186
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,255
Give them everything

187
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,279
Almost

188
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,327
Comically long amount of time but this is

189
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,607
Huge amount of

190
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:16,959
In order to release them to the public by way of soya they need to review all of the

191
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:20,799
To redact all sorts of things like Pfizer's confidential business information

192
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,103
Any possible identifying information about the

193
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,895
The participants in the clinical trials

194
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:28,479
Busy huge undertaking and I don't know if it takes 55

195
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,759
Years to get through all that

196
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,039
But I can see why it wouldn't

197
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:35,647
Pick 4 months which was the initial request line from the group bring the suit

198
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:42,047
I want them to go ahead with the 55-year at this is like what this is like the Voyager now this is like we're sending it off

199
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:46,655
Who knows what'll come back with 55 years from now

200
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,591
November 15th

201
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:59,455
Pleading the FDA requested that they released batches of the initial documents on November 7th

202
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,735
19th and December 1st

203
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,527
And thereafter they quote

204
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:06,623
Propose to process and produce the non-exempt portions of responsive record

205
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,671
At a rate of 500 pages per

206
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,231
This is a tough situation and I can

207
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,767
Time to see both sides of it

208
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,839
I think they probably 500 pages

209
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,607
Sump pump is

210
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,911
Buying I don't know no no

211
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:23,007
So I'm really interested to see what's going on here and I needed to learn a little bit more

212
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:23,775
Like really

213
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,543
You know

214
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,311
Put my foot

215
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,335
Down somewhere

216
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,895
Immediately reading over some of these court documents

217
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,175
The way the plaintiff

218
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:33,247
Speaker group of doctors with that with the way they're presented themselves

219
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,527
Didn't sit quite right with

220
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:42,207
Thinking they was going to go in their initial petition to the court they seem to be attempted to come off as if their concerns they were based on

221
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:44,255
Desire to provide information that are

222
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,535
It will quiet

223
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,303
Axiom Skeptics

224
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,655
Releasing this data should also

225
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:54,239
Confirm the fda's conclusion that the Pfizer vaccine is safe and effective

226
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,775
Have us increased confidence

227
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,055
It's in the Pfizer vaccine

228
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:00,127
Is that where the motives of someone were following Aika

229
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,407
Can totally understand that

230
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,967
But there's just a tone in their second filing

231
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:10,623
The Joint status report that makes me think that this group might be a little bit anti-vaccine

232
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,415
Will kill all of you

233
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:18,815
There's some strange B like them insisting that the FDA produce the documents in 108 days if that's how long it took

234
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,399
Remind Pfizer began producing document until the vaccine

235
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,983
Target

236
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,287
Another part reads quote

237
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:34,943
In any event the FDA should welcome making these documents available to the plaintiff if it's confident in the analysis and review it

238
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:42,111
Nail and taking such an absurd and unconscionable position of waiting until 2076

239
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,135
To complete the production

240
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:43,903
Further Heights

241
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,695
Is the grave beat that these documents

242
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,975
Produced

243
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:50,559
Oh no they did not write forthwith

244
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,607
Doesn't seem like it

245
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:57,215
Listen to your position that kind of seems like something you would say if you were fully aware that the manager making isn't

246
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:57,983
Impossible

247
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:02,591
Give no expectation that it'll be mad and you're kind of just prepared to use that is proof

248
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,871
There's a cover-up going on

249
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,687
That's kind of the vibe I was getting I mean you're not

250
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:13,087
Tossing around forthwith unless you also have a familiarity with admiralty law and that's kind of what I'm

251
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:15,391
I'm driving with around here it some

252
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,927
That there's a there's like

253
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,487
Words that in college

254
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,791
I think it wasn't like I think was professor

255
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:28,191
Who was talking about like those words you should just never use outside of an iconoclast

256
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:34,591
Don't say it but I'm not going to say it out loud

257
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:38,175
I am I'm now dreading that I probably sent a bunch of time.

258
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:45,343
There's a list of list of members of this group on their website

259
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:48,159
Scanning it immediately an interesting name popped up

260
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,463
Polly Alexander isn't

261
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,767
And he was also a scientific

262
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:53,791
Advisor to Michael

263
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:57,119
Caputo Trump's assistant Secretary of the Department of Health of you

264
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:57,887
Human Services

265
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:03,775
Just being involved in the Trump Administration alone isn't damning but Alexander is influencing the covid response

266
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,799
Love it happened

267
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,079
Pretty serious

268
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,359
And it gives me some pot

269
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,151
It's about this group given the he's a member

270
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:14,015
In December 2020 political released internal emails from the Trump

271
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,295
Human Services

272
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,063
Department

273
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,111
I've some of them were pretty f***** up

274
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:21,183
Fourth of July 2020

275
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:23,999
Email Gmail to Caputo

276
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:27,327
Where you suggested that the country needed to open up Emmett quote

277
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,607
Infant kids

278
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:33,215
Teen the young people young adults middle-aged with no conditions have 02 little red

279
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,775
So we'll use them to develop herd immunity

280
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:36,799
We want them

281
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,567
I'm infected

282
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,871
In another email from that day He suggests

283
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:43,967
People spread covid to each other intentionally like having measles party

284
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:50,367
In later days figures like Secretary of HHS Alex Azar

285
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,415
Alexandra

286
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,951
But there are a number of reasons

287
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:54,719
The doubt that

288
00:14:55,487 --> 00:15:01,631
In another email this one sent to CDC director Robert Redfield stop the release of the

289
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:04,191
The morbidity and mortality weekly report

290
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:06,239
Because he felt they were being used to quote

291
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,263
President

292
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,055
He went on to demand quote

293
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:14,431
Nothing to go out unless I read and agree with the findings how they CDC Roatan

294
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,455
And I tweaked it

295
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,479
To ensure 8

296
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,271
Fair and balanced and complete

297
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,807
Oh boy

298
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:23,391
Yeah nothing goes out unless I tweaked it

299
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,439
Ellen saying is we

300
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,231
Can't print out

301
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,511
QuickBooks

302
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,279
File

303
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:32,351
Okay we are just send it to some real familiar

304
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,375
Before we could

305
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:40,031
So this doesn't stop here other released emails you can see Alexander attempting to control

306
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,871
Particularly about the possibility of children being

307
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:44,639
Infected

308
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:47,711
He was fired shortly after these emails were released which may

309
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:51,551
Every got fired he seemed to strike a bit of a combative tone

310
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:58,207
In a lengthy email to the Globe and Mail on Wednesday at a subsequent interview dr. Alexander accuse the CDC of

311
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:01,023
Generating pseudo-scientific reports

312
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:06,655
And said he was more qualified to analyze covid-19 data that lie 1700 scientist at the age

313
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:10,751
Go to none of those people have my skills dr. Alexander said

314
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,055
I make a judgment whether this is crap

315
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:16,383
It's starting to feel like delusional narcissist just kind of meat

316
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,199
Hardee's or something and then overthrow

317
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,223
Well

318
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,783
At this guy he met Michael

319
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:29,183
Caputo when Caputo was a radio host

320
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:34,303
President's Administration that's what I want my radio.

321
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:39,935
And his fingerprints are behind-the-scenes on a ton of things that don't look great in hindsight about the pandemic and it's

322
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:40,703
Response

323
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,751
And he was only an advisor to Anna

324
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,799
Assistant secretary at the HHS

325
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,591
Ateez member of this group

326
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,943
But one sketchy Apple doesn't mean that the whole group should be

327
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,991
Be seen as suspicious so I kept looking

328
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,551
Another member of the group is dr.ira

329
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,575
Bernstein

330
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,367
He's a family doctor from

331
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,903
Toronto who's pushed

332
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,207
Largely supplement and lifestyle approach

333
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:04,255
Do avoiding a reducing the danger of covid

334
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:07,327
He's kept a largely low-profile but he

335
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,655
You did fly to Rome this year to speak at the international covid Summit

336
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:13,727
Which was packed to the gills with a notable anti-vax proponent

337
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,799
Ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine pushers

338
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:21,407
Like Alex's buddy dr. zelenko and passed in Fort Worth guest PR Corey

339
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:25,759
Who was the guy who went on Rogan show along with Bret Weinstein to promote

340
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,039
Hi Roberta

341
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:31,647
You may not be as big of a name on this as people on this lineup but you knew what this event was

342
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:34,207
About me flew across the world to be a part of it

343
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,999
What about all I need to know about his

344
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:36,767
His judgment

345
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,047
Also I watch

346
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:41,887
Just Beach from Rome and in it Bernstein recommended Ivermectin and Hydrox

347
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:42,655
Chloroquine

348
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,935
Including siding both as

349
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,727
Is preventive medications people can take

350
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,495
Prophylaxis

351
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,287
Just for covid-19

352
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,823
Also co-signers

353
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,359
Is Lex Luthor

354
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,639
Joker

355
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:57,759
Whoever Aquaman fought in the guy who is a manta Black Manta was that him

356
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:01,855
That's all they're all in there some other people have some like real

357
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,623
Serious

358
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:10,047
Maybe not as over but Siri is kind of like anti-vaccine

359
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:10,815
Urologist

360
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:14,143
Another interesting character is Doctor Lionel bassoon

361
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:20,287
Who seems to be most notable for being deeply involved in injecting Wall Street Traders with testosterone to quote

362
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:23,103
Give themselves an edge over their professional rival

363
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,127
I

364
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,687
That's my dream job

365
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:33,087
Dream job $2,000 with the last name bassoon just

366
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:36,159
Scamming rich people with injections that might

367
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:42,559
F****** kill them who cares but it could also if you could also make them manly

368
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:46,143
Mine's they're all screaming nonsense at each other

369
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:52,543
Bassoon people are not above board and I do not trust it

370
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,823
Their motive at all

371
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,127
This is a group that I find sketchy

372
00:18:56,639 --> 00:19:02,527
Coupon I'ma Haven at the Goldman Sachs lunch

373
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:05,599
A bassoon recently

374
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,135
The trombone

375
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:10,207
I thought dr. trombone

376
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,999
My woodwind are a lot smaller than you

377
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:15,071
Even with all that set

378
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:19,423
It like even if I don't trust that group they're still putting out RealPlayer request

379
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,471
For real document show that's good

380
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:28,127
More information is a positive thing and the documents themselves could be assessed outside of whatever they end up using them for this

381
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:28,895
Whatever

382
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:32,223
Whatever spend there going to be dicks about it but I'm

383
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,503
I'm still happy if we get

384
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:37,599
Public document that interpretation

385
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,903
How the documents end up becoming public

386
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,927
That's more information

387
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:41,695
Hurrah

388
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:47,839
So at this point they're seven documents up on their website and two of them are text files that don't really provide any of

389
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:48,607
Information

390
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:53,983
I know from following the conspiracy world as I do that the document that's the most interest to it Alex

391
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:57,567
Talking about talking about very briefly

392
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,103
Episode do it

393
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:02,431
His top story is a document titled

394
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,223
5.3.

395
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,759
Six post-marketing

396
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:06,783
Experience.

397
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,551
PDF

398
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:10,623
This document is an analysis of the quote

399
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:13,695
Cumulative post off the reservation safety data

400
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,719
Including us

401
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:18,047
Stand for in post office relation Adverse Events reported

402
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,839
Adverse event reports

403
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,655
Received through the 28th of February 2021

404
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:28,287
But like we talked about with the various data that is consistently misuse by and Evac propagandist

405
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,871
The date of that underlies this report is also Limited in its application

406
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:35,711
The report specifically points out that this data cannot be used

407
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:38,783
Determine incidence rates of various potential Adverse Events

408
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:41,855
And is useful primarily just as a means of signal

409
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:42,879
Detection

410
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,415
Which is against a Prometheus

411
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:47,743
In addition many of the reported adverse event

412
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:48,511
What's come with

413
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,535
Incomplete Medical in

414
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,815
Formation about the patients

415
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:53,375
Making it essentially impossible to gather follow-up in

416
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,143
Information about there

417
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:54,911
Specification

418
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,959
And for these and other reason

419
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:03,103
This kind of reporting of Adverse Events is on helpful in determining if something is caused by a particular drug

420
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,663
It provides information just not that

421
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:06,687
Information

422
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:13,343
So in their dataset there were 40 2086 case reports of which 25,000 three

423
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,367
879

424
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,647
Had been medically

425
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,416
Confirmed

426
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,720
So almost 40% of them were.

427
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,256
Confirmed cases

428
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,792
Don't really know

429
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,584
It's a person actually had

430
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,608
What they're reporting

431
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,376
They had

432
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,656
It's okay

433
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,192
Get those get those at

434
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,472
Maybe maybe not

435
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,008
Yeah maybe not not for sure

436
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:35,104
Received then analyzed and evaluate

437
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,384
In terms of how much of a

438
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,432
Signal the data was coming in

439
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,200
To represent

440
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:42,016
Which would then continue to guide how the monitoring would proceed

441
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:47,648
Example they found their based on the reports anaphylaxis was an important threat they identified

442
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,696
They review the cases and found

443
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,744
The reports come again quote

444
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:54,816
Did not reveal any significant new safety information

445
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,120
Because there's already an awareness that there will be

446
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,912
Some potential allergic reaction

447
00:21:59,424 --> 00:21:59,936
The people can have

448
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:00,960
But they have to

449
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,240
Any medication

450
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:05,824
And the vast majority of the cases had resolved

451
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:10,176
Of the 2958 potentially relevant events

452
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,200
So they identified

453
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,992
There were nine fatalities

454
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:13,760
But quote

455
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:14,528
Although the

456
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:18,624
Patients experienced Adverse Events that are potential symptoms of anaphylaxis

457
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:21,440
They all had serious underlying medical condition

458
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:24,768
And one individual appears to also have covid-19 pneumonia

459
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,536
The likely

460
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,304
Contributed

461
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,328
That's right

462
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:30,912
It's it's very difficult to do you have the number of 9

463
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:34,240
Anaphylaxis dataset

464
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:35,520
And

465
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:36,288
You could look at that

466
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,056
And say well

467
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,848
People had a flag

468
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,384
Responses to the shot

469
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,152
Medical

470
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,688
What's the reality is

471
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:45,760
With the greater amount of data that they have there's no

472
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:46,784
Proof that

473
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,064
Possible

474
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,600
Anaphylactic reaction that they had

475
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,880
Contributed to whatever

476
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,928
So that's

477
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:54,720
Kind of vibe of

478
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:55,744
Proportion

479
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,792
Looking over the document

480
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:02,144
If anything I feel more confident that the folks who released the vaccine are doing due diligence

481
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,424
The terms of monitoring

482
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,960
Post-marketing safety issues

483
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:11,104
That's not Alex's take on it and I get any type of document gets released he needs

484
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,128
To find a way to make it to

485
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,152
Open gone he's been

486
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,176
Looking for all along

487
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:22,112
The other three documents that are currently available on the group's website or long list of clinical sites and the seavees of researchers

488
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:22,880
Involved

489
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:25,696
I don't think of getting nearly as much traction with folks like Alex

490
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:32,352
It's not fertile ground to misinterpret things you can just grab LinkedIn pages and put them on your website and call the doctor

491
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:38,752
Get more than the LinkedIn page man you got the whole like resumes of people

492
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,848
Email address

493
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:48,480
So I took a little longer on this one in like got into some of the stuff because I know that this document was a big deal for Alex

494
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:50,016
The time that we skipped over

495
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,808
Address

496
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,112
The group that's behind the suit

497
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,136
I get a sense

498
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:59,744
Particularly if the FDA does end up releasing 500 pages of documents a month

499
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:03,072
Then we're going to be getting new imaginary Bombshells about this for a long

500
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,864
I think this is going to be

501
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,400
Something

502
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:11,008
We'll have to deal with I mean it's going to be a very annoying

503
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:11,776
My guess

504
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:14,336
And that's only because this is

505
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,616
Just how it's almost always were

506
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:20,224
Is that if the FDA test actually start releasing 500.

507
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:20,992
If it's a butt

508
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,016
They will then

509
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,040
Feel obligated

510
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:23,808
To work

511
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,856
To get through those 500 documents

512
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:28,416
Do you mean by that

513
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,304
I don't know man I don't

514
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,072
Think that

515
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,376
Everybody like Alex

516
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,656
2 plague

517
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:40,448
By the feeling of needing to work

518
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,216
That's true

519
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:47,616
That is true I think that they've made peace with that quite a while ago

520
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,640
Stick with it

521
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:55,296
I do you read a headline and make something up what are you sticking with

522
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:59,648
That's true other people will write a headlight for you that's all

523
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,768
What an a****** there's no debate

524
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:08,608
Now because all these documents Republic there's no debate that this is

525
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,632
I kill you

526
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,424
9

527
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:17,824
99 in the anaphylaxis group little over a thousand actual fatalities

528
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,872
Deaths that are reported in this document

529
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,408
And obviously

530
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,432
Not all of them

531
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,968
Maybe

532
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:29,856
None of them can be definitively proven to have been a result of

533
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,648
The data that's available shouldn't

534
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:33,440
Be using that way anyway

535
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:38,304
And Aunt is breakdowns of like the individual things like the anaphylaxis

536
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,352
They have the instances of death

537
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,120
And

538
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:50,592
All of his other mitigating circumstances to say that you have confirmed this is the Smoking Gun yes that is going to

539
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:51,872
Alex

540
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:56,992
Okay before we get to this he says there's no debate I would say that

541
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,784
There's a little bit of debate

542
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,320
There is

543
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,600
There is no discussion

544
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,160
There's no debate

545
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:04,928
That

546
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:08,000
The government documents in their own admissions are this doesn't

547
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:08,768
Protect you

548
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,304
It erases your immune system

549
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,352
Contract

550
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,888
Need more likely to die

551
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:21,312
And it was all a premeditated plan

552
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,872
We are here in the middle

553
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,408
This

554
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:28,480
How do you operate if you think that's

555
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:29,504
True

556
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:30,784
I don't know

557
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,832
Implications of it are staggering

558
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:33,856
I mean

559
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:38,208
You have to feel completely unsafe and literally every moment of your life

560
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,256
What can you trust anyone

561
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,280
How could you go to

562
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,304
DMV

563
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,328
How could you

564
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:46,400
Just get a driver's license whatever works restore

565
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:52,800
They're killing you you think they're going to give you a non poison potato

566
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:55,616
The level of

567
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,152
. every living in his

568
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,176
Just

569
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:58,944
Impossible

570
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,736
Like if you're in that

571
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:03,808
Completely paranoid headspace how do you not start thinking like

572
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:05,344
Oh obviously

573
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:06,624
If all this is

574
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,392
True

575
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,672
Then up Alex's

576
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,464
Clearly here to pacify me

577
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,840
I'm at that paranoid skepticism

578
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:22,240
The very person who supposed to be the only person you can trust everyone is murdering me why am I still sitting here

579
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:25,568
Here listening to this a****** tell me not to do anything but give him money

580
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:27,616
And how could he be

581
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:30,176
Be here that the only voice you can trust

582
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,712
No do you get anybody

583
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:34,528
Nope there's just one person you can trust

584
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:39,648
Please eyes crazy I just got into a weird space thinking about that lie

585
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:40,928
City horrible 2

586
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:42,208
To live into think this is

587
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,256
True yeah I mean just

588
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:45,792
Is if your

589
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:52,192
If you're that influence that you're either bored or you're just trap so Alex has a little bit of news about close to us

590
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,496
And I'm going to need a citation

591
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,480
We're going to blame

592
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,296
On the existing Institution

593
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:10,624
Then they'll order those institutions they control

594
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,416
Publix

595
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,720
The public will destroy those institutions

596
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:17,280
And now the global is coming in to a failed state

597
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,304
Control

598
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,168
That is the plan

599
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,448
So doody under

600
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,752
I have no idea where you stay

601
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:27,776
Sing this from

602
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:29,056
But

603
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,848
Do you understand the plan

604
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,384
So the plan is

605
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,432
Call Schwab is like hey guys

606
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,456
Is totally cap

607
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:38,784
Asphalt and everybody's like hey man we got to take down Kappa

608
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:40,832
Them so everybody takes down capitalism

609
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,368
And then the globos are like

610
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,136
Surprised

611
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:45,440
Is capitalism that was keeping globalism

612
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,720
From killing all of you

613
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,768
Even though capitalism was also killing you

614
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,048
Now we're just going to do about it

615
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,072
Maybe

616
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,096
I think

617
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:56,448
That seems like what I was understand

618
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:58,752
Okay what are you

619
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:01,056
Is up here like a bond villain

620
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,128
Temperature

621
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:07,456
He's saying hahaha great reset

622
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:12,320
Right to destroys everything and then he tries to pin the blame on capitalism

623
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,088
But

624
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,624
This only prompts like

625
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,416
Like the Patriots a people like Alex

626
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,184
Forget the street

627
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:20,256
And start to start a shooting or something

628
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,792
The forces of the

629
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,584
Estate Rider sent out

630
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,168
To attack them or whatever they have a little bit of a battle

631
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,264
End up winning but in the process at the failed state

632
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:33,312
Savannah

633
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:35,872
Can come in and be like we own it

634
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:36,640
You know it's

635
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:37,408
Real fun

636
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:40,224
I think was the most fun part of being a patriot hat

637
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,528
To be the part where you assume you would win in a fight against

638
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,296
The state

639
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:45,088
Like as a leftist

640
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:48,160
Not once do I assume that I'm going to win in a fight

641
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:54,560
Get the state I assume the states going to murder me twice over if I come if I look at the state the wrong way they're coming for him yourself

642
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:56,352
Michael Ian Black

643
00:29:56,608 --> 00:30:01,472
The whole thing the Showalter

644
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:10,176
Is it is it is an interesting aspect of their ideology so much of the

645
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,456
Literature that

646
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,296
It's a lot of the stuff

647
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:17,344
Disorder grow up on this

648
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,624
This fantasy ideology

649
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,184
Well the only reason we're not

650
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,768
In charge us cuz we're too nice

651
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:31,168
Back and allow you to oppress your all day

652
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:33,472
Everyone of you yeah it is

653
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,776
Little bit of hubris

654
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:36,800
Just a little

655
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,848
So look

656
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,128
You can save your own life

657
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:42,432
Okay to do

658
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,456
Are you ready

659
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,992
Not ready to do it

660
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:53,184
If you put out today that's on Bandit video

661
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:58,816
Because of the time we live in just like my broadcast or more Powerball

662
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:06,496
I don't like your FairPoint

663
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,264
It's only

664
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,568
4 minutes 50 seconds long

665
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,616
I suggest

666
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:12,384
Six Flags

667
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,944
Collapse civilization

668
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,968
But you do get that

669
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:18,784
Share it like your life depends on it cuz let me give you a little news flash

670
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:23,648
Your life depends on sharing a johnbowne video

671
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,416
My life

672
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,952
Depends on that

673
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:29,536
There's a lot of people who

674
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:34,656
Didn't even know who John Powell is there screwed

675
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:40,800
This is a little bit like whenever the Europeans brought Christianity over to the to the new world you know it's like

676
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,080
If you don't know about.

677
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:45,664
Jesus you can't be guilty of his original sin right

678
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,712
If I don't know about John bowne I can't

679
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:49,248
Be killed for not sharing with four minutes

680
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:55,904
I regret to inform you this situation

681
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,952
Responsibility to know about John Bonham

682
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:02,560
In the beginning was the Bell

683
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:11,776
Yeah so I'm going to dispute whether or not Alex's broadcaster more powerful now

684
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:17,408
He ended his show with a half-hour infomercial for his phone

685
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,712
Don't know this is hard head

686
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,480
Thanks.

687
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:22,272
One of the big things

688
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:26,368
That happened in time in between

689
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,392
Sabbatical in the past

690
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,696
Was there Tucker Carlson

691
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:31,232
Then came out and had some words

692
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:33,792
But Alex

693
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:35,840
I want

694
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:38,656
I want to talk about a little bit of there cuz Alex plays the clip

695
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:40,192
On his is she out

696
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:44,800
AC3 wanted to do everything except his job he plays a lot of

697
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:49,408
Sunday

698
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:54,272
The balance Dasher

699
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:00,928
Here is the first piece of this clip

700
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,464
Tucker

701
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,232
I got to say

702
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,512
This is

703
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:05,792
Amazing

704
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:08,096
Like there's no way

705
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:09,120
He's this stoop

706
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:12,192
Whatever else is done with the body

707
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,216
This is not a fight

708
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:15,776
Is it highly

709
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:16,544
Obviously

710
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:17,568
Punished

711
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:21,408
He's talking about the January 6th

712
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,016
Using a pretext

713
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,040
Something reset

714
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,368
Advisor Steve

715
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:31,904
What

716
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,928
What was the score

717
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:36,512
Fraud on a radio show that's illegal now

718
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,072
There's legitimately no way he's

719
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,352
Stupid that sucks

720
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,632
So intentional

721
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:42,912
Is f****** unreal

722
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,032
To imagine

723
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,056
Inform

724
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:51,104
People hearing that and being like Oh that's

725
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,128
What you're reporting

726
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,408
What's Wild

727
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:57,504
He knows damn well the band and got indicted for refusing to comply with a subpoena

728
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:01,600
Tucker also knows that the subpoena wasn't just issued cuz Bannon talk about election

729
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:02,880
She brought on his radio show

730
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:07,744
The subpoena letter is publicly available and has been for months and it's super clear why the committee wanted

731
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,512
Let's talk to him

732
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,792
Turn the letter quote

733
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:16,448
He has reason to believe that you have information relevant to understanding important activities that led to and informed the

734
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,472
Events at the Capitol

735
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:18,240
On January

736
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,520
2021

737
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:25,152
For example you have been identified as present at the Willard Hotel on January 5th 2021

738
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:27,200
During an effort to persuade members

739
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:30,016
The Congress to block the certification of the election the next day

740
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,040
And in relation

741
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,832
The other activities on January 6th

742
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,696
It's true that the letter does also mention how band and made some comments that seem a bit pricey

743
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:40,768
Episode of this podcast that was released on January 5th

744
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:42,816
All the episode he said quote

745
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:45,120
All hell is going to break loose tomorrow

746
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:48,448
Just understand this all hell is going to break loose tomorrow

747
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,728
It's going to be moving

748
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:51,520
It's going to be going it's going to be

749
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:55,616
Be quick so many people said man if I was in a revolution I would be in washing

750
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:58,176
Well this is your time in history

751
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:01,504
It's all converging and now we're at the point-of-attack tomorrow

752
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:05,600
And all I can say is strap-in you've made this happening tomorrow it's

753
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,368
Game day

754
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:10,720
Man you know I really don't think he knew it Advanced that it would go as s*** is

755
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:17,120
Is it did and he was just using bombastic language

756
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,144
Right

757
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:23,008
That's the wrong day to do it he's got he had to have seen should happen on the 6th and just go

758
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:27,616
Remember we said an approximate

759
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:34,016
Bulshit actor pretending to not even know the basic details of the stories he's talked about is

760
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:36,064
Way less convincing than Alex's

761
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:38,368
Like Alex seems legitimate Leon aware of

762
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,136
Most

763
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,160
Library details

764
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,440
What story he's covering you just

765
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:43,232
Inno skins a headliner whatever

766
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:46,304
Tucker is feigning ignorance to allow himself to making

767
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,376
Incredibly stupid arguments will be impossible to make otherwise

768
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,448
It's more embarrassing

769
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:54,496
The bow tie

770
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,520
It's like

771
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:04,480
Through too much propaganda if it's what the entire world is lived through so much propaganda that you should have to at least try harder than

772
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:07,552
Let's let's take just like the really Bass

773
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:08,576
Part of that

774
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:09,600
Right

775
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:11,904
So he's saying he's asserting

776
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,952
Outrageous

777
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,488
That the committee

778
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:17,024
Would wanna arrest

779
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,072
Steve Bannon just for talking on a radio

780
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:20,096
I would be out

781
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,888
Now if you're a listener

782
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:24,192
Of stalkers stuff reviewer

783
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,496
Is that true I can't believe that that's

784
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,264
Terrifying

785
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,544
And you went ahead and looked

786
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,848
Get up you could very easily find the letter

787
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:33,920
Empty but no that's not the reason that they want to talk to him

788
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,968
That's not an accurate portrayal

789
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:37,248
Of what happened

790
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:39,296
And then you'd have to ask yourself.

791
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,064
Team

792
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,880
This is on Fox News there's no way that this

793
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,160
Accidentally slip

794
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,952
No choice

795
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:46,720
Yep

796
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,512
Especially considering that

797
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,048
If you've been watching

798
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:52,352
Tucker show you know exactly why

799
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,632
He got

800
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:54,912
A subpoena

801
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:59,520
Like he's going through all of the reasons that you would subpoena somebody like Steve Bannon

802
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,312
For the January 6th

803
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:03,104
By his defensive

804
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,128
Steve Bannon

805
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:06,944
He is revealing all of the reasons

806
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:07,968
He also defends

807
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:08,736
Rodger

808
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:15,648
Big a big Rodger Stone it's okay to publicly defend him

809
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:18,208
Well I mean unless you're defending his

810
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:21,280
They even subpoenaed Rodger Stone

811
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,304
Yet again

812
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,888
He was in a hotel room

813
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,168
Capital is being

814
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,192
Literally

815
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:29,728
Nothing to do with it

816
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:30,752
What does it matter

817
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:33,568
Going to jail again

818
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,104
So

819
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:37,920
Start arguing from a false premise

820
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:42,528
You pretending that the January 6th committee wants to speak to Rodger to get information about his

821
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:44,576
Direct involvement with breaking into the cabin

822
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:47,392
Tucker's doing that so we can brush it away with it

823
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:49,696
Deflection like Rodger wasn't even at the Capitol

824
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:50,720
How many can move on

825
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:57,632
This is important to do because if you were required to face reality of what the committee subpoenaed Rodger about it would take a while for

826
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:00,704
For him to explain it Rodger will come out looking not-so-innocent

827
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:04,032
Spoiler alert they want to talk to him by about his involvement in

828
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:09,152
Stop the steel in multiple members of The Oath Keepers that he paid for his personal security guard

829
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:11,200
Reportedly involved in breaking into the Kappa

830
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:16,064
Tucker brother not on pack that and I understand why I wouldn't want to do that either if I were him

831
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:18,880
Too messy I don't like

832
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:19,648
I mean

833
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,184
Defending Rodger

834
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,720
Rodger went away in the

835
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:23,488
The public

836
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:26,048
For a good while as far as somebody that you could

837
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,072
Even on the right

838
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:27,840
Defend Papa

839
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,120
You know they were like

840
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:32,448
Rogers a great guy but then they would just let it go you know they would

841
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:37,312
Just leave that on the sun I think the pardon pushed things a little too much

842
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:40,128
Yeah he's now coming back up

843
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:40,896
But somebody was like

844
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,944
Why is everybody picking on Rodger Stone

845
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:48,576
You shouldn't even be allowed to say Rogers name without like I was wrong

846
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:50,624
List of crimes popping up next

847
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,160
Do your name scrolling down like

848
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:58,560
Accredits decades-long Manos Rogers that should be his epithet title

849
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,120
So now we get to the alley

850
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:01,888
Alexis Park

851
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,424
In the Tucker commentary

852
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:07,264
Now the committee's

853
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:10,080
Journalist on the right Alex Jones

854
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:15,200
Truth is he in Spanish

855
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,784
In recent years other words

856
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:22,880
Nbcnews National Security course

857
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:23,904
Kendall

858
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,184
Margaret

859
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:28,768
The Russia House

860
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:33,120
She he would ask him

861
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:33,888
Real question

862
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:42,592
January 6th

863
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:44,128
I don't really

864
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:47,200
Interesting way for Tucker to discuss Alex's journalist

865
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,224
Merit

866
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,760
Take this piece by piece

867
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:54,112
Go for it. The first claim that he's making is that Alex is often criticized for his flamboyant

868
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:54,880
Oh yeah

869
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:55,648
That's not

870
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:59,232
It's the only thing that we positively affirm him towards

871
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:02,048
The problem with Alex was just a matter of flamboyant

872
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:02,816
The podcast

873
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:03,584
Exist

874
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:05,632
Like David Bowie or Prince or Elton

875
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,704
Little flamboyant

876
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,240
Stop playing

877
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,008
It's insanity

878
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,824
The things that Tucker is passing off as flamboyant

879
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:17,664
Things like Alex fake crying on are thinking about all the abortion

880
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,944
Transitive happened in the country

881
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,992
Things like Alex discussing in Greek

882
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:23,552
Detail how he stomped multiple peoples guts in

883
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:26,624
And when they do that it takes a person a long time to die

884
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,160
This is flamboyant

885
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:33,024
People do people think on it for that man also a larger problem that people have with Alex

886
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,096
Spend that I guess you could call it maybe Showmanship

887
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:40,192
Is the fact that he's constantly wrong about things and use makes up s*** all the time

888
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:45,824
He basically just skim headlines than improvises what he imagines the story is about and how it connects to his larger

889
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,592
Conspiracies

890
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:48,896
It is much bigger problem than any kind of

891
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:50,176
Imagine flamboyant

892
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:56,576
Okay so maybe we call him a journalist maybe we call him a guy to maybe we blur the line between the two so

893
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,600
You don't have to worry about that

894
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:58,880
Fancy truth that you

895
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,928
Keep talking about Dan

896
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,792
The next point is interesting as a Tucker seems to think that the fact that Alex was super combative again

897
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:08,096
Against the idea that Trump's campaign and Russia had any

898
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:10,400
Is the primary variable that makes

899
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,680
Emigrate journalist

900
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:12,960
Guide to reality

901
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:19,872
I feel like there's a larger picture than that one story in two that Alex was super wrong about Trump and Russia

902
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:20,896
Constantly

903
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:26,272
Give right though that the hyperbolic claim that Trump was Nathan to brush it wasn't correct and I guess

904
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:28,320
Alex knowing that makes him an offer

905
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:33,440
Some journalist

906
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:36,000
East Coast. Maybe

907
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:41,120
Well I guess so I guess Tucker will report on that next to

908
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:47,520
The other thing that qualifies Alex as a real good journalist is the Tucker thinks that if he sat down with fauci

909
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:48,288
Instead of being a sicko

910
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:52,384
How's the terrible news for talking about what would happen if Alex interview fauci

911
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:54,687
It would begin and end with Alex

912
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:56,735
Accusing pouch of crimes against humanity

913
00:41:56,991 --> 00:42:00,063
You probably try to put pasta under citizen's arrest at some point

914
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:02,879
I'm sure the devil would come up and is supposed to ask

915
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:04,671
Questions

916
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:06,975
The conspiracy means he remembers at fauci

917
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:08,511
And trying plug is website

918
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:11,071
Are you would also make fun of fauci using County

919
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:13,887
His voice yeah probably do an impression

920
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:20,287
For sure are you accuse him of his last name meaning the sickle

921
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:26,687
At least a few times

922
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:31,039
BBC to know that Alex will treat this less like an opportunity to ask real questions

923
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,063
Morgan opportunity

924
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:32,831
Ready to do a publisher

925
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,111
That's what he does

926
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:34,879
And

927
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:37,951
He would treat fauci so obsequious Lee while not on a

928
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:42,047
Probably I can't believe that you came on my shows

929
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:44,607
Great I can't talk all the time anyway

930
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:57,663
Philip theaters Manuel just Philip theater in your famous and I'm not at all sycophantic

931
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:59,199
Finally Tucker search

932
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:01,503
That the committee is threatening Alex of prison

933
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:03,039
Because he makes fun of Joe Biden

934
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:06,367
That's dumb and it's not true but really what all the screams

935
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:10,719
To me is that Tucker doesn't watch Alex's actual work and it's kind of banking on the hope that

936
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:12,511
Not many people in his audience to either

937
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,815
What he saying is laughable to me because

938
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:16,095
I know what Alex's show is

939
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:18,399
Like how we interact with information Howie's

940
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:19,423
Flamboyant

941
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,191
2 *

942
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:25,055
But if you know like it's all you know about Alex's the little glimpses you get from time to time a Grogan

943
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,615
Podcast you might get tricked by this kind of bulshit but

944
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:28,895
Anybody who knows

945
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:31,199
And listen to his show at like

946
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:32,479
Yeah. Just a little quick

947
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:34,015
Or whatever you know

948
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:38,623
This is not accurate

949
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:39,903
Christy is not

950
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:40,927
Is not flamboyant

951
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:42,719
So Alex

952
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:44,767
We get back to him

953
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:47,327
And there's some news out of Luxembourg

954
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,119
That there is a people who are having

955
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:51,679
A bit of a protest against covid restrictions

956
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:52,703
Transmasc rules

957
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:56,799
This is one thing that bothers me about the far right now

958
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:57,567
News media

959
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:59,103
I don't care

960
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,895
If anybody in Luxembourg

961
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:01,919
Is doing f******

962
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:02,943
Wow

963
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:04,223
Let's party

964
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:11,391
True I don't agree with you

965
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:16,511
I don't I don't agree with you I think people around the world that are all their concerns are all valid

966
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:20,095
Alex doesn't really know what looks

967
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:27,007
Showing you footage of Luxembourg Germany were thousands of people

968
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:37,247
Reality

969
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:44,927
Easy mistake to make tiny country and maybe Alex just misspoke or whatever

970
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:49,279
Interesting Lee though Luxembourg was occupied by Germany in both world wars

971
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:51,839
So it's entirely possible that Alex just thinks

972
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:53,375
To the country still part of the Reich

973
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:58,751
Sure like he's called Zimbabwe or Rhodesia a number of times I thought it possible that he actually just fix

974
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:00,799
But not the

975
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:06,943
Third Reich is still alive and action is still in the Soviet Union

976
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:08,991
I swear to God

977
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:10,527
He says Czechoslovakia still

978
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:11,807
Probably

979
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:13,599
So Alex has

980
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,647
Using source to get to

981
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:18,975
There is a guy who's an Archbishop

982
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:20,255
Things come up on the show

983
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:23,327
For Santa he's got a new letter that he's written

984
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,863
I don't do interviews X

985
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:26,911
Hoobly

986
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:34,591
The live show feed

987
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:41,759
Those who resist the New World Order will have the help

988
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:43,551
And protection of God

989
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:44,831
Italian art

990
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:45,599
Bishop

991
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:46,879
Bogano chests

992
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:50,719
Charge density

993
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:54,047
And Christ said

994
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:56,095
A tree by its fruit

995
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:59,167
Is there a Jeffrey by its 2

996
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:05,823
This dude's a retired Archbishop has decided to create a late-life career in sending letters out to talk s***

997
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:11,199
He's written a few that I want to talk about the past and we've discussed them when he has and now I guess he's back on his b*******

998
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:15,039
This new letter starts off sounding like it's an appeal to all

999
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:19,647
People in the world to band together to fight off the New World Order and Evil covid

1000
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:27,071
Global coup d'etat deprived citizens of any possibility of Defense since the legislative executive and judicial power

1001
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:29,631
Are complicit in the violation of law just

1002
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:31,167
The purpose for which they exist

1003
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:34,495
It's a global coup d'etat because this criminal attack

1004
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:36,287
Again citizens extends to the whole world

1005
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,567
With very rare except

1006
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:40,639
It's a World War where the enemies are all of

1007
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:43,455
Even those who unwittingly have not yet understood this

1008
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:44,479
What does happen

1009
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:47,551
At least that sounds unifying

1010
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,855
Shrug

1011
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:50,879
It's based on dump

1012
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:52,159
Conspiracy theories but at least

1013
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:55,999
There's a hope of humanity banding together to fight off a common enemy

1014
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:57,535
Because everyone's under threat

1015
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:04,959
This is kind of a little bit of Independence Day

1016
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:08,287
A worldwide anti-global unfortunately

1017
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:09,823
Did you read it

1018
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,871
It's really just Christian nationalism

1019
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:18,527
I invite all those who want to defend traditional Christian Society to meet together an international Forum to be held

1020
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:19,295
Soon as possible

1021
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:25,183
I called the Christian nations together from east2west inviting heads of states and the healthy forces event

1022
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:28,255
Institutions the economy labor universities Healthcare

1023
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,023
Information

1024
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,583
To join a common project disrupting the old system

1025
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:36,703
And putting aside the hostilities that are desired by the enemies of humanity in the name of divide and conquer

1026
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:37,983
How great

1027
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:40,031
He's trying to overcome the evil people who are divided

1028
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:45,663
Screwing everybody by dividing the world into Christian or non-Christian country

1029
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:47,711
Elisa cats in plaid

1030
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:50,783
This honestly seems less like an attempted fighting something

1031
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:53,599
Is it sounds like a new version of the Crusades

1032
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:56,159
I call upon Nations and their

1033
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,695
Ally themselves under the

1034
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:59,231
The cross of our Lord Jesus Christ

1035
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:01,535
The only King and Saviour the Prince of Peace

1036
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:07,423
In this science that we shall conquer

1037
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:13,055
We must gather our troops together and take them down the merry Road

1038
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:15,359
In the name of our Lord.

1039
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:18,943
It does seem like Crusade

1040
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:27,135
That's the way of Our Lord Neighbors

1041
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:29,695
Sorry

1042
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:32,767
I got I got carried away by the spirit of the Crusades

1043
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:35,327
Post on life site

1044
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:39,679
He cites inaccurate quotes about the new world order that are actually identical to the one

1045
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:40,959
Songs that are sighted in endgame

1046
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:41,983
And even post

1047
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:44,031
Points to the lockstep document

1048
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:46,847
Some kind of proof of premeditation on the part of the Rockefellers

1049
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:52,223
I was really impressed with the information coming out of this dude last time we talked about him and it turns out that his not change

1050
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:55,807
Dick's always write letters for

1051
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,599
Austerity is if anybody in the

1052
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:03,743
You know what I kind of enjoy it it's old-timey

1053
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:10,143
Yeah I just didn't they all start out like they're writing the Declaration of Independence series about the New World Order

1054
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:14,239
Pen to paper everybody considered a piece

1055
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:18,079
I use the cloud

1056
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:19,615
This is Rick

1057
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:23,711
Do you even have anywhere

1058
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:25,759
So Alex

1059
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:27,807
Like you how he's going to

1060
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:29,343
He's got to get to the news

1061
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:32,927
He hasn't yet maybe not maybe not quite yet

1062
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:41,119
And then I'm going to cover

1063
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:46,239
That are

1064
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:48,543
Government documents admissions

1065
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:50,591
Vaccine

1066
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:52,383
The race is your immune system

1067
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:54,431
Heart attack

1068
00:49:57,503 --> 00:50:00,575
Another Tucker car pees

1069
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:02,367
I found this disappointing

1070
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:05,183
I found this was yet another

1071
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:05,951
Expensive Alex

1072
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:06,975
Not getting to the point

1073
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:09,279
But there is another point

1074
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:10,303
He wants to get you before

1075
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,071
Gets the point

1076
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,095
And that is

1077
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:13,119
The people

1078
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:15,679
Excited

1079
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:19,263
But he's going to declare war on Trump sure if Trump doesn't

1080
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:24,895
Get on the right side of vaccines stuff puts all his power behind

1081
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:30,527
Getting rid of vaccine Alex is going to declare war on him

1082
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:32,063
He talked about that a little bit here

1083
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:34,623
From Tucker on this

1084
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:36,671
Jose

1085
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:38,207
Almost there he's based

1086
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:44,863
Asiago

1087
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:46,399
I need to get

1088
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:51,007
Video

1089
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:59,455
How much are the VR go is vigano that's

1090
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:04,063
We at fellows advisor

1091
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:11,231
I'm going to go tomorrow

1092
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:16,351
Keep staff

1093
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,519
Then he's heading into bedding and

1094
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:26,847
I just I'm fascinated by

1095
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:28,639
How much

1096
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:30,687
This is been like a I'm leaving

1097
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:35,039
You can't stop me I'm leave I just

1098
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:37,087
So disgusting

1099
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:40,927
So just to give you a hundred more chances or man

1100
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:47,583
16 or 17 more times you do the exact opposite of what I tell people you're doing and I'm going to be mad

1101
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:51,935
This is difficult for me to string along

1102
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:55,007
Good one more chance Trump you one more chance

1103
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:57,311
Today we're going to get to the news

1104
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,847
Or maybe maybe

1105
00:51:59,359 --> 00:51:59,871
Okay baby.

1106
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:01,919
The gentleman

1107
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:06,015
I mean I'll just be honest with you

1108
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:08,831
Andre research all the stuff

1109
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:12,671
I got a problem with this is all

1110
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:17,279
We have articles coming up next

1111
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:20,095
The government

1112
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:22,399
And the corporations know they're telling us that it's on

1113
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:25,727
And I know that's the message of the show but

1114
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:31,871
Okay I'm here it's not even debated it's like

1115
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:35,199
Shopping mall scene in front of the world app

1116
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:38,783
O.j. Simpson really kill his wife

1117
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:40,831
And Ron Goldman

1118
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,415
Police in a white Bronco

1119
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:51,327
Are the shirt I'm wearing navy blue

1120
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:54,143
And the watch I'm wearing it has got a

1121
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:56,191
Army green strap-on

1122
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,263
Debatable

1123
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:00,543
Petitions going on

1124
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:04,895
Magically overwhelmed by the gravity of the news

1125
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:08,735
Just immediately at the point where he's committed to buckle up and get to the information

1126
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:13,343
Got to get to this going to get down going to do it that always happen

1127
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,623
But it's time to get serious

1128
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:15,647
Specifics

1129
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:17,951
Too much to handle

1130
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:18,975
Sirius everything is

1131
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:25,375
This is like a kid to do his homework kind of s*** to the office at around 8:39 you spell

1132
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:31,775
Send your little time dickin around and then you're about to get right to work and you're like I need a cup of coffee before I can really

1133
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:35,359
Tackle what's going on here so I'm just going to step away

1134
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:37,663
To also as it relates to Alex

1135
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:38,687
The chirping blue

1136
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:43,551
I'm sure that Alex's new hypnotist friend Jake Ducey would be really disappointed to hear that Alex

1137
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:44,319
Think that's a certainty

1138
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:45,855
I bet it's not debatable

1139
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:51,743
Debatable not only the color of the strap on Alex's watch but what did I watch even exist at all

1140
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:54,559
On a subatomic level that watch it is not solid

1141
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:57,375
And your mind can change not only what color it is

1142
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,911
But what it is to begin with

1143
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:00,191
Is your bank account isn't

1144
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:03,007
Observer effect

1145
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:07,871
How's it going towards here

1146
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:09,919
You're using their own words

1147
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:10,943
Against

1148
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:17,855
I'm starting just to build up a little bit of a theory that I'm working on fixing

1149
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:21,951
The case that might explain why it's

1150
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:27,071
Completely counter to literally the entire world do the DS Bowser

1151
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:28,863
Excuse to disappear off of quick

1152
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:29,887
Certainly

1153
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:31,423
Certainly does

1154
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:32,703
So

1155
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:34,495
Except we're not

1156
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:36,543
Because I looks like it's

1157
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,335
Uncomfortable to talk about the news

1158
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:40,383
But something else is way more comfortable

1159
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:45,503
And that's just yelling about how people want to kill you

1160
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:53,695
Years for years five-year tenure 20 years 1,000 years this is never going to end till we're all dead

1161
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:00,607
Vaccinated

1162
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:04,191
On all the lights

1163
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:06,751
Didn't take the shot

1164
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:08,287
They're the villain

1165
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:20,319
Doesn't matter it's not a vaccine

1166
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:27,231
There were last year from the shots

1167
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:30,559
These people have signed on to kill a

1168
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:35,423
Because that's the response of these globalist

1169
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:45,407
The hospitals are all full of dead and dying from omnicron that's all made up it's from the vaccine

1170
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:51,807
Omnicron omnicron first author

1171
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:53,087
I kind of like

1172
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:59,231
The omnicron though

1173
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:00,511
Who knows what that can do

1174
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:01,791
Yeah

1175
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,863
There's that there's a certain point when I'm listening to this

1176
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:07,423
These shows specially in the present-day it's

1177
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:08,191
Just like

1178
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:09,215
This is feeling

1179
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:13,311
Sometime you have so much news you claim you need to go over

1180
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:14,079
Going to get through this

1181
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:20,479
5 stacks

1182
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:22,783
Macron macaron

1183
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:24,063
Everett

1184
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:26,367
I was like they don't

1185
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:27,647
Women

1186
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:29,951
Are from Omicron Persei 7

1187
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:32,255
Where is Mater from Omicron Persei

1188
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:34,559
So

1189
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:38,655
Alex get back to talking about the situation in Germany

1190
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:41,215
But he's also talking about Luxembourg

1191
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:42,239
So I think he does that

1192
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:44,031
Think that Luxembourg isn't it

1193
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:45,823
That show the footage we shot earlier

1194
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:46,847
TV doors

1195
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,383
In Germany

1196
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:53,759
To the Christmas

1197
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:56,831
Unbelievable

1198
00:56:57,087 --> 00:57:02,719
That's the same story about Luxembourg definitely think that's in Germany it was not a slip of the tongue

1199
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:05,535
Really sad

1200
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:07,327
Great City

1201
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:13,983
The reason that Alex is doing that whether it's probably because he doesn't

1202
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:14,751
No

1203
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:15,519
The difference

1204
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:16,799
But also

1205
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:22,175
The whole thing about the Australians being like under a tyranny in Australia

1206
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:24,223
There was a German politician

1207
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:25,503
Who spoke out

1208
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:28,575
Pam was like we have solidarity with the people in Australia

1209
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:33,695
And so like apparently like a Germany is also under complete

1210
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:34,463
Police state

1211
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:35,999
According to Alex

1212
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:38,559
Did anything that's kind of close to Germany

1213
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:44,959
I guess you just going to say is a part of Germany

1214
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:47,263
As opposed to having to be like all I'll also

1215
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,055
Is a small country called Lux

1216
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:51,615
That would be too much to introduce to his audience

1217
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:52,383
It's this late in the game

1218
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:53,407
You can't

1219
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:54,687
You can't just suddenly invented

1220
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:55,967
New countries for the B

1221
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:58,783
Start a new country

1222
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:01,343
Alex gets to the story's final

1223
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:04,671
This time I'm not joking he actually.

1224
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:06,719
German data analyst

1225
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:12,351
What are the vaccinations

1226
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:19,007
I was worried that this was that Alexa

1227
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:26,943
So this was a paper that was initially released in mid-november and then immediately picked up by Alex's buddy

1228
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:28,223
Steve Kerr shoe post

1229
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:30,271
Substack and that it went around it

1230
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:31,295
Conspiracy circles from the

1231
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:34,623
Upon the release of this paper which made the claims that Alex

1232
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:35,391
Does repeating

1233
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:40,255
Tons of researchers started examining the data and found that the methodology that was used to reach the

1234
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:41,535
Conclusions was useless

1235
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:42,815
With one statistics

1236
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:45,375
Professor calling at the equivalent to proven the correlation

1237
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:46,143
Between store

1238
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:46,911
Works and births

1239
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:51,007
That's why I was a good line that is a pretty solid burn

1240
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:52,031
That's the science bird

1241
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:57,919
Received all this backlash

1242
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:58,943
Essentially admitting

1243
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:01,503
That this was supposed to be a private note that was

1244
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:04,063
Commissioned by an anti-vax politician in Germany

1245
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:06,111
Bergner

1246
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:09,439
I was it was meant to be used at a parliamentary session on covid policy

1247
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:10,975
Facebook

1248
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:11,999
Wow

1249
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:13,535
From the retraction

1250
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:14,303
Quote

1251
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:19,423
The reported and surprising correlation was intended to spark further discussions in analysis

1252
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:23,007
We regret that this note was been so widely distributed

1253
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:23,775
Wow

1254
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:25,567
They went on to say quote

1255
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:27,103
For clarification the notice

1256
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:32,479
Is neither scientific publication Nora sound scientific study which means our own standards for quality

1257
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:38,111
Are note does not prove in any way that a higher vaccination rate leads to higher mortality

1258
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:42,463
We do not want this study to be falsely interpreted as such this way

1259
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:46,047
They also asked that wherever people think this study they also mentioned this

1260
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:48,095
Retraction with you'll note Alex's not

1261
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:49,119
I

1262
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:50,399
I am amazed

1263
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:51,935
That

1264
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:52,959
You can do that

1265
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:55,007
Without also having

1266
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:56,031
Look

1267
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:58,591
We take money to tell politician

1268
00:59:58,847 --> 00:59:59,615
Bulshit that they

1269
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:01,663
Want to hear you get it that's what we do

1270
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:02,687
We took money

1271
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:03,967
To tell this guy

1272
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:06,271
Bulshit that he wanted to hear

1273
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:08,831
Apologies so they could

1274
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:09,855
Salad

1275
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:11,391
I'm trying to run the world

1276
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:13,439
Morally

1277
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:15,743
That's what we are

1278
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:19,327
Fundamentally because we took money that would give life

1279
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:24,191
I understand why you'd want a more thorough accounting possibly of the ex but

1280
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:25,983
I think I think they may have suffered some

1281
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:29,055
Like professional consequences as well

1282
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:31,359
I'm not I'm not entirely sure but that were tracks

1283
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:32,895
Speaks volumes

1284
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:33,919
And Alex

1285
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:35,455
It would be available to him

1286
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:37,503
I am at the point of doing this episode

1287
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:39,295
He does not know anything

1288
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:40,831
So here's the Second Story

1289
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:43,391
Same thing in the UK

1290
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,463
Under 60 or die

1291
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:47,999
Twice

1292
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:49,535
The same age

1293
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:53,887
Statistics for

1294
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:57,215
Fauci says

1295
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:01,055
Good good stuff

1296
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:02,079
Good coverage

1297
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:03,103
Cover

1298
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:04,383
That's

1299
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:10,783
That's the way you informational fauci said

1300
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:11,807
Kill the kids what

1301
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:12,831
Speartip

1302
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:14,367
What atmosphere

1303
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:16,415
We're always being killed by somebody

1304
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:17,951
So I'm surprisingly this also is

1305
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:18,719
Untrue

1306
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:24,095
It's a claim that was making the rounds tracing back to anti-vax substack enthusiasts Alex Barron

1307
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:31,007
Basically what happened here's the Berenson took some actual death statistics from the UK but then represented them

1308
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:31,775
Out of context

1309
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:32,543
Text entirely

1310
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:34,079
Essentially he was take

1311
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:35,871
Date of the reflected the entire population

1312
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:41,503
Asian people age 10 to 15 not considering any of the other variables that might make differences

1313
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:42,271
Among

1314
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:44,575
Differences among smaller age bracket

1315
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:45,343
Kitson groups

1316
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:47,391
Within that larger set that are big

1317
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:48,415
Taking into consideration

1318
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:49,695
Bear bear

1319
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:51,231
Very clear footnotes on the

1320
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:52,767
Statistics report that he is using

1321
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:58,911
Age standardised mortality rates can be affected by different characteristics of the population

1322
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:00,447
Can in the vaccine status group

1323
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:03,007
Andy changing covid-19 infection rate

1324
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:05,055
Therefore the ASMR

1325
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:06,847
Do not show causal links

1326
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:07,871
Between vaccine

1327
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:09,151
And risk of mortality

1328
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:13,503
Forgot to parse the data and use it how it's supposed

1329
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:14,271
To be used

1330
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:17,087
Different kinds of data are good for different

1331
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:18,367
Thanks and this report

1332
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:21,183
Even stress has some of the limitations that people making the APA

1333
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:22,463
Argument from Berenson

1334
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:23,999
Might want to use it to say

1335
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:27,071
Quote while the asmrs provide evidence

1336
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:29,375
What's that vaccinated individuals have a lower risk

1337
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:30,143
Of dying

1338
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:32,703
From coronavirus visuals

1339
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:35,263
They cannot be used to determine vaccine effective

1340
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:38,079
This is because the populations in each vex

1341
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:40,895
Status gruppe are likely to differ in ways other

1342
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:45,247
Then the population size and age because of the selected rollout of vaccine program

1343
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:46,783
It differences in vaccine update

1344
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:50,623
Basically this just another flashy anti-vax headlines based on a

1345
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:51,903
Complete misuse of data

1346
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:54,975
I wasn't looked into any of these stories at all

1347
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:55,743
He's just

1348
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:57,791
Dispassionately reading headline

1349
01:02:58,047 --> 01:03:01,375
I've no idea how could possibly be overwhelmed

1350
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:03,679
Yeah this is this is not good

1351
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:04,447
It's not good

1352
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:07,007
I want a little bit more I feel like

1353
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:08,031
Deflated

1354
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:14,431
There's there's a little deflation there's a little deflation he's really avoiding saying anything other than playing Tucker

1355
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:15,711
You're saying nice things about him

1356
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:16,735
Sure

1357
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:17,503
John bowne

1358
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:23,903
Most important report our most important

1359
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:25,695
Kubota Greg Reese reports

1360
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:26,975
The people that don't

1361
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:39,519
America

1362
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:42,335
New York in LA in

1363
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:43,103
Francisco

1364
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:44,383
But we had

1365
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:47,711
Liberty sorority their butt

1366
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:51,551
Them

1367
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:58,719
Now that's all

1368
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:01,279
Going out

1369
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:02,047
The window and

1370
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:03,071
Show is all of our

1371
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:04,607
Prosperity

1372
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:07,167
Such an important race report

1373
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:11,775
Batman. Video

1374
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:18,687
You do a mask

1375
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:22,015
So yeah to headlines

1376
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:24,831
Some rambling and ever talk about Special Report Gregory

1377
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:27,391
Just bad work

1378
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:29,695
So it's probably no surprise visit

1379
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:31,743
Report about fauci having Mass Graves

1380
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:32,767
Is another misrepresent

1381
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:36,607
Studies that were done between 1985

1382
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:40,703
2005 which were funded by the niaid which traffic is the head of

1383
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:43,519
These were trials and observational studies where the

1384
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:45,823
Participants were children from the New York City Foster

1385
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:46,591
Secure system

1386
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:48,127
Who had HIV AIDS

1387
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:52,735
The investigation found a532 children participate

1388
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:53,503
Disney studies

1389
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:54,271
And up there

1390
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:57,599
25 died while enrolled in a medication trial

1391
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:00,159
That piece of information is being used by

1392
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:00,927
Conspiracy theorist

1393
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:02,463
The claim the child she killed all these

1394
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:03,231
These children

1395
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:04,255
And his mask

1396
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:06,559
In reality the report that

1397
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:07,839
50 figure comes from what

1398
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:10,655
By the Vera Institute of Justice

1399
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:12,959
Delete author on that very

1400
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:15,263
Report told the Associated Press.

1401
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:17,823
The claiming that these deaths were related to the study is

1402
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:19,871
Is completely misleading

1403
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:26,527
Baby was able to review some files and found a quote over the 25 deaths of foster children who were in the clinical trials

1404
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:31,135
The report says that a detailed review found that 22 of these

1405
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:32,415
Twenty-five children

1406
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:34,975
Had developed multiple aids-related complications

1407
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:37,279
Prior to their enrollment in a clinical trial

1408
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:39,327
Several have been enrolled in trial

1409
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:42,655
Designed for those with multiple aids-related complications

1410
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:44,447
Who had exhausted other tree

1411
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:45,471
Treatment opportunities

1412
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:46,495
Her options

1413
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:48,287
This research report is

1414
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:54,687
Honestly feels more like an advertisement for Robert Kennedy Junior's new book about how evil fauci

1415
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:59,295
Yes I mean this is really it's obviously very sad thing

1416
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:00,063
But it's

1417
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:02,367
Very unfair to use this in the way that they're using

1418
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:04,671
It's great that

1419
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:11,071
The Raiders using a pandemic that they exacerbated to exacerbate a pandemic

1420
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:11,839
Exit exit

1421
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:16,191
That's great it's a horrible roast yeah

1422
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:20,031
The snake was all tail

1423
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:22,079
Headline

1424
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:22,847
Sort of

1425
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:25,151
Don't start going through these headlines

1426
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:28,991
Majority of Voters

1427
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:32,063
Concerned about potential of harmful

1428
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:33,087
Side effects

1429
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:41,023
74%

1430
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:41,791
Concerned about

1431
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:48,959
Headline that Alex's reading for Breitbart confused about what the context is

1432
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:51,775
What's the connection between voters and covid side of

1433
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:55,871
Doesn't know what to do with it

1434
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:56,639
That now

1435
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:57,663
I know for a fact

1436
01:06:57,919 --> 01:07:00,991
That Alex either didn't read the story or he's intentionally lying about

1437
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:03,807
Because the 74% figure usciences the people who work

1438
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:05,087
Concerned about side effect

1439
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:06,623
It's actually a difference.

1440
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:11,743
The survey found that nearly three-quarters of respondents 74%

1441
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:13,279
Have been vaccinated

1442
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:15,327
That's the first line of the Arctic

1443
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:18,911
So what's going on here is that Alex just skimmed over the text so number

1444
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:21,983
And decided to report it based on whatever you felt like it might be

1445
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:28,895
That's not the act of someone who's a great guy 24 reality know that's a great guide for reality not a great guy.

1446
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:29,663
Reading

1447
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:30,431
About reality

1448
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:31,199
Oh

1449
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:34,271
I still might Point stamps I think it's

1450
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:36,063
The actual figure is 50

1451
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:38,367
Before percent that are concerned about potential side effects

1452
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:40,671
But only 27% are very concerned

1453
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:44,767
Also this is a Rasmussen poll being reported in Breitbart so who knows what's going on

1454
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:48,607
Anyway the point is that Alex just saw the number 74

1455
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:49,375
Decided to

1456
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:52,191
Label it however he wanted to wish I was

1457
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:56,287
The criminal negligence in recording

1458
01:07:56,543 --> 01:08:00,895
What's the number of heartbeats you have before you die everybody knows that if you just see a number you can

1459
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:04,991
Can say whatever happens after that and it's true what's fascinating is honestly

1460
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:07,551
You said is as true as what

1461
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:10,623
To look he's kind of tired of

1462
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:12,415
News

1463
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:13,695
Sucks

1464
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:19,583
Disgusting into the news

1465
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:21,631
Nobody agrees more than me

1466
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:23,167
So you decide like look

1467
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:24,447
I'm not doing that anymore

1468
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:26,751
It's hard for me to cut a pro wrestling promo

1469
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:27,519
Sure that's

1470
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:30,079
Good Rand Paul I'm coming for you

1471
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:33,919
But you still supported early on now you need to come out against

1472
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:35,711
The whole thing

1473
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:37,759
Doesn't give you immunity

1474
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:40,063
Actor Paul

1475
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:42,367
I know you're not on the enemies team

1476
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:44,927
I know you got bamboozled

1477
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:47,487
American to you

1478
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:48,511
Senator Paul.

1479
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:52,095
He's one of the main reasons you were with warp speed

1480
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:53,887
You were conned

1481
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:55,423

1483
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:00,031
How old is Donald Trump

1484
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:02,079
Nevermind

1485
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:02,847
You don't

1486
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:11,295
I'm not going to sit here and risk my life doing this

1487
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:17,439
I know you're good ramp

1488
01:09:22,047 --> 01:09:24,095
You thought he'd give it to people will say why

1489
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:25,119
You work on

1490
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:27,167
But you're not

1491
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:31,007
Suggest we love you calling for about you spend five years in prison

1492
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:33,311
Love you both

1493
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:42,015
Go all the way here and debate Muir and tell everybody that it's b******* or

1494
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:43,039
Tell me that it's

1495
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:46,111
What honestly think there's no chance

1496
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:48,159
Is going to this

1497
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:49,951
Wrestling shoot Bravo

1498
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:53,023
He's going to have any effect on Rand Paul's Behavior

1499
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:55,071
I still think it's more likely than him debate

1500
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:56,607
I do like

1501
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:58,655
The idea that Alex

1502
01:09:58,911 --> 01:09:59,679
She's like listen

1503
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:01,471
I'm going to be real mad about this

1504
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:02,495
This for the next couple months

1505
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:05,055
And if you don't do anything in the next couple of months

1506
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:07,359
Few months from now eventually

1507
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:11,199
If you don't do anything you will be on Nuremberg trials

1508
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:11,967
Listen

1509
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:14,527
500 times a month for the next

1510
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:20,927
55 years I will be very mad at you also Alex should not be in favor of Nuremberg typed

1511
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:22,975
International law doesn't exist

1512
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:25,023
To look it's fun

1513
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:27,327
The Chute on-ramp off

1514
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:29,119

1515
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:30,399
Do you know what let's

1516
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:31,935
Spread it out a little

1517
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:35,519
Let's talk some s*** about some other people

1518
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:39,615
Get with the program more

1519
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:41,151
DeSantis

1520
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:44,735
Enough

1521
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:47,039
Was a fraud

1522
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:50,623
Who was Ally

1523
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:57,279
All of them

1524
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:05,215
Are you good

1525
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:10,847
So you see what's happening

1526
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:24,927
What is hell

1527
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:36,447
But the point is you can't know all this and do all these other good

1528
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:41,311
Self fraud

1529
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:44,895
Call you and Trump and all you are losing so

1530
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:46,175
Support with your constituents

1531
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:48,735
And they're getting mad at you

1532
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:50,783
Help you

1533
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:52,063
Trying to help you

1534
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:58,463
I actually think you might be right on this will I kind of do too I think you might have really nailed the head on what's going on

01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:03,839
On here that these guys are not understand you will lose your crazy bass

1536
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:05,631
You guys think that you made us crazy

1537
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:08,703
Anybody no no no

1538
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:12,799
This is just more fun but

1539
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:14,335
Because

1540
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:15,871
Doing work

1541
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:19,199
Actually getting into any of these topics is exhausting

1542
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:22,783
I think you have to know where Luxembourg is

1543
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:29,183
Yeah if know what the country very hard to do yourself

1544
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:33,791
Absolutely I'm coming for you on Sunday

1545
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:34,815
I don't like this

1546
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:35,839
I don't like this

1547
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:42,239
Is he trying to go back to being the guy who's Above It All by being so far right

1548
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:43,263
That he can

1549
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:45,311
Say he's not part of a political party

1550
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:47,615
Cuz I'm getting real pissed off about this

1551
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:50,431
I'm seeing I'm seeing this Red Scare bulshit

1552
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:52,479
I've seen those two Dum Dums soccer

1553
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:53,247
Talk to him

1554
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:57,343
I'm seeing the Rogan bulshit I'm seeing them all over places

1555
01:12:57,599 --> 01:13:01,439
And now he's trying to start talking s*** about Trump and Paul and all this stuff

1556
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:03,487
I'm not liking where this is going

1557
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:06,559
Maybe maybe a little bit

1558
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:07,583
I think

1559
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:08,607
I think that

1560
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:12,191
The situation

1561
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:17,567
And I will admit I don't know enough about that podcast to speak about it in any way with any kind of

1562
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:18,847
Actual inch

1563
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:19,615
Information

1564
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:22,687
That is more an instant

1565
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:23,711
Of like

1566
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:25,503
They sent out feelers

1567
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:32,159
Yeah wherever anybody appearance laundering

1568
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:33,695
The left rights

1569
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:35,743
I don't think

1570
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:38,047
He could launder that now I think

1571
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:39,327
It's too cute

1572
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:41,119
Yeah he's too associated with

1573
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:43,167
He spent so much time with

1574
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:44,191
The last

1575
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:47,007
Couple years just being like all Democrats are evil

1576
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:49,823
I think he always tries

1577
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:52,639
To maintain a little bit of that I hate both

1578
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:53,663
Sure

1579
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:54,431
So it's true

1580
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:56,223
What's up

1581
01:13:58,015 --> 01:14:00,063
Can see where you're concerned but I I would

1582
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:08,255
Going to sell but everytime I think people are going to buy something

1583
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:10,559
Most popular product in the world

1584
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:12,095
I don't know

1585
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:14,911
At this point we get to another headline

1586
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:16,959
Another headline

1587
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:18,239
And now

1588
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:19,007
Evil

1589
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:20,543
Wicked

1590
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:23,871
Corporate combine

1591
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:25,151
Is suppressing

1592
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:26,687
Mainline science

1593
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:29,759
Heart Association

1594
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:32,831
Has had their tweets blocked and I meant to be suspended

1595
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:34,367
Publishing

1596
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:35,903
What is on

1597
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:37,951
The Pfizer and moderna injection

1598
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:40,255
Now he can cause a heart attack

1599
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:43,071
That's premeditated Eve

1600
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:46,655
That's not true the American Heart Association

1601
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:48,959
Blocked on Twitter Twitter David Warner

1602
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:54,079
Bring two people who tried to click on a link to this abstract that was on the American Heart association's website

1603
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:56,383
That the link that they were clicking might be unsafe

1604
01:14:57,151 --> 01:14:59,199
You can still go ahead and click on it if you wanted to

1605
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:02,015
The reason putter doesn't generally is winsome

1606
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:02,783
Something is

1607
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:04,831
Being Mass posted by accounts that are off

1608
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:06,111
I'm spamming in nature

1609
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:07,391
They usually are like

1610
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:08,159
Just in case

1611
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:10,719
Dysgraphia

1612
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:13,535
As for this abstract itself it was

1613
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:16,095
Retracted a couple days before Alex is on are here

1614
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:21,215
The American Heart Association was having a meeting and there was like presentations of people giving

1615
01:15:21,471 --> 01:15:24,543
And one of them that was given at the meeting was titled

1616
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:29,407
MRNA covid vaccines dramatically increase endothelial inflammation markers

1617
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:30,943
And ACS Chris

Cardiac tests

1620
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:35,807
A warning

1621
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:36,575

Called circulation

1624

A satirist ran with it is proof that the American Heart Association was saying orthodox

1625
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:47,327
Can cause heart attack

1626
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:50,399
Also was written by a dude who's deep in the

1627
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:51,167
More games

1628
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:52,447

Can circulation

1634
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:06,783
It was brought to the American Heart Association committee on scientific session

1635
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:08,319
Program

1636
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:09,087
Attention

1637
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:11,391
But there are potential errors in the abstract

1638
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:14,463
Specifically there are several typographical errors

1639

This is written in crayon I am confused as to why this made it into art

1648
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:42,879
There's spelling errors and this guy is talking about anecdotal stuff pretending it's scientific

1649
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:46,463

That

1668
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:32,031
A lot of the headlines that Alex reads

If I understand correctly

1690
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:32,959
I

1691
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:39,103
Should be listening to Conor McGregor Conor McGregor Eric Clapton

1692
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:42,175
And other country music stars

1693
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:46,783

That's how it

1699
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:58,303
Listen to Conor McGregor

1700
01:18:58,559 --> 01:18:59,327
And look at

1701
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:00,607
It sounds silly

1702
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:02,655
But Conor McGregor will be

1703
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:05,727
Beat up anybody who stands in the way of Ireland leaving

1704
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:11,359

I would go away a lot too

1708
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:19,551
I'm just saying that maybe there's a lot going on over overlap

1709

He's getting pretty extreme

1713
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:35,935
Kind of saying that he's going to have to save the world

Hair clip like that if you might be inclined to think that I cut out

1721
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:24,576
Space in between

1722
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:28,928
No I'm talking about God's protection and separately

1723
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:38,656
Oh man that separately is carrying a lot of weight

1724
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:39,936
Separately

1725
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:44,544
Completely unrelated this Commerce and my religious beliefs

1726
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:46,592
I think I think

1727
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:48,896
Separately is one of the things he says

1728
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:50,944
The most

1729
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:54,272
I wish it was I'm not mad at the crew

1730
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:56,064
That doesn't come up as often

1731
01:20:57,344 --> 01:20:57,856
Separately

1732
01:20:58,368 --> 01:21:00,672
H-E-B on his tombstone

1733
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:03,488
The adverb that keeps you from going to

1734
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:15,008
I think I think you got a good sense of what's going on but nonsense

1735
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:18,592
Very surface-level storyline

1736
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:22,944
Reset me nothing all kinds of bulshit a desperate attempt to do some work

1737
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:23,712
I think

1738
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:25,504
And then application of

1739
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:27,040
Address to that

1740
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:29,600

Yeah

1744
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:35,232

1745
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:36,000
That's

1746
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:36,768
You know

1747
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:40,864
When your heart's just not in anything but shoot promos Maybe

1748
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:41,632
Take a step back

1749
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:43,168
I can just do some shoe promos

1750
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:45,216
