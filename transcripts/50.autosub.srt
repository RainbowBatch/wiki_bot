00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:50,688
He's been on

00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,712

Sure

15
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:54,272
And

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,392
Killed in the

17
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,512
Tampa Airport

18
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:09,376
Survive the killing

19
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,704
He was on Public Access TV

20
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:17,568
I've looked into up getting a Public Access TV show

21
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:19,360
I got to pay a lot for

22
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:23,968
Courses that make you pay like $100

23
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,504
TV

24
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,784
Production classes

25
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:28,576
Months

26
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,624
Complete the ones you need in order to

27
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,416
To get on TV

28
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,464
If we just shoot our own videos

29
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,256
Mike Play-Doh

30
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:43,168
So conceivably we're going to need that we're going to eat a better Studio that your bedroom if

31
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,960
Would like to donate to the show

32
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,776
That money may go towards us making it TV show

33
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,056
Public Access

34
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,592
Which would also be on YouTube

35
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,128
That's something we're considering

36
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:52,896
That would be

37
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:56,480
Fuckingawesome the spirit of Alex Jones is early career

38
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:59,296
We will do Public Access

39
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,576
I don't even care

40
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:01,600
I would love to

41
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,624
To do Public Access

42
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,024
TV and it I think everybody who has donated we really appreciate it but if people

43
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,816
Throw down a little

44
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:11,840
Something something

45
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,888
We are good we have two projects to work on

46
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,960
But anyway Alex started in public access

47
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,752
Then his dentist father

48
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,544
Talk to one of his patients

49
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,872
Who was a radio executive and got him a radio job

50
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,920
Paper is first ad

51
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:26,944
The American dream

52
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,344
Alex Jones is first Alex Jones is first ad

53
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,112
Closest dad's Dental

54
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:34,880
To the practice

55
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:37,184
He came in to be

56
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:41,536
But really make it big outside of the Austin Market

57
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,840
Where people thought she was kind of a crazy Yeller

58
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,656
Cuz he was so out at hasn't

59
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,960
She would go out in public with bullhorn

60
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:52,544
And make a big spectacle of himself and scream about thanks

61
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,616
And what have you

62
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:59,712
And because he was this crazy public figure that's why Richard linklater

63
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,504
Who wasn't Austin filmmaker

64
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,552
At the time ended up putting him in

65
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,112
And then Scanner Darkly

66
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,696
Very similar to himself

67
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:11,488
Crazy street fight

68
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,256
Creatures

69
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:16,352
Waking Life is a guy yelling at a bullhorn driving around in a car

70
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,032
Stuff like that

71
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:28,128
He's screaming about how the indomitable Spirit of humanity is great

72
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:31,968
He just leaves out all the globalist

73
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:34,784
Just going out on that

74
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,552
On Olympic

75
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,560
Chiropractic at that point

76
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,984
Also Feud I found a f****** episode where Anthony gucciardi and Alex Jones had a little bit of a rat

77
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,752
Obsession

78
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:58,592
How about doctor groups backstory f****** crazy

79
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,640
It's like a comic book

80
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,408
I'll give you

81
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:04,736
I'll give you the free version of it is a

82
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,016
Crazy Austin

83
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,808
Not real doctor doctor

84
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,856
Life is based out of Dallas

85
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,488
Text non-documentary has a place called the global healing in

86
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,256
Institute or whatever

87
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:19,327
Global Healing Center

88
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,143
My chiropractor

89
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,423
Preschool

90
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:26,751
Abby has a bunch of other b******* degree than homie

91
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,567
Homeopathic medicine

92
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,103
But

93
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:33,663
Anthony gucciardi

94
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,943
About how

95
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,967
Dr. group

96
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,527
Is trying to make up for the evils of his father

97
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,807
Apparently

98
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,111
Adductor groups dad

99
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,671
Created a bunch of these things that are talk

100
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:47,487
Toxify in the atmosphere

101
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:53,375
Doctor group doctor group finds out about this

102
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,191
Turns on his dad

103
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,359
Dedicates his life to creating product

104
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:06,687
Then undo the damage that his father

105
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,991
It's crazy

106
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,039
So crazy

107
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:15,647
Celtic dad was ostensibly a real ties

108
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,439
Probably

109
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:24,863
Porterville

110
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:28,447
The toxicity in the atmosphere created by

111
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,263
Evil scientist father

112
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,567
Hard to tell from watching the clip

113
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:37,151
If this is stuff that they're making up

114
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:42,527
Or if they were smoking weed with Doctor group

115
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,319
He was told them that they like

116
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:48,415
Cool cool also I found evidence

117
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,951
From 2015

118
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,999
That Alex Jones is not lying

119
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,791
About smoking weed once a year

120
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:56,351
What that came out in his divorce

121
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,655
Case customer care

122
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:03,007
Do you said in court during a custody case that he smoked weed once again

123
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,823
Singing 2015

124
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,103
That's crazy

125
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,663
He says he smokes weed wanted to check in on it

126
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:16,063
See what's going on with it see what it does to people

127
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,343
It's not

128
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:20,671
It's not something that just came out of his mouth

129
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,559
Point is he's not

130
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,863
He's not selling boner pills and Waking Life

131
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,911
So that's how he sort of

132
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,447
That's why he's in movie

133
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,055
What is a f****** lunatic and it's fun to listen to a f****** lunatic

134
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,871
But the reason that he ever broke

135
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:40,639
Through Inc

136
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,919
Conspiracy theory

137
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:45,247
And the reason that he got this elevated status

138
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,271
As

139
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,575
Be the champion of conspiracies

140
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,623
What made it really break

141
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:51,903
Was that

142
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,927
Put out a video

143
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:57,279
Where you showed breaking into and infiltrating Bohemian Grove

144
00:06:59,327 --> 00:06:59,839
California

145
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,887
I believe it's in the North

146
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:02,911
North Coast

147
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,751
That wasn't 2000

148
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,335
Allegedly he infiltrated on July 15th

149
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,103
2000

150
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,663
But he made the biggest f****** deal

151
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,455
You made a video

152
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,247
Started

153
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,319
This is sort of the beginning of his documentary Empire

154
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,367
Started getting a lot of

155
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,903
Engine for it because it was this

156
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:24,927
Mysterious place

157
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,463
Powerful people go

158
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:27,999
Alex Jones

159
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:31,839
Belle's himself is the only person who's been able to break in

160
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,887
Can you eat the whole part of it

161
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:34,655
The big

162
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,679
Coup de gras

163
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,703
Is

164
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,983
He got footage

165
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,007
Of The Cremation of

166
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:39,775
Pierce Arrow

167
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,823
Which is the most famous

168
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,615
Part of the video it's a fart

169
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,639
Everyone

170
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,199
Martha you remember cuz the rest of its

171
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:47,967
F****** b*******

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,271
It's a video of a giant

173
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,295
Stone owl

174
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:54,367
Where they burn figure in effigy

175
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,671
He portrays it is at

176
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,975
Pony where they're killing a baby

177
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,767
All this s*** yeah yeah

178
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,583
The realities of the actual ceremony

179
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,423
He presented it as

180
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,959
Like hey

181
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,239

Viper

183
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,847
InStyle I went in there with a

184
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,615
The camera

185
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,175
Got it

186
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,199
I got it

187
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,479
And they can't deny

188
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,247
Fret

189
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,295

00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,903
There's a lot on the line

00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:32,255
Yes

193
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:35,583
I've done a bit of looking into

194
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,863
The realities

195
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,167
Situation and I'm here to say

196
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,959
That I don't believe for a second

197
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,727
His version

198
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,495
End of the story

199
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,799
At all okay

200
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:48,639
So I have posted this I posted

201
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,943
Links to the videos

202
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:53,247
That are important to the evidence

203
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,551
Some people are some internet sleuths

204
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,831
Done some really good work on

205
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,623
But the more important

206
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,695
That he

207
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,743
Is it the one who exposed

208
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,023
Bohemian Grove

209
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,607
And before that no one knew about it was the shadowy place

210
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,399
We're really powerful Elites plan

211
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,959
And I would like to play this news report

212
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,239
From 1981

213
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,543
Now a question

214
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:21,407
What happened Herbert Hoover Jack London and Richard Nixon

215
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:26,015
Volleyball been members of the explosive all-male Bohemian Club

216
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:26,783
Open California

217
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:33,183
Where every year at this time the elite from around the country get together for two-and-a-half weeks of the finding game

218
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,231
Steve Guttenberg has this special

219
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:41,631
Telephone number for more than 2,000 members of San Francisco's exclusive an all-male bohemian

220
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:46,751
At once again descended on Northern California

221
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,663
When will spend some 2,700 Acres of pristine and privately owned Redwood

222
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,431
Woodforest

223
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,967
For 3 months like this

224
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,527
The place is called Bohemian Grove

225
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:01,599
That is located just 80 miles north of San Francisco

226
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,927
The Grove is the Bohemian Club summer retreat

227
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:11,327
And its facilities are hidden beneath left Forest canopy extending south from the banks of Sonoma County is Russian River

228
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:17,215
Century the camp has been a place where climbers and guests from all across America gather to relax

229
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,263
Yeah it is divided into

230
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,103
There is a reason that we don't watch it

231
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,431
Rockstar

232
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:27,967
Miles from overhead

233
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,759
Information

234
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:34,367
It goes into

235
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,647
There's footage

236
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,951
Inside the Bohemian Grove area

237
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:42,047
The people it's remained a Bohemian Grove

238
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,983
19 years before Alex Jones broken

239
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:53,055
Wow that's one piece

240
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:55,103
It's taken away from his I exposed

241
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:59,455
Bishop on the news talking about how the elites

242
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,479
From way back

243
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,247
Even when

244
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,527
F****** Richard Nixon in

245
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,551
Herbert Hoover

246
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,367
Yeah this is been going on for

247
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:10,463
It started a long time ago it started like 100

248
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,767
4 years ago I can't remember exactly

249
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:13,791
Also

250
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,839
The weird thing about 80s music

251
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,631
They can just say all mail

252
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,655
That's

253
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,423
Fine

254
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,191
Yeah

255
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,727
The Bohemian Grove

256
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:24,287
The all-male club and everybody's like

257
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,567
Good we have

258
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,103
Waterfall

259
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,407
So

260
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,223
Fascinating little pieces of Alex being

261
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,247
Completely wrong

262
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:37,599
Which

263
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,159
Years

264
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,695
For Alex Jones broken

265
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,743
A journalist named Philip

266
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,279
Reporting for spy magazine

267
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,095
Infiltrated Bohemian Grove for 6 days

268
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,887
No s***

269
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,935
6 days

270
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:54,495
A couple of excerpts from his column

271
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,311
Glad I quit

272
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,103
For me the trick was getting in

273
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,895
I guess card was out of the question

274
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,967
Club by-laws of State sponsors application

275
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,527
Quick shelter Shelby

276
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,063
And shall contain full information

277
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,343
The guidance of the board

278
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,903
In determining the merits and qualifications of the proposed

279
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,719
No Section 8 article

280
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:17,023
18 was to find a screen for me

281
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,095
Attempts to get a job as a waiter or a valet in one of the camps

282
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:20,863
Spell

283
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,655
In the end I entered myself

284
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,959
Some observers of the Grove warrants

285
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,983
Security was too good

286
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,519
Dick Smith me out immediately

287
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:31,359
I might last 3 hours before they put me in Santa Rosa jail for Trent

288
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:32,895
Lowell Burger

289
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:36,479
A producer with 60 Minutes who used to hunt rabbits in the nearby Hills

290
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:40,575
Remember to Fire Road leading into a site near the grahamsville way street

291
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,879
But sneaking in

292
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:46,207
Others mentioned barbed wire and electronic monitoring devices

293
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,767
The places where the Grove abuts Mount Rio

294
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,815
And helicopters patrolling The Ridge Road

295
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,607
Does the Traverse 3000 Foothills

296
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,631
Inform the Grove

297
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,423
Perimeter

298
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,191
Just f****** walk

299
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,727
One day

300
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:01,567
I drove up to the front gate and got a daunting glimpse of what look like the Grove Sheriff

301
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,871
A barrel like figure in a Smokey the bear hat

302
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:07,199
I set up checkpoints on the Berlin Wall seemed to stretch out behind

303
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,479
But

304
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,527
Myconnection

305
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:16,927
My driver was Mary Moore an Earth Mother type with long silver blonde hair who's the most active member of a distinctively

306
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,743
California left-wing group called The Bohemian Grove action

307
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,511
To network

308
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,303
More agreed to help me get in

309
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,607
Providing me with a sort of Underground Railroad

310
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:30,239
She put in my service a mountain guy who demanded only that I keep the methods he devised for me confidential

311
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,287
He had a keen geographical sense

312
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,079
Add a girlfriend to describe the plant

313
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,871
See magic crystals at the Grove gate

314
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,919
And make them open up of their own accord

315
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:39,967
Could walk in

316
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,527
We didn't do it that way

317
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,575
The great writer

318
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,671
We figure a punchline

319
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:52,255
The Grove security isn't quite what it's reputed to be

320
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,559
The sociologists to its

321
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,839
There was no real security

322
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,631
Yeah

323
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,399
There's that

324
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,263
So the real security is the ledge

325
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:10,175
That's what that's what the real security is probably a lot of security if you try and go into

326
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:12,223
But there's not like snipers posted

327
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,575
Therefore days

328
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:19,391
They just hung out and did all the stuff along with them

329
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:23,999
And one of the things that his disguise was always have a drink

330
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,047
Cuz everybody's drinking

331
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,863
Everyone just drunk bushes

332
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,679
Sprite

333
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,471
A crazy

334
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,007
Super powerful rich

335
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,031
People summertime

336
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:36,799
Yeah

337
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,359
When and we'll get back to that Maseca

338
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,431
But he had to have a reason to be there

339
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:47,551
My imposter included misrepresenting myself in conversation with other campers

340
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:51,391
And my story kept changing as I learned more about how license

341
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,695
I said it was a guest of Bromley

342
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,743
We run sortable visitors end up

343
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,303
A33 I was one of the youngest bohemian

344
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:04,191
Quote we looked around and saw we were becoming an old men

345
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,471
Men's club a member said

346
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,751
Explaining recent Everett

347
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,543
Efforts to recruit fresh blood

348
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,335
Being from New York was fine

349
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,359
The Grove limits

350
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,127
Retreat guest

351
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,151
Out-of-staters

352
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,479
No clamoring by well-connected Californians to visit the forest

353
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,039
Has resulted in the rise of the jeans

354
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:19,807
Jynx weak

355
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,855
I don't know what that means

356
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,391
I used miles

357
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,695
I used my real name

358
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,975
Noah

359
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,999
No one

360
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,535
No one inside Act

361
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,303
Suspicious

362
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,839
But paranoia about the Groves

363
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:32,863
Justified

364
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:35,167
And I brought along my own version of cyanide

365
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,447
Funeral

366
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,263
A tranquilizer used by actors to counteract stage

367
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:43,615
One day member asked if I was related to a bohemian

368
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:46,687
No but I've heard a lot about him and I'd like to meet him

369
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,223
You can't he said

370
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:48,991
He's dead

371
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:52,575
After that I began working a dead Westcoast relatives promise

372
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:57,183
To have me out to the Grove One Summer into my Shaggy Dog story about an invitation

373
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,999
Very nice so basically he's in the B

374
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,559
He's just hanging out with these people and

375
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:06,911
I'm hanging out drinking with these powerful people

376
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:10,495
He ends up bring the camera on the last days is that guys like I kicked out

377
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:13,055
What up whatever is my last day here

378
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:19,455
He goes to The Cremation of care ceremony that Alex

379
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,759
Videotape and misrepresent

380
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,807
That is some sort of a satanic thing

381
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,879
The reality of it is

382
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:29,695
Is that The Cremation of care ceremony is this thing

383
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:33,279
Where Uvalde super powerful people live crazy stressful live

384
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,047
It's much

385
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:34,815
The same as like

386
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:37,375
Really rich people often go to the dominatrix

387
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,679
To get the power taken away

388
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,727
Rubber Eva symbolic power

389
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:42,751
Exchange

390
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,287
In the same way

391
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:47,359
The super somebody who's in control all the time nothing is

392
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,919
Tantalizing

393
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,199
Exactly

394
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:55,807
And in this case these people have such scrutinize lies and such stress

395
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,623
The B go to this place where they can privately let loose

396
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,159
Maybe do some gay stuff

397
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:02,463
Get drunk all the time

398
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,255
That put on little musical numbers

399
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,047
Have people give speeches

400
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,887
Basically a lot of what goes on that there's a lot of

401
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:10,911
Politics

402
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:13,727
Discussion that goes on now too much more

403
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,263
That

404
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,055
It's a borg

405
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:23,455
Answer The Cremation of care ceremony is where you have a manifestation of care

406
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,503
Who comes in this is this this

407
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,783
What is

408
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,087
And it is this this

409
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,111
This idea of

410
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:33,183
The stresses and the cares of the outside world

411
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,743
They bring it in on a on a boat

412
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,767
A pontoon boat

413
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,559
Do this ritual space

414
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,863
In front of the giant owl is wisdom

415
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,399
The giant owl moloch

416
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:47,263
Is voiced by Walter Cronkite

417
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,055
And so they have this ritualistic

418
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:54,943
Play we're in all of the cares of the outside world

419
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,991
Only able to

420
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,015
To be burned by the

421
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,551
The Everlasting Flame

422
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,599
That never goes out throughout the

423
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:07,487
Entire weeks-long in a sex prop

424
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:10,815
Yeah and I think it's f****** awesome that sounds amazing

425
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:15,935
Stupid but I want I want to go and get chips I would go in a heartbeat

426
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,471
Yeah I could have gone

427
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:22,079
I don't care that it's quote the faggy is goddamn Nixon

428
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:26,431
Direct quote from Nixon

429
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:30,015
It's a good thing Alex Jones got in there to expose it

430
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,551
So those are

431
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:34,111
Two things that happened over a decade before Alex

432
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:36,159
Ostensibly allegedly

433
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,975
To the toilet

434
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:41,791
This guy Philip Weiss I really record

435
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:46,655
Is article here about his infiltration

436
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,423
Because it's

437
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:50,751
First of all he's a great writer

438
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,031
It's pithy

439
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:58,431
It's witty it really great and it's a really interesting window into sort of the reality of what believe mean

440
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:01,503
Club that Alex is satanic

441
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,319
It's like at Hunter S Thompson didn't

442
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:11,231
So the other problem

443
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,023
Who

444
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,071
Movie that he put out his documentary

445
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,351
About breaking

446
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,631
Bohemian Grove

447
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,911
Is that

448
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:21,983
A couple people have done some really good analysis on it

449
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:26,591
One question keeps jumping out and that is

450
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,871
Why do all of the

451
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,687
The craziest

452
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,455
Mangrove

453
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,991
Why is none of that on cam

454
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,807
Why is that just Alex's

455
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,831
Narration

456
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:37,855
Over

457
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,879
Shots of trees

458
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,159
And stuff like

459
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,463
He talks about how he sees

460
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,231
Surveillance

461
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:47,583
Equipment everywhere wires going all around the trees

462
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,119
None of that is on camera

463
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,655
He talks about

464
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,679
All sorts of things

465
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,983
And none of it is presented within the documentary

466
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,007
Further

467
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,799
He says that he gets

468
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,079
Accosted by Sheriff

469
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,103
On his way in

470
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,127
To try and break in

471
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,687
He just says that it happened

472
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:05,247
There's no reason to believe that it actually happened

473
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,319
What are you making a documentary you really got to show and prove

474
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,343
What you're doing

475
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,879
Instead.

476
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:14,719
The strong suit instead what they do have is shaky footage of trees

477
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,999
When he's allegedly

478
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,279
Hiking

479
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,559
To break into the

480
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,375
He made the Blair Witch Project

481
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,399
It's found footage

482
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,679
Yeah exactly

483
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:24,959
The other problem

484
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:25,983
Is

485
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,519
He's walking around in the

486
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,055
Trees

487
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,847
Santa's half-an-hour later

488
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:37,503
Create the illusion that he hiked around in the woods to find its way up

489
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,831
Like to hear on knowledge fight.com

490
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,391
This guy

491
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,671
Took Google Maps

492
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,719
And found the spot

493
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,255
Exactly where Alex was

494
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,279
Sometimes I love

495
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,351
It's so amazing

496
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:55,679
Basically what he ended up doing that

497
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,959
Is walked

498
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,727
About 50

499
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,799
He made almost like doodoo

500
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,847
Area that he would have to walk

501
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,895
To get to where he says he ends up

502
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:05,663
This parking

503
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:06,943
Parking area

504
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,527
And gets picked up five

505
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,319
What is so close

506
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,343
To the external Road

507
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,391
There's no way that it would take half an hour

508
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,184
Even with his bloated

509
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,488
Out of shape ass

510
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,512
Fresno

511
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,304
It's just literally impossible

512
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,840
The only explanation

513
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,608
He got it in

514
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:26,656
No

515
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,216
Conspiracy theorists

516
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:32,800
A lot of weirdos

517
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,080
Heart of the globalist

518
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:37,152
That makes perfect

519
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,176
Perfect right

520
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,736
The more likely reality

521
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,088
Is Alex Jones took a nap

522
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,112
It's Alex Jones

523
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,672
Psyching himself out in the middle of the Woods

524
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,720
He's afraid

525
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,792
That's possible and that's why

526
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,096
Possibility is

527
00:21:56,352 --> 00:22:00,192
He wants to presented as it's super hard to get in but as Philip.

528
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,728
It's really not all that

529
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,312
Necessarily

530
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,408
Or whatever

531
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:14,272
I think that the shuttle that shows up

532
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:17,856
So if you're in the Bohemian Grove parking area which is clearly accessible

533
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:22,464
Really as we've not far from the road

534
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,024
If you're in

535
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,072
Cuz it's just a shuttle that runs

536
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:27,840
Consistently

537
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,632
So he gets it there

538
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,680
Airport shuttle

539
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:34,240
The problem is if you look at it

540
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,568
When you get picked up by the shuttle

541
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,592
MN

542
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,128
There's not a whole lot

543
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:41,152
The goes on

544
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,432
I meant he has footage

545
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,968
The Cremation of care ceremony

546
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,248
And its pitch black

547
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,296
It's just completely dark out

548
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:49,088
Right

549
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:49,856
He must

550
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:53,440
Footages

551
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:56,512
Hey Zach I went to this place this place in this place

552
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:58,816
Damn

553
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,096
It's super dark out

554
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,120
It's the dead of

555
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:04,192
They don't show how they leave

556
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:06,496
So

557
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:08,800
Higher career

558
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:11,360
Is built on something

559
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,896
People have already done

560
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:16,480
Yeah and he's clearly edited in a way that is

561
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,272
Manipulative

562
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,064
Play the most liked most likely

563
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,344
Didn't even really

564
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:24,160
The most likely scenario is that it

565
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,000
I imagine maybe Securities lease up now

566
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:34,400
Just because they're horrifying world religion for 1,000

567
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:36,960
Isabel

568
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,776
I think that they're like here's my

569
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:43,104
Real world scenario what I say

He knew that this was a very opportunistic way he could make a name for himself

572
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,248
Cuz he wasn't cutting it

573
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:51,040
As a local conspiracy guy

574
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:53,600

We have to get some

583
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:16,896
Of course so he knows he can sneak in pretty easily but he have to present it is really difficult cuz otherwise

584
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:19,200
Sacred Space that he's broken into it's just

585
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,480

If you put that out

593
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:44,288

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,728
It does look like

608
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,776
Weird

609
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:21,408
It's not like

610
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:28,064
Knowledge has changed my ability to be like f****** weird on the same level of taking communion

611
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,416

Never wrestled

617
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:44,960
The fact that

618
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:48,544
He's lying

619
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:53,664
Another subtitle to The Alex Jones

00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,432
Biography

621
00:25:54,944 --> 00:26:00,064
Never wrestled with the fact that he's lying it's perfect so cuz you have all these powerful people

622
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:03,648
It is a real social club that tons of

623
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:06,720
Elites in business and politics go to

624
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:07,744
And

625
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:11,072
If you can use that as a way to connect them all

626
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:14,144
In some sort of shadowy evil organization

627
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,240
Satanic

628
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,288
Exactly and unfortunately

629
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,336
Upon scrutiny none of it

630
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,360
Matches up

631
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,408
None of it is real Alex

632
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:26,688
You're busted

633
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,480

You 90% but

637
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,792
He claims that a lot of the reason that there's not

638
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,072
Footage of a bunch of stuff

639
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,608
It's cuz he's using one hour

640
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,144
1 hour-long tape

641
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,960
But even if that's true

642
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:49,984
Bears

643
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:55,872
At least like there have to be 20-something hours of footage that wasn't

644
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,688
