00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:10,496

00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:16,896
Little bit

4
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:23,296
What up how do you feel about the Big Bang

5
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:29,696
Rip them up for Financial Protection Bureau is unnecessary

6
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:31,744
Never been more aligned with Alex Jones

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,144
Homes for the wrong reasons so I want to crush the bank

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,216
Because it's groovy out of a couple bucks.

9
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:47,616
That's all it takes to get me to completely become a guy

10
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:55,296
You think that's part of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs

11
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:10,400
God it's so brutal it's so brutal to be poor and then has the bank

12
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,424
F*** you

It happened to me in the past before 2 and it's just it

16
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:24,992
Feel so shity there's like nothing you can do

17
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:29,088
They don't give a fuk about you they don't care

18
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,392
Their fault

19
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:34,464
They made a glitch and now you don't have your money

20
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:41,376
My soapbox for hey I got screwed out of a couple bucks

21
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,936
Absolutely don't want to create a like some sort of

22
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:51,872
We're talking about

23
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,152

Come up over the course of this episode

25
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:02,880

Open the movie

32
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:25,152
I try to stay away from modern-day Alex Jones but I wish I could quit

33
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,432
So today we're in the car

34

Afternoon

39
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,536
In the world of world you know with Michael Cohen pleading guilty to

40
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,304
Equally striking

41
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,864
Adeel wherein he implicated

42
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,448
The president in court hilarious

43
00:02:55,104 --> 00:03:01,248

Middlesex standall interpass

45
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:12,768
Like first of all the court in court.

46
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,816
And then also

47
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:17,120
You know said it was for the

48
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,400
Like for the sake of

49
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:19,680
Election

50
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:20,960
Ikea

51
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,728
Besides those

52
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,800
Hey I'm guilty because of campaign Finance

53
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:28,640

00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,832
Is that a lion and I was alone with him

56
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:41,440
Paul manafort was found guilty on eight out of 18 charger

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,144
He has another trial coming up where am I

58
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:56,544
It's so like there's a lot going on that I don't know if you were following the Donkey

59
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,312

61
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:04,480
I don't remember his name because that

62
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:08,576
Name some made-up the filing against

63
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,624
Taking campaign funds

64
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,440
For personal expenses people have

65
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:15,744
Dunking on him because of all right

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,024
Be specific things

That are in the in the filing.

68
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:24,959
32nd and tiny little expenses that he stole things from

69
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:25,727
Before

70
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,311
Eventually

71
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,591
There's a lot of bad stuff

72
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,127
Conservative

73
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,151
Broke

74
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,175
In the afternoon

75
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,455
But I wonder if Alex

76
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:36,991
Knew it was coming

77
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:41,087
First of all he talks about any of it as a break

78
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,647
Bright on air when those

79
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,743
Staff is like at least check

80
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,767
Twitter every

81
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,583
To get in there

82
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,351
See if there was any

83
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,143
That's why we're still in the

84
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,567
Most troubling clip

85
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,359
That we have ever played on this show

86
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,151
2 years into the show

87
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,431
We played

88
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:12,831
So many f****** Clips better deliver this empty

89
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:16,927
Either is no way for this to fall play we have played clip

90
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:21,535
Where Alex admits that he spoke to Russian intelligence when I thought it was

91
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:25,375
We have heard him talk about killing dog

92
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,167
We have talked about

93
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:32,031
Larry Nichols coming on the show and straight-up blackmailing Congress on the radio

94
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:35,871
None of that compares to the clip that I'm going to play you in the middle of the show

95
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,663
I am not teasing the tooth much

96
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,943
You guys are going to love it

97
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,479
It made me gasp

98
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,503
I almost

99
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,783
Threw something across the room

100
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,807

You kill my dog

103
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:54,047
The same time it makes perfect sense

104
00:05:54,559 --> 00:06:00,703

105
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,471

Diamond gusset stickers on this excellent

00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:10,367
Get the free and fair election at the end of the day

193
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,927
Everything's got Asterix all over X

194
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,207
Turn up

195
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:19,327
How did the Hall of Fame is no doubt

196
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:25,983
I don't want to I want to break this down

197
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,007
Throughout

198
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,103
Hitler that's another 1,000

199
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:38,783
Nothing I think it was probably when pooping one last

200
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:41,855
97% of the vote

201
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,671
To win with only 96% of the vote

202
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:48,255
And he outperform Landslide Landslide victory

203
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,559
A mandate is what that is

204
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,887
I think Alex is a little bit

205
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:54,911
Screwed

206
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:55,935
His little bit

207
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,799
It's all good

208
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,335
I played a baby

209
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,895
And that's what he doesn't

210
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,175
He plays his game

211
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,967
Pretty fun

212
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:11,807
We could probably take him up on this but it's absolutely not worth our

213
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,815
That's why I'm offering a $1000000

214
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,095
We need this

215
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:28,959
Contact we needed

216
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,079
There is no video

217
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,175
Its total

218
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,967
Lester Holt

219
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:43,295
Lester Holt

220
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,999
Criminal activity

221
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:56,351
The judicial system

222
00:13:56,863 --> 00:14:00,703
That's not quite right after anybody who can

223
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,727
You claim that he's like

224
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,543
Threatening the media and being really violent about them

225
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,079
I could win that

226
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,383
In a second

227
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,759
Throughout this episode quite frankly there's no video or clips

228
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,527
Give me saying

229
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:20,927
Take the battle rifle Fairplay Alex but whatever you're looking

230
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,951
42u

231
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,975
Either going to give them

232
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,327
It's a it's a hopeless Quest

233
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,095
But

234
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,631
We could we could definitely put together

235
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:35,007
Private more time was yelling at a bank called I probably could have put together a super clip of him threaten

236
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:41,663
It happens a lot more

237
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,431
But

238
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,711
You should know that they're lying

239
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:47,039
And that's why he's comfortable with his million-dollar offer that he opted

240
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:53,439
Which is exactly why testifying

241
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:58,815
Correct

242
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,839
To correct

243
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:04,959
Dino's as we talked about on the last episode

244
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:09,311
Because the media is about to false-flag them

245
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,079
Themselves

246
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,639
In order to blame the Patriots

247
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:16,223
Which is why again it's fine for the Patriots to go out and murder everybody at the

248
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,087
His opinion that Alex has decided to

249
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:23,135
Turn into one of his main talkingpoi

250
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:26,463
Everyone

251
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:39,263
American people

252
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,079
You can see it

253
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:48,223
And I told you you know firestick

254
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,551
Open Water

255
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,975
Houses burn down

256
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,767
That's funny

257
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:34,559
To do it

258
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,615
That's great that's not bad

259
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:55,551
The crazy neighbor is saying that

260
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,343
You are going to burn down his house

261
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,111
Beforehand

262
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,647
Or something like that

263
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,183
It has nothing to do with your house

264
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:07,583
And then he burns his own house in order to frame you for

265
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,863
Help your houses birthday

266
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,655
Is metaphor doesn't really hold

267
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,935
It kind of makes no sense

268
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:13,727
I don't expect

269
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:14,751
Make much sense because

270
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,567
Preemptive narrative building

271
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:20,127
So when something does happen

272
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,151
The shot of the journalist

273
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,175
Alexander

274
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:22,943
Conscience

275
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:25,759
It's it really

276
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,551
Really f****** disgusting

277
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:31,903
To know that in League with the guy who is saying that the media is our enemy

278
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,207
And they should be destroyed

279
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:40,351
Is the guy who saying don't worry about it because the media is doing it to themselves

280
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,143
Like what are you

281
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:42,911
You f******

282
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,679
Talking about

283
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:46,751
The definition of gaslighting should something

284
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,543
And even if it doesn't

285
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:49,823
But you don't

286
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,871
We don't really get to know the

287
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,919
Private goings-on

288
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,199
These journalists but a lot of time

289
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:56,991
Brett they've gotten

290
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,527
And things like that and you'd

291
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,575
Just have to extrapolate in your mind

292
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,855
How much more is it

293
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,903
That you don't

294
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,207
When people have to deal with that a whole lot

295
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:10,815
And they shouldn't when you consider when you factor in the

296
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:11,583
Matthew

297
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:14,399
Massive Rising hate crime

298
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:17,215
That have been committed

299
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,495
Trump was allowed to

300
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:21,311
Speak out loud German study

301
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,591
About that Facebook

302
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:30,783
Merkel Merkel who-knows-what

303
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:38,975
Keeping it away REI

304
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:43,583
Broad Strokes of bounds even if you separate

305
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,863
Sorts of other demographic

306
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,631
Features like

307
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,655
Class

308
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,703
Income brackets race

309
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,239
Political affiliation

310
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,031
They found it in place

311
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:52,799
Where

312
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:55,871
Facebook usage was one derivation

313
00:18:56,127 --> 00:19:00,991
What's the typical derivation away from the center right

314
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:03,295
Then the incident

315
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:11,743
So they did like what a regression analysis that said that there is a correlation

316
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,303
It's not causation

317
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,751
Indicate that no matter what where you fall on the lot of Spectre

318
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:26,079
The inundation of b******* online

319
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,615
Radicalized

320
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,175
So I don't know

321
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,455
They don't communicate with

322
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,015
I think that makes more sense

323
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:38,623
Yeah we need to wolof Chicago

324
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:45,023
That would be an interesting for him to lose weight

325
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:45,791
Yeah

326
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:48,351
F*** Gary Indiana we got to get rid of those guys

327
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,143
Perhaps

328
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:53,215
You know what that actually might solve our gun running

329
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:58,847
It's true

330
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:05,503
There's no way that people run guns from one state to another

331
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,063
Would get around that

332
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:12,159
Impossible

333
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:16,767
Your idea for Illinois politics

334
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,047
Evolution

335
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:22,655
Another disintegrate

336
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,215
Use but I have to do this kronologic

337
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:29,311
Craziest clip

338
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:34,943
I think I've ever heard a little bit

339
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:39,039
Dog scream over there

340
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,319
Google

341
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:44,159
Google would love to have me arrested and killed

342
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:08,735
We got to go from the town Google Google

343
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:12,319
Kill

344
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,159
Technically one guide

345
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:16,928
Cheers bar

346
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:25,376
A guy that you want to hear

347
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,168
Technically I didn't kill

348
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:32,800
Technically

349
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:39,200
Finish the job and did you hear how it almost sounded like you said a few

350
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:45,600
You years ago

351
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:48,160
Was to it wasn't like I

352
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:54,560
You f****** killed a guy so he got so here's what I'm hearing out of that until I got fight of some

353
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:57,632
Health problems

354
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,400
Alex

355
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:02,496
Exact murder that guy

356
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:03,776
Alex killed a guy

357
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:07,872
Specifics

358
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,408
Kind of irresponsible

359
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:11,200
Accept what we can say is

360
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,736
By his own

361
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:20,416
I think you killed a guy kill the guy

362
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:25,792
Responsible for a murder

363
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:28,352
I feel like they should be a lot more going on if you go

364
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:31,168
Glycogen

365
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,264
I didn't

366
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,032
But but

367
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:39,104
You would never have brought it up and gone down there road if there wasn't some

368
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,736
Kernel of something in the back of his mind I did do that I am responsible

369
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,760
Murderer

370
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,552
Bart Lisa manslaughter

371
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,368
Children

372
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:55,488
He's a mass murderer by the owner

373
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:58,816
Alex is the serial killer we always assumed that he was

374
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,864
Throwing

375
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,424
Are killing dogs and that's the natural

376
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,704
Sort of jumping off point

377
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:11,104
For the first thing that you see

378
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,640
Absolutely

379
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,176
I'm I'm willing to

380
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,968
You credit as

381
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:19,552
Murderer Alex

382
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:24,160
So we got to start back over the beginning of eclipse

383
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:24,928
Because I think

384
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,280
The craziest clip I've ever heard

385
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,048
Is

386
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,584
The confession of murder

387
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,936
Like I think there's a part of his brain Psych

388
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,240
I meant you can

389
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,032
Turning kind of

390
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:40,800
Any jump

391
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:41,824
To like

392
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,920
I'm going to distract everyone so they don't realize what I just forgot

393
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:51,808
Google Google would love to have me arrested and killed

394
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,672
Technically one guy

395
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,104
Alex Jones was mean to the Sandy Hook family

396
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,512
Democratic

397
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,304
Kill the guy

398
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:40,704
Alright

399
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:45,056
It's like he's about to fall off a

400
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:48,128
Forklift

401
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,664
And then

402
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:58,112
New grip

403
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,392
Exactly

404
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:02,976
And hold any like alright alright I can climb I can climb from here

405
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:09,376
Gene Wilder's the ghost of the guy that killed waiting at the bottom

406
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:11,680
I'm just staring like

407
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:14,240
Holy s*** right

408
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:19,360
Who did he kill

409
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,640
No

410
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:27,296
Murder stays murder

411
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:33,440
Tell that story

412
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:34,720
God

413
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:38,048
Also recording

414
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:38,816
Coast AM

415
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,608
And if I'd heard this clip

416
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,632
Before that

417
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,424
You bet your ass I would have called in

418
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:47,264
Gildedguy

419
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,824
So holyshit

420
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:53,408
We need to know more about that I don't know if we'll ever get to the bottom

421
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:56,480
Congratulations Alex you just admitted on-air that

422
00:25:56,736 --> 00:26:02,880
You probably killed a guy

423
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:09,024
He killed a guy if you are the guy that Alex killed please call 503

424
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,816
Yeah also by the way

425
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,376
I know

426
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:14,912
I forgot to do that at the top of the

427
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:21,312
I remembered we have a call

428
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:25,920
Listen to like

429
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:32,832
Jinx moment that's what is like

430
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:46,144
I don't know I did

431
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,168
From the podcast

432
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:50,752
Very few

433
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:52,288
Once again so that's

434
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,872
Cleanse our love

435
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,152
We got a very awesome

436
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,320
Is Alex mazzoni a killer

437
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:07,136
Maybe we did not get a call from Chico

438
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,928
Nor did we get a call that Alex killings

439
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:09,696
Somebody

440
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:10,976
We've got our first

441
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:13,280
International message

442
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,048
Hello

443
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:18,144
I'm just calling to say thanks

444
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:18,912
Airport

445
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,448
You can show that you do

446
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:22,240
It's that very helpful

447
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:25,056
Tuesday's at work so that's good

448
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:27,872
I know I'm probably

449
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,408
Tell you come here and do it live

450
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,320
Anyways that was about it. Just

451
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:59,360
Diminished expectations

452
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:05,760
Coming out your view of Europe

453
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:12,416
Country code

454
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:14,464
Is that why

455
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,680
Time support of the shower

456
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:27,008
You're the best

457
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:32,128
To hear your voice also

458
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,920
Why didn't you tell us about Allie

459
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:39,808
Killer guy Sonia you knew it if you can call a miracle you could have figured that s*** out way in advance

460
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:41,600
I thought that we were doing that to get us off

461
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:46,208
Excellent topic is hard to move on

462
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,280
Bananas so now let's let's try our best

463
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:50,816
Deal with it

464
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:53,632
Now we see Alex through the prism of murder

465
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:02,848
Prism of murder

466
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:04,896
Supremacy part of his rhetoric

467
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:11,040
What is Wikipedia

468
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:11,808
New layers of

469
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:15,136
And I don't know if there's any more

470
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,416
Gildedguy

471
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:20,000
How do we defeat him is the same person anymore when he's drunk

472
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,792
For Lauren it's no longer like

473
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,376
Some guilt

474
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:31,776
Over killing a guy like hardcore

475
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,568
Him after killing a guy

476
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,896
Excused

477
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:40,736
He doesn't give like a little bit of sleep because you

478
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,784
He's too busy working on the Infowars because

479
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:50,720
Someone jokingly

480
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,768
Assume that he had killed a guy

481
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,584
It is still jarring to hear that him say

482
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:56,608
I killed

483
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:00,192
Not technically

484
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:02,496
Yeah

485
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:09,152
Goodyear Auto f****** radio show man you just say I've never killed a guy no one's going to be like yes you have

486
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:11,200
I okay

487
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:13,504
Killed a guy with my car

488
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:19,392
Technically the health problems so drunk I was in the passenger seat

489
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:25,792
The time until problems all right

490
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:29,888
Temple murdered

491
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,448
Alright okay so now

492
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:36,544
Will get on to another topic here in that is Alex

493
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,080
Completely lie

494
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,640
About what is very clearly a timeline about

495
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:41,408
George Soros

496
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,736
Using a mouse Playbook

497
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:48,576
You think they're playing games

498
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:52,672
Playing games they're funded by collaborator

499
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:05,216
But it would be the MacNeil Lehrer hour back then but also

500
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:08,032
You didn't know about Soros

501
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,312
Before you didn't know about him

502
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,080
Since you were at

503
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,104
Velvet

504
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:11,872
Bulshit

505
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,200
Even 2090 list

506
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,760
All of his arch globalist his main enemies

507
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:19,552
Soros has never come up

508
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,088
I found one clip

509
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,160
Brings up George Soros

510
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,696
Alex

511
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:30,304
Doesn't register it at all

512
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:34,144
And bring them up is not even as IQ

513
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,960
It's just that he's a rich dude who doesn't agree with

514
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,776
He's not even in terms of like

515
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:41,056
He's a mastermind

516
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:45,152
Alex Smith

517
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:46,432
So

518
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:51,296
He's known about him as some sort of monster who overthrows

519
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:55,904
Piece of his

520
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,184
So I like that

521
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,000
I like that

522
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:02,048
Alex

523
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,072
Ironic defense

524
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,352
China

525
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:05,888
The mouse Playbook

526
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,728
So that kind of undercut

527
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:11,008
Flickr

528
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:13,824

He's not done talking about Sora

538
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,600
Unless episode talked about how

539
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:59,648
For Lauren to get him on SNL

540
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:00,928
Alex Smith

541
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,976
Free characters

542
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:09,376

He's doing is a

548
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,920
The commercial from the

549
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:24,736
From McDonalds where there was a guy with Down Syndrome

550
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:25,504
McDonald's

551
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,040
Answer that is what

552
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,320
He's making fun of

553
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,600
Which makes it even more of a

554
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:37,280
To fair when we make fun of how bad that impression

555
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:39,328
Bring into it that he's making fun of

556
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,680
Man

557
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:44,960
He sucks

558
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:47,520
But how much better and worse of places

559
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,288
But it wasn't

560
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,312
Yeah

561
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,848
Jordan

George Soros

00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,064
Lightly meat

Dracula

I'm disposed to rollover some crazy Nazi Collaborators

570
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:13,376
Woodstock battery worshipping you

00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,984
It was happy making time

572
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,568
And I would help round up

573
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,592
I'll say

574
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:23,616
Right now

575
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,152
Not the worst impression

576
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,272
He's like

577
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:34,368
Right right I mean the content of it is

578
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:36,672
Hot bowls

579
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:39,488
He's in the ballpark of Hungarian

580
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:45,376
It's not too far off

581
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,400
Not

582
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,216
Dizzy

583
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:51,776
I don't like I don't like the mixing up

584
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:52,544
This is Beth at 2

585
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,080
Know that

586
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:58,176
Quality

587
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:58,944
Better

588
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,480
Done so much worse

589
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:01,760
And he's about to

590
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:11,744
In my life

591
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:18,144
Dracula's Forest

592
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:24,544
Chocolate

593
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:37,088
Is this delicious Pro Star Wars references

594
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:46,560
Germany

595
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:50,400
But not Soros

596
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,192
He doesn't get shipped

597
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:54,752
Pizza Man

598
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:58,848
Because he wasn't a Nazi

599
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,128
Hey Alex

600
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:04,736
Are you mad

601
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,528
Are you mad about that

602
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:10,624
I don't know why

603
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:17,280
If you're not see why are we deporting all nothing because we would get rid of

604
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:20,352
If we go for that argument I'm I'm listening

605
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:26,752
I'm listening right right sure sure we can do

606
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,032
Bye

607
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,056
If your Arc

608
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:29,824
Argument is

609
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,896
Why are we getting rid of it get rid of George Soros

610
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:33,920
I would say

611
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:36,480
Very substantial

612
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,272
He's not a Nazi never was

613
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,296
Right

614
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,112
It does make it seem like he does

615
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,904
Want that old guy deported

616
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:46,464
If his argument were

617
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:48,768
5

618
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,816
Like let him die

619
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,352
Then I'd listen

620
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:57,472
Probably not worth it to go through the rigmarole of deporting him

621
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:58,752
On the other hand

622
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:05,152
He's a f****** not see it if he's uncomfortable at 95

623
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:09,504
Yeah

624
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,784
I agree

625
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,832
Logistical argue

626
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,160
But I don't give a s***

627
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:21,024
And I also I'm not Charmed by arguments that are like why we deported this guy when we could do more

628
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:25,120
Profit loss statement

629
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,008
You got your losing more money to put in the guy that you would be if you just left him alone but

630
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,800
How to unlock

631
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:39,200
Sure sure

632
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,224
Yeah

633
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:42,528
Anyway

634
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,576
Alex

635
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:52,768
The world has become so f***** up that the feel-good story

636
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:04,032
Well at least we got one Nazi out of here or like 56 years ago it was

637
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,824
Tranquilized bear falls out of

638
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:13,504
Everybody can feel great about

639
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:26,560
You yell at me over

640
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:29,888
Circle.com

641
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:34,496
That's not good that's a sign of a bad times

642
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:37,056
No

643
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:40,640
Also that's a that's a real bad scoreboard for us in the Nazis

644
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:41,408
Still

645
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:47,296
We return to Havana president

646
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,160
Knows that

647
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:52,928
He is a man

648
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:54,720
You do that

649
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:55,744
So he's a man

650
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:58,560
He's not afraid

651
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,096
Like a

652
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:02,144
Monstrous idea of a

653
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,936
He's like bonecrusher

654
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:04,960
He's never scared

655
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:05,984
That's what I'm talkin

656
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:07,520
Globalist

657
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,080
But he's not afraid of them

658
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:16,224

I don't want to be with you

And the father and the Holy Spirit

666
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:20,224
Across the world

667
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,504
This is our last chance

668
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:24,320
And Trump is a final

669
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:25,600
On the way to hell

670
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:31,232
Now at the end

Open for somebody who claims that he wants to go towards good energy

Oh no

Text Lyle.

764
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:15,039

The 2nd hour

771
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:44,479
But

772
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,271
What I couldn't tell if Alex

773
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:48,063
David Knight with taking over

774
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,599
Because he played a like

775
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:50,879
4minute long

776
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:51,647
Promo

777
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:54,463
The real news

778
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:58,559
Because it's the only one you can still find anywhere in the promo of it

779
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:00,351
Dick goes from like

780
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:01,375
I'm doing an introduction

781
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,143

Promo

784
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:11,871
Package

785
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:12,639
Involved

786
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:13,919
Coming in from break

787
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:15,199
Import of his real ship

788
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:15,967
What is going

789
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:17,247
Is very confused

790
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,527
But you didn't

791
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:19,807
The news is probably the only thing I

792
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:29,023
He's not sorry snowflakes Panhandle true eStore hose

793
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:33,631
Peanuts dharius snowflakes can't handle this s*** bro

794
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:38,495
Everyone can handle David night shift yeah I think so

795
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:40,799
Still allowed on all of these platforms

796
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:42,079
Everyone even

797
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,615
Even everyone who is

798
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,663
Piling on with Alex's light

799
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:50,527
0

800
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:52,319
David Knight

801
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:55,135
Usually no one can

802
00:47:55,391 --> 00:48:01,279
0 there's no positive or negative he's just there has mostly most of his appearances Alex trying to

803
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:05,887
Also David Knight talking a lot about the

804
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:06,655
The fourth turning

805
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:08,959
Charge that philosophy that Steve Bannon

806
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:09,983
Describes to a lot

807
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:12,031
I read an interview with the

808
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:14,335
The guy who put that Fort Knox drives

809
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,103
Cuz he died in

810
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,383
2070

811
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:17,663
Like how

812
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:20,479
Explaining

813
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:22,015
And they're not

814
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:25,087
They're not in favor of what Trump is doing

815
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:25,855
Necessarily

816
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:27,647
Lexus

817
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:28,415
These are not

818
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:32,255
They kind of lead to like this Behavior

819
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:34,303
That's being demonstrated by Trump is a naked

820
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,839
You think it only

821
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:36,607
More

822
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:37,887
Of the crisis

823
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:46,079
Everything believe this entire time is invalidated and

824
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:49,151
180 degrees from what

825
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:51,455
Trump is actually doing and they don't care

826
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:55,039
What would happen if Alex Goes On

827
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:55,807
David choe

828
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:58,367
Is it would you do that

829
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:00,159
Kicked off everything

830
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:01,695
You think so

831
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:03,487
I think it was a slow roll

832
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:06,303
On a

833
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,071
Because David Knight

834
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,607
I don't think he had as much

835
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,655
Sort of traction

836
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:11,679
As much exposure

837
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:13,983
Sounds like that was coming

838
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:15,263
From posting posted on

839
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:17,823
Infowars

840
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:18,591
So when

841
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:19,615
Taking away his

842
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:21,151
Entirely

843
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:23,967
So even if the show is Bill searchable on

844
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:26,783
XYZ I still don't think it matters

845
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,319
You crippled by

846
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:29,087
The same band

847
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:31,391
So I don't know

848
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:34,463
Stealth movie

849
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:37,535
Slowly take over David

850
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:42,911
That's not terrible

851
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:43,935
For the second

852
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:45,215
Kill everybody give me like

853
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:50,079
I mean we got him once let's just ignore him from here on out and then

854
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:56,479
Slow you just like an hour of your show no big deal

855
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:01,087
Fundamental problem is that Alex doesn't want to get on air

856
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:03,135
Good morning that is a big

857
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:04,927
Couldn't get out of bed

858
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:08,511
I agree that the only decision Alex

859
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:10,047
Is made in a long time that I

860
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:13,119
I don't like regular

861
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:16,959
Interview but I forgot there was this one clip that

862
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:17,983
Pretty interesting

863
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:18,751
About David

864
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:28,223
Contest contest but he ended up moving down here from North Carolina

865
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:29,759
When is family

866
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:32,575
Sweltering Texas

867
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:35,903
Orchard

868
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:41,023
Help change the world

869
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:45,887
Anniversary because I've been trying to shut him out and destroying

870
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:51,263
There's no real subscriber

871
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:55,359
He's a Dave Holmes of Infowars

872
00:50:55,615 --> 00:51:01,759
Win the contest and yet he got his own are you telling me that there was a Jesse Camp

873
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:05,087
David Knight in this

874
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:06,623
Metaphor is

875
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:08,927
Mike TV in Willy Wonka

876
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:15,583
No but you know what I think

877
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,399
Lee Ann McAdoo

878
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:23,775
Well I know that you want a contest in order to become an Infowars reporter I know that

879
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:25,823
I really don't like the whole contest at

880
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,103
Captive whether or not you

881
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,663
You should die

882
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:32,991
F****** contest

883
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:36,319
Major what is

884
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:38,367
Play song contest

885
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:40,415
Unreliable

886
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:42,463
Unreliable you're looking for

887
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:45,023
Consistency for predictor of

888
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:51,423
Talent that's not good I don't know if you've ever been to Comedy contest

889
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:56,287
Not necessarily a measurement of quality or skill

890
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:58,847
At Deja Vu in Columbia Missouri

891
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:00,895
Yeah

892
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:02,687
And I lost

893
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:04,735
But I was on

894
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:05,759
There were two

895
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:06,527
Musically

896
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:08,063
Guitar comedy

897
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:09,343
That

898
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:14,207
Naruto was a friend of mine

899
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:15,743
Macadam cuzzo

900
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:19,583
Seem like I was cheating on him

901
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:22,399
But

902
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:31,615
So he wasn't there when the first

903
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:34,175
Guitar Aquanauts know

904
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:36,735
Wasn't entirely guitar but one of the

905
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:37,503
Is Big B

906
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:39,807
Was he would do a cover of Hey There Delilah

907
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:46,207
The other guitar cover

908
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,303
Allegra versus but

909
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:51,327
The chorus was

910
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:53,375
You got some big

911
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:01,567
What's

912
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:13,599
The first guitar Act

913
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:20,767
It wasn't exactly the same

914
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:22,815
Like I said oldroyd showed up

915
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:23,583
After that

916
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,863
No

917
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,399
And none of us who knew him

918
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:32,287
Knew that he was going to do that act until he was walking towards stage with his guitar no

919
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,055
It doesn't

920
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:35,871
Usually goes really well at that club

921
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:39,711
Clubfoot

922
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:42,527
The people who are in The Comedy Room

923
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:44,319
We're just under age

924
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:45,599
People who knew that they could

925
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:50,975
You have to go to the show before the party downstairs

926
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:54,303
Upstairs with comedy clubs

927
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,863
Business is honest

928
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:59,167
It was mostly drunk 18 year old

929
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:00,703
Who are in the audience

930
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:04,543
Look in his face when he gets

931
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:06,847
And doesn't Hey There Delilah cover

932
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:08,383
I think he's getting nothing

933
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:09,151
But confused

934
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:10,431
Looks from the audience

935
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:12,223
It was one of the best days of my life

936
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:19,647
Incredible incredible

937
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:21,439
Incredible story thank you

938
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:28,863
Missouri

939
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:31,167
Do things you can take away from

940
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:35,263
So I'm getting wistful

941
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:36,543
Because David night is come up

942
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:39,615
Hey we got em.

943
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:42,943
Alex Jones

944
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:46,015
With some of my favorite intro music

945
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:49,343
Super misplaced on his show

946
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:10,847
Good morning

947
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:13,151
Goodbye for children

948
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:17,503
Bring up the school

949
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:20,831
And I was exhausted and I was tired

950
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:22,623
Brush my teeth

951
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:24,671
Whiteface

952
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:27,487
Exhausted and I just never looked better

953
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:30,559
I just agree strongly disagree

954
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:31,327
No

955
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:39,519
Great as much as I'd like to

956
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:43,103
Busy look amazing.

957
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:45,663
Yeah

958
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:48,991
You got to stop playing Baltimore

959
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:50,015
That's ridiculous

960
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:54,879
I just want him to play a song and then

961
00:55:56,159 --> 00:56:01,535
With The Highwaymen

962
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:06,143
Completely different song

963
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:13,311
Super gay

964
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:17,663
Lowlife

965
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:22,527
On my own like Tarzan Boy

966
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:28,159
The otter

967
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:30,463
Maybe he's really got some pipes

968
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:34,815
Monkey Business

969
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:39,167
You got to be so great

970
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:45,311
You do like right before the

971
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:46,847
Monkey Business

972
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,223
Jungle life

973
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:54,015
Love this

974
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:55,039
So good

975
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:05,023
So it's been speculated on our Facebook

976
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:06,047
Listen to our show

977
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:07,583
Because we have diamond

978
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:08,351
Commercials

979
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:09,631
Sing along with country music

980
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:12,959
The last episode the things that make us happy

981
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:15,007
Seems like a little bit of a

982
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:17,823
Bright

983
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,615
Everybody quit makes me sick

984
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:23,711
It might be something because the other thing that we really love

985
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:24,991
Is when Alex gets

986
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,271
Esoteric

987
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:28,575
And I think he's doing a little bit of that

988
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:35,999
That's because

989
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:41,119
And I just know I studied history

990
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:53,919
That's not really

991
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:03,135
This is so close to that guy who was on Jim Bakker Show

992
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:05,183
Baker was talking about there was

993
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:12,863
There was Alex about know before World War 1 there was that giant eclipse

994
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:19,775
Just that I like

995
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:20,799
Truly

996
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:30,783
Place where none exist

997
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:33,087
Absolutely

998
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,111
Buttock

999
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:41,023
Middle Country

1000
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:59,455
Thermostat

1001
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:03,551
Call Charlie

1002
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:13,023
Let's be clear

1003
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:14,559
He's talking about coincidence

1004
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:18,143
Describing is

1005
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:24,031
You're looking inside the window and you see for Birds but then for a week

1006
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:25,311
Tina burden

1007
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:26,335
AC for birds

1008
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:28,639
You receive for cars

1009
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:35,039
Get ready for cars going down the road maybe I care about people traveling together what a weird thing

1010
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:36,575
But he doesn't get into message

1011
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:39,135
Stop light

1012
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:40,159
See all those cars

1013
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:41,183
Name of the lights

1014
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:41,951
Turns green

1015
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:44,511
Bless cars go weird

1016
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:47,071
He's not intimate

1017
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:49,119
Traffic pattern

1018
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:55,519
Fluid dynamics

1019
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:58,079
As Above So Below

1020
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:22,143
I just shot up in my chair and I went

1021
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:29,567
With all these World changes going on all these Wars all this is Tik-Tok

1022
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:38,271
Literal planetary alignment

1023
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:52,607
I do have a touch

1024
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:08,223
Maybe some big volcanoes maybe some big stuff taking off

1025
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:10,015
Next few months and I need the bigger

1026
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:15,135
Okay so we got a prediction there

1027
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:21,535
But also Alex kill the guy and of psychic major thing

1028
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:23,071
Story about son

1029
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:27,423
Dreams where you the prophet or whatever the f***

1030
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:33,567
Where you at the goddamn

1031
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:39,967
Cuz you never believe it if it wasn't grounded in the I'm annoyed by my son wanted to take a shower

1032
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:44,063
Either way now I just feel creepy about thinking about us out of the shower now

1033
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:48,159
You've already heard a couple times you talked about like

1034
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:49,695
For kids

1035
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:52,255
He's kind of really ramming home that he has

1036
01:01:57,375 --> 01:02:00,447
I feel like it's kind of like a

1037
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:02,495
People who make fun of them

1038
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:15,039
Dream about the future

1039
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:19,647
I'm not into mystical s*** also I have the touch

1040
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:21,183
What

1041
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:26,815
2 minutes but I should tell you for my entire life I've been able to tell the future

1042
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:32,959
You stuff we did see him say that he had a prophetic dream and stuff yet

1043
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:35,007
Kind of on a level that you can be like

1044
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:39,103
Alright that's a one-off

1045
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:41,407
Some sort of a weird vision

1046
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:51,135
Bin Laden was involved with the original bombing he said he was going to do it again

1047
01:02:57,279 --> 01:03:00,863
Kurt Angle is going to happen

1048
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:02,143
Does not require proper

1049
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:03,679
But

1050
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,215
Alex Jones

1051
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:06,239
Was on Costa

1052
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:07,519
Coast AM last night

1053
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:10,335
Talk about a prophecy

1054
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:12,383
But the other guess

1055
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:14,943
Was talking about

1056
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:20,319
So I think he might have listened to the other gas and it was Dora

1057
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:29,023
I think there might be

1058
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:30,047
It's so jealous

1059
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:33,375
Send Patty and pathetic

1060
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:37,727
Because I

1061
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:41,567
Jungle life

1062
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:44,639
Record a cover of that just as Alex

1063
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:52,063
In Alex's voice

1064
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:54,111
Karaoke track

1065
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:56,927
Coming soon

1066
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:01,023
So

1067
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:03,327
Oh man

1068
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,631
And you put it out there on the Arabic

1069
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:06,655
Party props

1070
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:07,935
Get on Aaron taco

1071
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:11,263
I'm so it leads to

1072
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:12,287
Just say that he has

1073
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:14,335
Jeff he did literally

1074
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:15,359
What is that

1075
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:16,895
What is that

1076
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:18,687
He said he has the touch

1077
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:22,271
Is that like a colloquial thing for

1078
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:23,807
Psychics in the south

1079
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:28,927
You might like it like it has The Shining and it's like

1080
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:32,255
You can see the future so you have the touch which I don't but it's like

1081
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:33,023
Shouldn't be able

1082
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:34,559
Heal people or something like that

1083
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:40,191
He has the ear of the one who has

1084
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:40,959
I've been touched

1085
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:46,847
Oh okay that makes sense

1086
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:49,663
To the lyrics in my head while you're asking

1087
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:51,711
The question of the Shawn Michaels

1088
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:52,735
Entrance music

1089
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:56,831
Sexy boy sexy voice

1090
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:59,391
I got the mood really move them

1091
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:00,159
Haha

1092
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:01,695
Remember if he says he's got the

1093
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:03,231
Touch in there

1094
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:03,999
He's just a sexy

1095
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:07,839
I was thinking of

1096
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:09,631
Touch

1097
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:21,663
That's sad

1098
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:22,431
Robot

1099
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:26,783
Get out of here

1100
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:29,087
From his dream of earthquakes and

1101
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:33,439
Here after he Rambles for another couple minutes

1102
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:36,767
I love this transition

1103
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:44,703
I woke up this morning thinking about earthquakes and volcanoes

1104
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:52,639
This is the big change this is the big deal

1105
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:55,455
Reverse soul-sucker

1106
01:05:56,735 --> 01:06:00,319
We are dealing with spiritual vampire invasion

1107
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:04,415
Slither activate

1108
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:06,207
Monster animal

1109
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:11,327
They are completely

1110
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:13,119
Whatever this you know

1111
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:18,239
What

1112
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:23,871
Yeah that's right

1113
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:27,967
Thank God you're not into Mississippi

1114
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:29,503
Mystical stuff

1115
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:32,063
Whatever out there in space

1116
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:36,671
Demonic soul-sucking vampire

1117
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:39,487
Some Venom shirt is there as you talk about Simeon

1118
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:44,095
I don't know I think that's probably too extreme because that's right

1119
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:47,423
Call that true

1120
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:51,775
Really ghosts for an alien race 22

1121
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:52,543
Because you

1122
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:55,615
That's always been my biggest issue with

1123
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:56,383
Spider-Man,

1124
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:58,687
Too gauche

1125
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:03,807
What about some subtle alien

1126
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:05,087
Deer away from

1127
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:06,367
Reptilian

1128
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:11,999
We are spiritually not far off

1129
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:17,887
It's a shame we're not far off it's that he's literally said

1130
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:23,775
There are things in space demon that attacks themselves

1131
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:26,591
And so on and so forth and it smell like sulfur in all that

1132
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:28,127
Integrate emojis

1133
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:29,663
But I'm not

1134
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:30,943
Symmetrical

1135
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:32,223
And I'm a psychic

1136
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:37,087
That Jesus fights aliens on a regular

1137
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:41,695
You know I can

1138
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:42,975
Now I would read

1139
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:44,255
Graphic novel

1140
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:45,535
I'll tell you that right

1141
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:58,335
Play Jesus come on bukhari

1142
01:07:58,591 --> 01:08:01,663
We we move on here from Alex's corner

1143
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:06,015
Maybe we'll call it now

1144
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:08,575
Little bit

1145
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:11,135
Which is not too surprising

1146
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:12,927
This is really funny

1147
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:16,511
Nubuck

1148
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:24,703
The worst comic ever seen

1149
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:35,711
Another One Bites the Dust

1150
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:56,191
Another One Bites the Dust Alex run like 40 radio station

1151
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:57,727
Jesus

1152
01:08:57,983 --> 01:09:04,127
Something for him to have his Empire intact everything about Michelle wolf show getting canceled because

1153
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:11,039
Position

1154
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:16,927
It's one thing if you are doing well and have that schadenfreude like f*** you all you people who are

1155
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:18,719
Badly

1156
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:23,071
It's so delusional to be like all you guys got your show cancelled

1157
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:25,375
Soda Butte

1158
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:27,935
Show

1159
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:33,311
Fox News you want come on man

1160
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:38,175
Criticize female comedians that don't wind up being

1161
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:41,503
Female comedians are forced upon you god dammit

1162
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:44,831
Women can be just as unfunny as many as

1163
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:51,999
To do with their femininity

1164
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:54,303
I can't do it I can't do that

1165
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:56,607
Dudes

1166
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:57,375
Criticizing

1167
01:09:58,655 --> 01:09:59,679
It's not fun

1168
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:03,007
And if you throw a female in there

1169
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:09,407
Oh no that's

1170
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:15,807
Now we got to we got to leave

1171
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:21,439
He's gloating about them getting their shows

1172
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:22,463
Cancel

1173
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:25,535
He doesn't have a show and never will

1174
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:28,607
Reminds me of Allah

1175
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:30,399
Brother Ali

1176
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:32,703
30 did with idea

1177
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:36,543
Okay fun of him for like how many tapes

1178
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:37,823
Sold

1179
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:40,895
And I'll brother all these response to it in the battle was

1180
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:41,919
You talk about my

1181
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:47,551
You're talkin about their shows at least they had

1182
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:52,671
Except

1183
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:53,951
Fox News would not

1184
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:56,511
Defending Alec

1185
01:10:57,279 --> 01:10:59,071
Never have him on

1186
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:03,679
Which maybe in a week I'll have to walk back when he hasn't really possible

1187
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:07,775
Why not have him on his again

1188
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:10,591
Wouldn't that be the logical thing to do but no

1189
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:18,271
No program no Fox News programming director

1190
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:19,807
Is going to be like Hey listen

1191
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:21,087
We agree with you

1192
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:22,879
We're f****** racist to s*** to

1193
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:23,647
But

1194
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:24,927
No we can't do this

1195
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:28,255
But you're a pro

1196
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:33,631
For years man

1197
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:40,799
And you were capable of evolving to the point where you no longer wear a bow tie Alex's

1198
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:46,687
The shittiest bowtie vault

1199
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:48,223
Maybe

1200
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:50,527
They invited Alex on

1201
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:51,551
But they were like

1202
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:55,135
You got to say that f****** beard it's terrible no awful

1203
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:59,999
If you want to go on TV ever shave the beard

1204
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:01,791
Turn them down he would never stop.

1205
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:03,327
I know that

1206
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:06,655
You're right

1207
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:07,935
Betty White

1208
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:09,471
Get back to Soros

1209
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:13,055
Interesting about him

1210
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:17,407
Actually really fun

1211
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:19,967
Get to

1212
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:21,503

George Soros loxism

1214
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:38,143
Double x's in your eyes

1215
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:42,751
The man

1216
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:56,831
Believes he is Jesus Christ

1217
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:07,327
63rd Avenue

1218
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:11,423
Demon son what I still think about you and your family

1219
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:14,751
It's still groceries trying to do some ASMR there at the end

1220
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:16,287
That's f***** up

1221
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:24,223
You are very

1222
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:24,991
Relaxed

1223
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:34,463
Crinkly crinkly crinkly

1224
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:43,679
ASMR

1225
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:44,959
It would be

1226
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:45,727
F*****'-a

1227
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:47,263
ASMR Alec

1228
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:50,335
Loyola

1229
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:52,383
The world

1230
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:56,991
When is the global

1231
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:01,343
El relax

1232
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:04,671
And they put him on a table

1233
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:05,951
And they roll their hair

1234
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:07,743
Smaller tables

1235
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:09,023
And they put their parents

1236
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:13,375
Turn the tables made out of their hands and I a bad at 8

1237
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:17,215
Words I want me to say

1238
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:20,031
Poppycock

1239
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:21,055
Krugerrand

1240
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:23,615
Succotash

1241
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:37,951
Bouillabaisse

1242
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:40,255
That's a very delicious cold soup

1243
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:41,023
Bouillabaisse

1244
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:45,119
The best

1245
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:46,143
Videos now

1246
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:51,263
Books and stuff over the years has said that he believes himself to be

1247
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:52,031
Christ which is

1248
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:53,567
Accurate

1249
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:54,847
This is a misrepresentation of

1250
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:56,127
Quote from his book The

1251
01:14:56,383 --> 01:14:56,895
Premier Finance

1252
01:14:58,175 --> 01:14:59,711
I admit that I've always harbored in

1253
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:01,759
Exaggerated view of myself important

1254
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:03,039
Bluntly

1255
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:03,807
Myself

1256
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:05,855
Some kind of God or economic reformer like

1257
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:06,623
IQ

1258
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:10,719
Eat with his general theory or even better a scientist like

1259
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:13,791
Are you talkin about the delusions

1260
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:15,839
You talkin about the selfie

1261
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:19,423
Importance that he felt that has been corrected

1262
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:20,703
Maturing

1263
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:21,983
Becoming older

1264
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:24,799
There's a further quote from his book underwriting democracy

1265
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:31,711
Ixora it goes like this

1266
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:33,247
I carried some rather potent message

1267
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:35,039
From childhood

1268
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:38,111
The control otherwise I might end up in the loony

1269
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:40,415
But when I made my way to the world I wanted to

1270
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:41,951
Indulge Myself and I

1271
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:42,975
The extent that I could

1272
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:43,743
Ford

1273
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:45,279
That is

1274
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:49,631
Selected

1275
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:52,959
The larger context of the quote where it comes from

1276
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:54,239
From the text put it into

1277
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:59,615
I began my work directed at opening up close societies about 10 years

1278
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:01,663
I wasn't successful manager of an inch

1279
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:02,943
International address

1280
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:05,247
And I was making more money that I had used

1281
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:07,551
I began to think about what I should do with it

1282
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:08,831
The idea of setting

1283
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:09,855
Foundation

1284
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:11,391
Maybe cuz I had always felt that one

1285
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:12,159
To do something

1286
01:16:12,415 --> 01:16:13,439
For other people if one could

1287
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:15,231
I was confirmed

1288
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:16,767
But I considered

1289
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:20,351
Narrow base for my rather inflated cell

1290
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:23,167
Right if truth be known I carry some rather potent Messi on

1291
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:24,703
From childhood

1292
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:27,263
Control otherwise they might get

1293
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:31,615
The trouble but when I had my way in the world I wanted

1294
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:33,151
Santa could afford

1295
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:34,687
Messianic fantasies

1296
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:35,967
Has he had

1297
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:37,247
Just got to come from the factory

1298
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:38,271
Did he survive the Holocaust

1299
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:39,807
And the way he wanted to

1300
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:40,575
To indulge

1301
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:43,391
Is that he wanted to set up ways to help promote

1302
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:44,159
Free Society

1303
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:45,183
Another quote

1304
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:46,463
From that same book

1305
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:48,255
I realized I cared passion

1306
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:50,303
Lie about the concept of an open Society

1307
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:51,583
Which people like me

1308
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:52,863
Could enjoy freedom without being

1309
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:53,887
Hounded to death

1310
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:56,191
Accordingly I called my Foundation the open

1311
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:56,959
Society

1312
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:59,775
With the objective of making open societies viable

1313
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:00,799
Helping to open up

1314
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:01,567
Close the

1315
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:07,711
Massive

1316
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:08,991
Depilator

1317
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:10,015
Survivors

1318
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:13,599
Channel that somehow instead

1319
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:15,135
Into almost a

1320
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:18,207
The only reason I could have survived

1321
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:19,231
Is because

1322
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:21,535
Is because I have some

1323
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:28,703
Which is a witch

1324
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:31,007
Very understandable

1325
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:32,031
In the circumstances

1326
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:35,103
And all the other context

1327
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:36,639
Of his heroic father

1328
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:38,175
Who wrote The Shining

1329
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:42,271
Examples for real hero

1330
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:46,111
Understandable

1331
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:49,183
I'm bullet

1332
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:53,791
Sort of that goes away with time

1333
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:54,815
And that is what

1334
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:55,839
Does

1335
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:58,143
If you look at them and

1336
01:17:58,911 --> 01:17:59,935
Not today that he's a

1337
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:02,239
But all of these things

1338
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:03,263
Did they use to

1339
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:04,543
Attack him

1340
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:05,823
Aldi

1341
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:06,847
There are

1342
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:08,127
Reasonable critique

1343
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:09,663
You could make and they

1344
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:10,687
Some reason

1345
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:11,455
Not sure why

1346
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:12,735
The only

1347
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:15,551
I don't know why that it

1348
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:17,087
Very curious

1349
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:20,159
I can't think of any reason

1350
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:22,463
For me it's because they're lazy

1351
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:24,255
For me I mean like

1352
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:25,791
It's just the idea of being

1353
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:26,815
Billionaire

1354
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:28,863
Regardless of how philanthropic

1355
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:31,423
You may be right

1356
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:34,239
So we can just talk about billionaires but if you

1357
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:35,007
You start talking

1358
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:36,031
About billionaire

1359
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:37,823
You got to start talking about

1360
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:42,431
It's always like if you apply some sort of

1361
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:43,199
Standard

1362
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:46,271
Did your team as well

1363
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:49,599
So they pick one

1364
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:51,391
Fake standard

1365
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:55,487
It's so far

1366
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:56,255
Because like Alex

1367
01:18:56,511 --> 01:18:57,023
Throw around

1368
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:58,047
Beside these study

1369
01:18:58,559 --> 01:19:00,095
I'm done about how like

1370
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:00,863
Most Billy

1371
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:03,679
Democratic candidates

1372
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:04,959
And that he's actually Act

1373
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:08,287
Sing but every study

1374
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:10,079
You actually get into like the

1375
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:12,383
Going to saying like

1376
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:14,431
A lot of people on the right

1377
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:15,199
Donate

1378
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:17,247
Like hidden fun

1379
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:19,551
Stuff like that like a donor fund

1380
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:22,623
Stuff like that

1381
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:23,391
Even in the

1382
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:24,671
The studies themselves

1383
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:31,071
They have like we have no idea who's giving money we're crazy

1384
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:32,095
That donors

1385
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:34,399
Who donate large amounts of money to

1386
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:35,679
To the Democratic party

1387
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:37,727
Interested in

1388
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:44,127
Read the rest of the world people who donate to the Republican Party

1389
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:47,711
To be in public

1390
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:50,015
So

1391
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:51,039
It doesn't really prove

1392
01:19:57,695 --> 01:19:58,975
There's a f****** Chase Bank

1393
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:00,255
People

1394
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:04,351
Feeling a little better

1395
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:05,887
No more billionaires

1396
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:07,423
I mean

1397
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:08,447
More Lisa

1398
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:10,239
So

1399
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:11,263
Next clip

1400
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:15,360
I don't know any other way

1401
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:16,384
To tell you

1402
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:17,664
This is great

1403
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:19,456
So you start by getting it

1404
01:20:19,712 --> 01:20:20,992
His beams about like how he

1405
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:22,016
Going to get blamed

1406
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:24,064
Media fall swags themselves

1407
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:24,832
Which is fun

1408
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:28,928
Nobody

1409
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:29,696
You could predict

1410
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:30,720
It's so great

1411
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:38,912
The Washington Post

1412
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:50,688
Remember that that's already happened he was going to come kill everybody and then got arrested

1413
01:20:58,368 --> 01:21:00,160
Books-A-Million

1414
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:07,072
Talk about Oklahoma City

1415
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:28,832
Also the McRib is coming

1416
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:32,160
Coronavirus

1417
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:43,936
A fancy dining car

1418
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:45,728
They're probably drinking coffee

1419
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:47,776
And smoking big cigars

1420
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:51,616
You know I knew I had to come and I knew I can't be free

1421
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:54,688
Keep the blowing and that's what

1422
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:55,712
Tortures me

1423
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:03,904
Why was just the baby mama told me son always be

1424
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:07,232
But I shot a man in Reno

1425
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:18,496
Oh my goodness I haven't gotten to yet

1426
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:22,336
Hey There Delilah

1427
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:28,736
I don't know if it's a great idea

1428
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:38,720
Making a connection that the no one else could possibly

1429
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:39,744
Ablative

1430
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:44,096
When he says he killed the guy and then he starts talking about killing a guy in the

1431
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:50,496
Killing a guy

1432
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:51,520
Conspiracy theories

1433
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:54,848
It's just weird false flagging yourself

1434
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:58,944
I don't know I don't know that there's any like real connection and Lord knows we

1435
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,224
We can never know what goes on in

1436
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:01,248
The minds of weirdos

1437
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:03,552
But like dude

1438
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:06,880
Out of nowhere

1439
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:07,904
Reciting

1440
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:09,184
Dramatically

1441
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:10,464
Like most

1442
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:12,256
Lyrics to Folsom Prison Blues

1443
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:13,024
When

1444
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:15,072
Very an hour-and-a-half

1445
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:16,352
Earlier you said

1446
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:18,144
I never killed anybody

1447
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:19,680
Technically

1448
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:22,496
Technically technically

1449
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:23,776
That's f***** up

1450
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:30,176
This is super f*****-up weird episode

1451
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:35,040
Woodmore outside

1452
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:36,320
He's now back to the point where you

1453
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:39,904
F****** doesn't

1454
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:42,720
You confessed to murder disrespect

1455
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:51,680
I don't think it'll get us

1456
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:52,704
The million dollars

1457
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:56,800
Maybe a piece of

1458
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:59,616
Is my argument that Alex's advocating violence

1459
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:08,320
But

1460
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:16,768
A just coming up for our families and everybody else future everything but very very

1461
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:17,792
Firm

1462
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:19,840
No pleasure

1463
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:22,912
And the fact that defend ourselves

1464
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:26,752
Pleasure

1465
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:37,248
I want to call man cockroach I don't want to have a bunch of stuff

1466
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:39,040
I'll come here buddy

1467
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:41,344
Just crush your head

1468
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:43,136
Trash can

1469
01:24:44,928 --> 01:24:45,696
Killing cockroaches

1470
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:50,816
Add

1471
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:54,144
I would never offensive

1472
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:00,544
You know there's a rich tradition of

1473
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,080
Calling your enemies cockroach

1474
01:25:02,336 --> 01:25:03,360
What

1475
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:04,896
I think that he's

1476
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:05,920
I think that he saying

1477
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:07,200
You such a good guy

1478
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:11,552
Enjoy it

1479
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:16,416
Think about it really

1480
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:21,024
Is it does he think that's in the plus column does he think that's in a pro like hey

1481
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:23,584
I would enjoy murdering

1482
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:25,120
Only dogs

1483
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:29,472
Really liked it

1484
01:25:29,728 --> 01:25:31,264
I don't know man

1485
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:33,824
Time yeah you know we all we all have

1486
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:39,456
Get-rich-quick moment killing a guy

1487
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:44,064
Having that ate shot who knows

1488
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:52,512
Cowardly

1489
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:59,168
Who sings No it's not even that

1490
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:01,472
It's not even that it's saying that

1491
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:03,520
Suggested

1492
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:05,056
That these people are

1493
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:08,640
Solo and so evil that my first preference is

1494
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:09,664
To save them

1495
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:11,712
But because they have gone so far

1496
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:13,504
I have no choice

1497
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:19,904
But you stopped them underneath my boot not only are you now Justified

1498
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:20,672
Murdering them

1499
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:22,976
But not only that you can then

1500
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:26,048
Feel like you're taking the moral High Ground

1501
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:28,352
For not enjoying

1502
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:30,144
Feeling this one

1503
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:31,936
As opposed to

1504
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:34,496
Something that you Delight in like the f******

1505
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:40,896
Psychopath you are cockroaches

1506
01:26:41,152 --> 01:26:42,944
We heard earlier him saying thesaurus

1507
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:43,968
Thanks you're an animal

1508
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:46,784
The only people I ever

1509
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:51,648
Weird that's pretty that

1510
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:52,928
Dehumanizer

1511
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:59,328
People calling Omarosa a dog don't worry about everyone

1512
01:26:59,584 --> 01:27:00,096
Hilarious

1513
01:27:00,352 --> 01:27:01,376
If Alex call her.

1514
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:04,448
September's other dogs

1515
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:05,984
Islamqa too good

1516
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:08,032
Is to feel real bad for that

1517
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:09,312
Forgot

1518
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:15,968
Did the cross

1519
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:19,040
Live clip with couch

1520
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:21,344
Defensive

1521
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:24,672
That's how we get away with all this

1522
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:26,720
Image next clip

1523
01:27:27,232 --> 01:27:28,256
What do you talkin about

1524
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:29,280
I don't know how

1525
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:30,816
Someone could hear this

1526
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:32,096
Not respond

1527
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:33,120
Thinking about like

1528
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:34,400
F****** killed

1529
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,848
So I'm not sitting here sleeping about Rockabye my bed

1530
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:45,920
First of all

1531
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:47,968
I'm going to stop there to say

1532
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:50,272
Complains about celebrities having armed guards

1533
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:52,320
Security I don't have a

1534
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:53,600
Battle rifle

1535
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:57,440
But not like it

1536
01:27:57,696 --> 01:27:58,208
P**** way

1537
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:07,680
The left

1538
01:28:15,104 --> 01:28:15,872
If you do not

1539
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:19,712
Open your chest and Neil

1540
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:21,248
You are a terrorist

1541
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:24,832
God

1542
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,160
Defeated me

1543
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:37,376
And then Jack Dorsey

1544
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:52,992
Bible

1545
01:28:57,856 --> 01:28:58,880
Empathic

1546
01:28:59,392 --> 01:29:01,952
Zara's best

1547
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:02,720
No

1548
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:17,312
I just heard you say fake laugh while laughing while he hasn't felt

1549
01:29:25,248 --> 01:29:26,784
The people

1550
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:30,368
That's gross

1551
01:29:30,624 --> 01:29:32,160
Message Judy started putting out there is that

1552
01:29:32,672 --> 01:29:33,440
These items that we

1553
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:34,208
We have this

1554
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:36,000
Vision of a

1555
01:29:36,256 --> 01:29:36,768
Be afraid of

1556
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:39,328
They just want you to submit to them

1557
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:42,400
Greatest crime ever but

1558
01:29:42,656 --> 01:29:44,448
If you submit to them then they're going to kill you anyway

1559
01:29:46,752 --> 01:29:49,824
That he's putting out that is with these people no matter what you do they're trying

1560
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:50,592
Need to kill you

1561
01:29:50,848 --> 01:29:52,384
That is the truth

1562
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:53,408
It logically

1563
01:29:53,664 --> 01:29:54,176
Follows that you

1564
01:29:54,944 --> 01:29:55,456
Kill them

1565
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:59,296
But I know that he's not saying kill these people or anything like that

1566
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:00,064
Martin

1567
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,088
Nothing I do that

1568
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:01,856
Most of the time

1569
01:30:03,392 --> 01:30:04,416
That is the message

1570
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:07,232
It's important that like I know that

1571
01:30:07,744 --> 01:30:08,256
Can't hold him

1572
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:10,304
Responsible for what people hear

1573
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:11,584
Because of the way our laws work

1574
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,632
Sure people are in on the side

1575
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:15,168
Which

1576
01:30:15,424 --> 01:30:16,960
Support but it's ludicrous

1577
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:19,008
To say that he's not advocating

1578
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:21,056
It's absurd

1579
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:23,616
It's not legally actionable but that is what he's doing

1580
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:27,968
Deuteronomy

1581
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:36,416
Dude is one of those Commandments o

1582
01:30:36,672 --> 01:30:41,280
Deuteronomy is the one that's all obsessed with

1583
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:43,328
With laws and those f****** a******

1584
01:30:57,664 --> 01:30:58,944
Personally

1585
01:30:59,712 --> 01:31:05,344
I just believe that the Bible is a living true document and everything in it is literally true

1586
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:09,440
Yes sure the Bible says

1587
01:31:09,696 --> 01:31:10,208
We killed

1588
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:11,488
Want to do it

1589
01:31:11,744 --> 01:31:17,888
But

1590
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:23,264
Absolutely it's a weird like cowardly

1591
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:25,568
No I love

1592
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:28,384
God

1593
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:31,712
Right

1594
01:31:31,968 --> 01:31:34,272
To go against the word of God

1595
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:36,064
What what am I some guy

1596
01:31:39,136 --> 01:31:41,952
Didn't he just give a perfect defensive why we should

1597
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:44,512
Rise up and overthrow our billionaire overlords

1598
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,048
Walk me through that

1599
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:49,376
Is that

1600
01:31:49,888 --> 01:31:50,656
Of course

1601
01:31:51,168 --> 01:31:57,056
The only thing that they hate more than submission is refusing to submit and they're going to kill you anyway

1602
01:31:57,568 --> 01:31:58,848
Is that your only option that is

1603
01:32:00,128 --> 01:32:05,248
Right so what is what is our billionaire Overlord class other than somebody who is

1604
01:32:05,504 --> 01:32:07,040
Stamping on all of our f******

1605
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:09,344
Throat coming to our goddamn home

1606
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:12,160
If you borrow the rhetoric

1607
01:32:12,416 --> 01:32:13,440
Answer to tweak it a little

1608
01:32:13,696 --> 01:32:19,840
Yeah just like the logical

1609
01:32:24,704 --> 01:32:25,728
Chase Bank

1610
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:27,008
Steal my bread

1611
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:31,616
Came to your house more like

1612
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:34,432
They had five guys stamp on your throat

1613
01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:36,736
Steal $35 from you

1614
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:42,624
And then they f****** put it in your mouth and said deal with it

1615
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:44,928
And I said

1616
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:45,696
Hooray

1617
01:32:47,488 --> 01:32:48,512
Did you do a British accent

1618
01:32:52,096 --> 01:32:52,864
I don't do good

1619
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:53,888
British accents

1620
01:32:54,912 --> 01:32:55,424
Corky

1621
01:32:57,472 --> 01:32:59,008
That's a good one thank you

1622
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:18,208
In this next clip we only got a couple left here

1623
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,792
It was not the result of

1624
01:33:22,048 --> 01:33:22,816
Ifun

1625
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:25,120
But I wanted to keep this in

1626
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:26,912
Because he that we heard and are out of

1627
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:31,520
Contacts drop a really angry sales paper

1628
01:33:31,776 --> 01:33:34,848
This is how sort of

1629
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:38,176
This is just an indication of how all over the place

1630
01:33:38,432 --> 01:33:38,944

You know

1641
01:34:31,424 --> 01:34:34,752
I don't trust that the sales pitch of like we have great everything like

1642
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:40,128
Never ever ever suggest

1643
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:41,152
That we have

1644
01:34:41,664 --> 01:34:43,456
Great like every one of our episodes

1645
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:50,368
I'm just saying like

1646
01:34:50,624 --> 01:34:51,136
Baker episode

1647
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:57,536
That doesn't mean that

1648
01:35:01,376 --> 01:35:05,984
Think about your own decisions in your own life and what you want to do and maybe you'll like it maybe you won't

1649
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:07,008
It's fine

1650
01:35:07,264 --> 01:35:08,288
Let's Roll

1651
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:12,128
Maybe that's why I'm a bad salesman

1652
01:35:14,688 --> 01:35:16,736
Talk you back a little bit

The salesperson was trying to not get a sale

1656
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:36,960
I get it why you don't not

1657
01:35:37,216 --> 01:35:39,520
Spicy

1658
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:44,384
You know like last night I went out and got some friends

1659
01:35:46,432 --> 01:35:48,736
I had to wrestle with like the ideas

1660
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:49,760
Hey

1661
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:52,064
You want one of these carrots

1662
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:53,344
And like

1663
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:56,928
I had to I had to roll with the idea that like I love really spicy

1664
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:58,720
Stop but not everybody does

1665
01:35:59,232 --> 01:36:01,792
Right when I was trying to get you to eat one of my Thai peppers

1666
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:03,328
But I had that I've grown

1667
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:05,376
Man like it's just rude of me

1668
01:36:05,632 --> 01:36:06,144
Expect you

1669
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:07,168
Enjoy that

1670
01:36:07,936 --> 01:36:08,448

Yeah one more clip hair Jordan

I told you the reason that I K

1675
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:27,904
Came back to the present saying

1676
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:30,976
Decided to stick around here for a little while

1677
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:32,256
Alex's approached

1678
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:33,792

Because the manafort's stuff hasn't broken yet

1685
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:48,640
By the time

1686
01:36:49,152 --> 01:36:50,944
Takes over

1687
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:56,320

01:38:21,824 --> 01:38:23,104
Display

1704
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:34,112
ABC and CNN reporter that have an ugly baby

1705
01:38:36,672 --> 01:38:39,744
Nothing nothing

1706
01:38:40,256 --> 01:38:44,096
What are you going to take a little you got like in that moment

1707
01:38:45,376 --> 01:38:46,144
What is it going to

1708
01:38:47,168 --> 01:38:50,496
Who are on fire like

1709
01:38:50,752 --> 01:38:51,776
Alright I get there

1710
01:38:52,544 --> 01:38:53,568
I don't know I think

1711
01:38:55,616 --> 01:38:56,384
You know it

1712
01:38:57,152 --> 01:38:57,664
Extra

1713
01:38:58,176 --> 01:38:58,944
I have no idea what

1714
01:38:59,712 --> 01:39:01,248
Apparently it was bombing

1715
01:39:04,832 --> 01:39:05,344
Killed

1716
01:39:08,672 --> 01:39:09,184
You know

1717
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:13,024
We can talk all day about the

1718
01:39:13,536 --> 01:39:14,304
Alex

1719
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:15,328
Who is the famous

1720
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:16,608
Shoves Isis

1721
01:39:18,656 --> 01:39:20,448
He's now getting

1722
01:39:20,704 --> 01:39:23,264
Michael Cohen

1723
01:39:23,776 --> 01:39:25,312
Certainly

1724
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:27,360
Sort of

1725
01:39:27,616 --> 01:39:29,664
Point on that and I think it's a fair assumption to

1726
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:31,968
Is that Alex has kind of buzzed

1727
01:39:33,504 --> 01:39:34,272
You did all that stuff

1728
01:39:34,528 --> 01:39:35,040
Rodger talk

1729
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:37,088
Reasonable the song

1730
01:39:38,624 --> 01:39:39,904
Equally reasonable to assume

1731
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:41,696
Because of the way that Alex

1732
01:39:44,256 --> 01:39:45,280
Who got killed in the bombing

1733
01:39:45,536 --> 01:39:46,816
Cuz that's the assumption that he was

1734
01:39:47,072 --> 01:39:47,584
I was making

1735
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:49,888
And then the next day when he found out there was any Rush

1736
01:39:51,936 --> 01:39:52,704
So I think it's

1737
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:54,752
Equally plausible that what it will take

1738
01:39:55,008 --> 01:39:55,520
For him to

1739
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:57,824
Is Trump actually attack

1740
01:39:58,592 --> 01:39:59,872
Or Trump turning on

1741
01:40:00,384 --> 01:40:01,152
Yeah I don't

1742
01:40:01,408 --> 01:40:02,432
Mean that to say that Alex

1743
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:04,224
Russia or anything like

1744
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:06,272
But the last time

1745
01:40:07,296 --> 01:40:08,832
Cortical turn on Trump

1746
01:40:09,088 --> 01:40:10,112
Most of his motivation

1747
01:40:11,136 --> 01:40:12,160
He killed a bunch of Russia

1748
01:40:12,416 --> 01:40:13,440
Soldiers

1749
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:15,488
So I don't know

1750
01:40:17,024 --> 01:40:17,536
I don't know man

1751
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:19,072
It's it's

1752
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:23,168
Maybe maybe

1753
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:25,472
Could turn on Ezra

1754
01:40:26,752 --> 01:40:27,520
I'm not sure this

1755
01:40:28,032 --> 01:40:32,896
I don't know if turning on Israel would even look like

1756
01:40:35,968 --> 01:40:37,504
Like what

1757
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:45,184
Support you expanding your settlements illegally into the place where your illegal he's expanding your exhaust

1758
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:45,952
Your settlement

1759
01:40:47,488 --> 01:40:49,536
What you just do another the right

1760
01:40:50,048 --> 01:40:54,912
Because Riley said other its capital will now be in Boca Raton

1761
01:40:55,936 --> 01:41:01,312
Wanted closed tomorrow Lago Israel is a

1762
01:41:01,824 --> 01:41:02,592
Come on over

1763
01:41:03,104 --> 01:41:05,920
What's your Holy Land

1764
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:08,224
Brigiotta's nothing

1765
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:12,832
It sucks because the joke I was trying to make was about the idea that that's closed tomorrow Lago

1766
01:41:15,392 --> 01:41:19,232
It's pretty close to Vacation sort of fun place

1767
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:26,912
Florida

1768
01:41:33,568 --> 01:41:35,104
Out of where

1769
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:37,408
It would just make sense to move up

1770
01:41:39,968 --> 01:41:40,736
It's Florida

1771
01:41:40,992 --> 01:41:44,320
North Carolina

1772
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:45,856
It's funny that

1773
01:41:46,624 --> 01:41:47,392
Trump wants to

1774
01:41:48,416 --> 01:41:49,184
Drain the swamp

1775
01:41:50,464 --> 01:41:51,488
Places very close to

1776
01:41:53,792 --> 01:41:54,304
Here

1777
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:57,888
That's my big boy abandon hope all ye who enter

1778
01:42:00,192 --> 01:42:00,704
Tell you what

1779
01:42:01,216 --> 01:42:01,728
Jordan

1780
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:03,520
You come to the end of this episode

1781
01:42:03,776 --> 01:42:04,288
Yeah

1782
01:42:05,568 --> 01:42:06,080
Doozy

1783
01:42:06,592 --> 01:42:08,640
Here just to put a button on that last clip

1784
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:10,176
Most of the

1785
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:15,808
It's really funny to hear him make that sort of thing before it comes out

1786
01:42:16,064 --> 01:42:16,576
Bettencourt

1787
01:42:16,832 --> 01:42:18,112
Kid said that

1788
01:42:18,368 --> 01:42:18,880
He was working

1789
01:42:21,952 --> 01:42:22,464
Candid

1790
01:42:22,976 --> 01:42:25,024
Candidate candidate for president

1791
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:26,560
There were Evan Hillary

1792
01:42:26,816 --> 01:42:28,096
There were at least four

1793
01:42:28,864 --> 01:42:34,496
Everybody knows Hillary would have loved nothing more than for Cohen to have paid off

1794
01:42:36,032 --> 01:42:38,848
And avoided.

1795
01:42:39,104 --> 01:42:40,640
Story that makes sense

1796
01:42:42,432 --> 01:42:43,200
Gary Johnson

1797
01:42:46,272 --> 01:42:47,296
He's The Mastermind

1798
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:51,136
I think we will know very short

1799
01:42:51,392 --> 01:42:54,464
We already have no bread

1800
01:42:55,232 --> 01:42:58,304
Episode

1801
01:42:58,560 --> 01:42:59,584
Still in the show sucks

1802
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:01,888
And most of the show that's

1803
01:43:02,144 --> 01:43:02,656
Just repetition

1804
01:43:02,912 --> 01:43:03,680
And yelling about China

1805
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:07,008
Alex probably killed a guy

1806
01:43:07,264 --> 01:43:12,128
No probably

1807
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:14,688
Play kill the guy

1808
01:43:14,944 --> 01:43:17,760
Murder murder him

1809
01:43:18,016 --> 01:43:19,552
Did technically kill a guy

1810
01:43:19,808 --> 01:43:20,832
It seems that way

1811
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:21,856
Probably check

1812
01:43:22,112 --> 01:43:23,648
Technically

1813
01:43:23,904 --> 01:43:24,672
He killed a guy

1814
01:43:24,928 --> 01:43:26,976
So now you not understand fully why we had to do

1815
01:43:27,232 --> 01:43:32,096
This is very important to our investigation

1816
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:44,640
Oh

1817
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:50,528
Unforeseen

1818
01:43:52,064 --> 01:43:52,576
With a bigger batch

1819
01:43:53,088 --> 01:43:55,648
Nope

1820
01:43:58,976 --> 01:44:00,768
What to know

1821
01:44:06,144 --> 01:44:07,424
Got to get a shirt

1822
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:13,824
Integrity cell

1823
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:16,128
In the Albert

1824
01:44:16,384 --> 01:44:17,152
Look

1825
01:44:17,408 --> 01:44:19,968
Call Larry nickel shirt

1826
01:44:20,224 --> 01:44:24,576
Which does not exist and probably never will

1827
01:44:24,832 --> 01:44:27,904
Is just esoteric nonsense

1828
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:30,464
Baseball

1829
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,280
Piscina

1830
01:44:36,608 --> 01:44:37,376
Kind of

1831
01:44:37,632 --> 01:44:39,936
To the rhythm of

1832
01:44:45,312 --> 01:44:47,872
Alex killed a guy

1833
01:44:58,368 --> 01:44:58,880
The f*** themselves

1834
01:44:59,136 --> 01:45:00,416
Cuz I think that's gotten a little stale

1835
01:45:00,672 --> 01:45:01,184
Right

1836
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:07,584
We end every episode by reminding the audience analysis killing guy

1837
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:08,864
That maybe

1838
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:10,144
I guess it's your turn

1839
01:45:10,656 --> 01:45:14,496
Website knowledge buy.com

1840
01:45:14,752 --> 01:45:19,872
Analogous

1841
01:45:23,712 --> 01:45:25,248
You can find it find out

1842
01:45:25,504 --> 01:45:26,272
Nope music

1843
01:45:26,528 --> 01:45:32,672
PW of fun here and but just end things are very serious note we need to remind you

1844
01:45:33,184 --> 01:45:36,000
Did Alex Jones killed a guy

1845
01:45:40,608 --> 01:45:44,192
Alexandra Thurston color
