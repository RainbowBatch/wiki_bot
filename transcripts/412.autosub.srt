00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:21,248
Jordan

00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I have great respect for knowledge by knowledge I'm sick of them posing as you're through the good guy

3
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:34,048
We are the bad guys

4
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
MoneyGram

5
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:59,136

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,168
Right spot this been going on

11
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:16,544
This is going to be an iffy Brightspot

12
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:23,712
New Bright but it's also a little bit weird OK Google

13
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:29,856
About the time that the WWF put out an album or rappers did

14
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:33,184
The wrestler theme song rap version

15
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,024
I've listened to that in a long time so I can listen to it

16
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:39,840
That great but I started to think about other

17
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:46,496
Stuff that I haven't heard him here's the 69 Boyz

18
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:47,520
Do you remember this

19
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,312
69 Boyz I do not remember this

20
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:52,128
69 Boyz when I was in high school will you drive to lunch

21
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:55,200
And everybody liked that one way 69

22
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:57,504
The guy who drove us to lunch

23
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:03,904
I had an album called the wait is over by the 69 Boyz song on it called

24
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,768
Down to the base freaky down to the album play a little sample of it here it's so far down

25
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:20,800
You represent McDonald's

26
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:32,576
Free movie

27
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:39,744
Listen here's the problem you were talking over the part that's the most awesome about this I apologize

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,816
I see he's as a man ever made you buckle up at your knees

29
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:49,472
By the way you slowly ate your macaroni and cheese

30
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,752
This song is

31
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:53,056
Full of food metaphors

32
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:59,456
Everything is just about f****** but he's talking about like I'm going to drop my ham hocks in your mustard greens

33
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:04,064
Ridiculous until I listen to it was like that's just as fun as I remember it

34
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,624
Configure really ridiculous

35
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:07,904
Song

36
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:12,768
And then I realize that that came out in 1998 blue boy that's

37
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,560
22 years old

38
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:17,632
Years into Clinton's presidency

39
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:24,288
That's like when I was born that amount of time back would have been 1966

40
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:30,432
So what I was bored like the Beatles were putting out albums if he

41
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:35,552
It's been said to 69.

42
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,576
Prequel

43
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,880
The Beatles in the 69 Equinox

44
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,160
In time

45
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:40,928
Something like that

46
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,792
What about you I will tell you this if you ever heard of awesome games done

47
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:52,192

Speed Run video game

49
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:56,800
Blind speed race

50
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,080
Super Mario maker

51
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:01,408
And watching these guys just slowly

52
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,944
Figure out how to get through this imp

53
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,016
Ausable Mario level is so

54
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:12,416
It's so fun to watch them learn and their little techniques get better each and every time at all so it's just mesmerizing

55
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,232
Everything moves around there

56
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,000
Jumping off a

57
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:16,768
The wall

58
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,559
It's very very fun and soothing

59
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,839

00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:22,399

Not only the real world but in the world of Alex's narrative

75
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:56,959

The show I like sports

109
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:47,807
Bunzel's Workshop would appreciate it but also if you're feeling so inclined to spend some money

110
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:53,183
Perhaps I consider donating to charity in your area that supports people who are

111
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,743
Laid off service industry workers

112
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:59,839

Excuse me stuff like that there

115
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,471
I'm probably are more severe.

116
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,751
Vanoss although

117
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,031
We do certainly appreciate

118
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,079
Organize your friends in

00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:19,039
Alright then you can find more information about this by going to number 12 Cheesecake Factory and number two

122
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:19,807
To Jordan Square

123
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,575
That sounds like

124
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:24,415
So Jordan like I said today we have a very bizarre

125
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,951
Situation on Alex

126
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,999
The show and it starts

127
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,023
With him promising

128
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,071
To be right on the ball today

129
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,863
Alright right down the middle

130
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,143
Going to be good then

131
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,191
This time I believe it

132
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:36,959
Going to do a good job

133
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:43,103
But I'm going to be a really good boy today and I'm going to cover all the news and boy is it

134
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:43,871
Amazing

135
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:51,039
Billion-pound enchilada the sitting in the middle of the living room

136
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,879
I like enchiladas trillion pound elephant sitting on top of that

137
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,719
Knoxville

138
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:04,095
Where the hell are the bubbles going to take us sitting answer is right into chaos

139
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,143
Rack and ruin and destruction

140
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:10,495
So he's going to be good today and explain how the Lobos going to take us into rack and ruin

141
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,775
So that's a very exciting

142
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,055
That's a very positive message

143
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:16,383
But we've got going on here is that now

144
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,407
This is a hoax

145
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,223
Whole thing is a route know there is a real virus

146
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,783
Okay but being afraid of it is a hoax

147
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,111
In order for the gloves to take control by way of destroying

148
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:29,951
The economy by having people not go to work

149
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,511
Alex discusses have this hoax

150
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,279
But they're doing

151
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:36,095
Call Buster

152
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,375
Amazing

153
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,423
To watch

154
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,263
Flounder around like this

155
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,335
Try one big house after another

156
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:50,687
StairMaster stereo

157
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,503
But now everybody I talk to

158
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:09,887
It looks like it might kill 1% of people that are above 75 and sick

159
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,895
So Alex is definitely caught the right-wing talking

160
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:27,295
Points he is gotten a line with the people are at like the Tucker is in the

161
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:30,623
These were putting forth the Glenn Beck

162
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,927
And Hammer in there in sync.

163
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:38,559
The old people are willing to go and save the Economy Inn

164
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,839
The economy ticket

165
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,119
That's cool

166
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:45,983
It is interesting to think about these people being like you-know-who should

167
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,263
Fight in World War I

168
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,031
The Elder

169
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:51,871
Put them in the front line they're willing to sacrifice them

170
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,919
Themselves for the good of the country

171
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:57,759
They have less time left put them in the trench

172
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,551
Oh no million people died

173
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,855
They're going to die in 2 years anyways come on

174
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:06,719
It's really interesting considering the trajectory of the path that we seen Alex walk down

175
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,487
And

176
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,023
The way that this is

177
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,559
It seems out of Step

178
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:15,167
With the path we've been off lately feels like okay

179
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:19,263
This is the night this is the mood of the right-wing culture now and Alex

180
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:25,663
Is falling in line with his own animal

181
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,967
But he does believe he has

182
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:32,063
In the same way that whenever the going gets weird that we are turned Pro

183
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,599
Quotes about Hunter S Thompson

184
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,367
The

185
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,391
Be

186
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:39,231
If you're all doing that then Alex has to go a little bit beyond

187
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,767
That ain't so

188
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:41,791
Does Kai

189
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:42,559
Kind of get down

190
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,839
That's in the club

191
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,143
He insists that what's going on is

192
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,191
Go to channel that's going to be

193
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:48,959
Coronavirus

194
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,263
Well not the virus but the response to

195
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,639
Gotcha nobody bad

196
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,199
The force shutting down

197
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,063
Constitutional

198
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,599
Deadly dangerous

199
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,367
Where

200
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,207
Point operation immediate Warehouse

201
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:17,631
So it he wants to establish for your first of all.

202
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,727
Personality question and he wants to let you know

203
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,799
This is not because my business is effect

204
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:29,151
Absolutely but I do are completely exempt

205
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:32,479
From the shutdown orders a stay-at-home orders

206
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,527
I'm not worried about it at all

207
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,551
Let's see how the next

208
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,831
40 seconds ago

209
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:37,855
It makes me feel

210
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:44,767
Art supply shops in Annapolis

211
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,815
Today when Austin declares its

212
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,607
Stay open

213
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,911
Academy close in Dallas

214
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:56,799
Walmart

215
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,711
You're in Michigan are there a water filter Supply

216
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:10,367
Selling out

217
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:16,767
This morning and I literally got angle water filters aren't essential

218
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,303
Marijuana

219
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:24,959
Within 30 seconds of him saying that life

220
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:27,519
Is it shut down and I'm very mad about

221
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,079
And all gun stores are spiritually

222
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,895
His sponsor here so any gun stores not being open

223
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,431
Certainly a big slide

224
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:39,551
So yeah he's a probably a little bit misleading there about not to

225
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:43,647
Affected by news about the five-year-old out there who can't get his first a Kayana

226
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,415
His 5th birthday

227
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,183
They then what the f***

228
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,999
F*** are we doing

229
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:52,095
So these government-mandated shutdowns their death

230
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,119
Meladie not unconscious

231
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:53,887
Additional

232
00:12:54,143 --> 00:13:00,287
This point we're really only seen state and local governments putting these kinds of shutdowns or

233
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,311
Call Motors in place

234
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:07,711
And these are well within the rights that states have to protect the community from infectious diseases unconstitutional

235
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:11,807
According to an article in Politico by UC Davis law professor Elizabeth

236
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,087
This is a part of the

237
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,623
States policing powers

238
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,159
Just reserved by the temperamental

239
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,207
Has been affirmed in case law pretty

240
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:22,559
The question of whether Trump could do that on a national level

241
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,095
That's an open question

242
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:26,655
It's not really having a good take on it because there isn't

243
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,423
A good president

244
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,727
Most thinking that he could do it

245
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:33,311
If he could do it it would take the form of an executive order

246
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:36,127
Using this National Emergency declaration is the groundwork

247
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,711
The court could try to challenge it but they might not be quick to

248
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,759
To do that while the virus situation is still intact

249
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,551
Kind of complicated

250
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:44,831
But

251
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:49,695
Even if Trump did this he probably would be unable to do much more than encourage every state

252
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:53,023
To just do what California New York and others are already doing

253
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:58,143
If you were to try to put a lockdown in place in that way that bypasses the state governors

254
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:58,911
Being the one

255
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,679
We were making

256
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,215
Precision and running their home state

257
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,239
There's a pretty decent chance

258
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,263
That would be on top

259
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,567
It seems like if you are a big

260
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,335
States rights

261
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,103
KUB

262
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:11,967
More in favor of the states choosing their own path forward

263
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,735
Or you could

264
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,759
Just called it all on

265
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,831
Use that as a buzzword

266
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:20,927
The general Point here is that nothing is happening right now is

267
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,231
In further there's really nothing

268
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:28,607
Kim happened it would be unconstitutional that would not be initiated by Trump

269
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:34,239
Congress does not ba32 lockdown the country but it could Grant Trump the authority to do that

270
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,543
Probably wouldn't do that unless he requests

271
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,103
He could release an executive order

272
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,663
Outside of that what we see is just

273
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,967
State Governors utilizing their temperament powers

274
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,735
Protective

275
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:49,087
And as you pointed out Alex should be totally fine with that yells about states rights all the fun

276
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:53,695
Nope unconstitutional under Clause 2 of Section 1

277
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,999
Where it says

278
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,047
The Constitution is whatever we say

279
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,839
Sure on whatever day

280
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,631
Napier right-wing propaganda

281
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,191
Otherwise you're not allowed to look at this

282
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,007
I'm pretty sure that

283
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,311
So Alex is really pushing

284
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:14,175
Pretty good on this people want to die

285
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:17,247
In order to make sure that the economy keeps coming along

286
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,527
Just great

287
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,807
And we start to

288
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,343
See the way that this narrative

289
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,111
It's going to take

290
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,647
Take shape over the course

291
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,415
This episode

292
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:30,559
Today from one of my lawyers who's I'm done about 6 years he's a good guy these big Democrat

293
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,607
Well

294
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,911
Means well.

295
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:42,335
Look at my 401k and I'm looking at my first grandchild coming in

296
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,711
Chameleon

297
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:54,111
No I didn't know that

298
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,159
Information

299
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:06,143
I do think we just can't shut everything down for

300
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,871
Indefinitely shut everything down

301
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,407
Does lawyer does not exist

302
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:23,807
This is just Alex doing a voice to repeat his own talking points in the guise of some big Democrat lawyer

303
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,575
Let me know

304
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,367
Yeah such b*******

305
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:32,767
You are in the Great Depression

306
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:35,327
Very common things to know for a lot of lawyers

307
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,607
Did you know that lawyers get

308
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:40,191
Get together on their off-hours and talk about the Great Depression and casual

309
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:44,031
You have to study

310
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,335
This sucks

311
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:47,615
Bulshit

312
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:57,087
But you're going to start to see over the course of this in terms of rationalizing that notion

313
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:00,671
We need to put everyone back to work now damn the torpedoes

314
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,951
Do care about the consequences

315
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:02,719
Or the

316
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,999
The dangers of

317
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,535
Virus the Coronavirus

318
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:11,935
Put everyone back to work cuz if the economy falls apart will have a Great Depression 7 million was starve to death

319
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,983
Cure is worse than the disease

320
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,775
Right so that fixed

321
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:19,103
Statistic is going to become a very important part of his rationalization

322
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,895
Statistics are a huge

323
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,479
And just like

324
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,247
Viruses

325
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:29,343
Mutate you know how they do that huh

326
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,367
Sales pitch

327
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,135
Okay

328
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:34,719
Alex is in a position now where a lot of his normal Avenue

329
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:37,535
For making money during this crisis have been cut off

330
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:41,375
He's got a very Stern warning from the New York attorney general's office

331
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,655
And he can't really

332
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,679
Selfing

333
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,983
Like it silver the way he was

334
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:52,383
He's artificially increase the demand so high on the supply of the food supplier

335
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,175
The Dave had to not allow him

336
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,199
To take orders

337
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:55,967
Anymore

338
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,551
He is in a position where like well I can't do that

339
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,599
But as we saw her last episode

340
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,391
He is now realize that this

341
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,159
Poor Quinn

342
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,719
The Trump was promoting

343
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,999
It involves ink

344
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:11,327
And he sells the real redpill which includes

345
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,631
And so he's going really

346
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,423
Into like

347
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,959
Well now it's time Selznick

348
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,015
With viruses.

349
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:32,575
Happen

350
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,343
The sink

351
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:40,767
What does chlorophyll do

352
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:42,815
Chloroquine

353
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,471
A medical version of what is in

354
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,263
Tonic that you get at the store

355
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:54,591
Wow

356
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:58,175
And their troops all over the equatorial World ago

357
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,223
One of their Jen

358
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,271
Can

359
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:05,599
Alex goes on a rant about gin and tonics

360
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:13,023
Repeatedly like

361
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,327
Many letters from Attorneys General that he can

362
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,399
Is he trying to build a collection there he seems to be like

363
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,191
The kite like a dog

364
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:23,007
Going up to an invisible electric fence getting shocked

365
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:26,591
And then like trying to go a little bit to the side

366
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:28,895
Is this okay

367
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:29,663
This fence

368
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,455
Is a giant Circle but what if I

369
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,223
I just go in

370
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,527
Eventually I'll find every part of this

371
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:37,087
Circle right now it's all about selling

372
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:40,159
And I was able to find some studies it seems

373
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:44,255
Suggested zinc supplementation could have an effect on preventing things like the common cold

374
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:49,119
I'm not going to get too bogged down and Alex's shamelessly transparent attempt to sell the real red pill

375
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,935
I think he's going a little bit overboard but whatever

376
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:52,959
Amore

377
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,263
Bridgeton the fact that you still pushing the clerk

378
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,799
Particularly considering

379
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,335
Call the quarter quell which

380
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:02,943
Which doesn't Inspire confidence that he has a good handle on it

381
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:07,807
By the time we'd recorded our last episode there been to non-fatal overdoses in Nigeria

382
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:08,575
People taking

383
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:11,135
The irresponsible advice to take or Quinta

384
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,415
To treat or prevent the Coronavirus

385
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,439
Virus but since then

386
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:17,791
68 year old man in Arizona died after taking chloroquine phosphate

387
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:20,863
And it's 61 year old wife was sent to the hospital and critical

388
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,631
Condition

389
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,655
She survived

390
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,423
Explain Direct

391
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:28,287
We saw Trump on TV every channel and all his buddies said that it was safe

392
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:30,591
Tom kept saying it was basically pretty much a

393
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,359
Secure

394
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:35,711
Alex has one of those Buddies

395
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,503
Play in the same games as Oliver

396
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:43,903
Yeah news broke about the couple at least a day before the episode that we're listening to right now

397
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,791
Advice has taken at least one life and send others to the hospital and Alex's comparing it to quinine being in tonic water

398
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:56,191
This is absolutely staggering levels of the responsibility that he has on display here it's just you couldn't do a worse job.

399
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,471
If you try

400
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:02,847
I think a lot of people are willing to sacrifice themselves so the Dow doesn't go down a percentage

401
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:07,711
Good point but what we don't know is that also Republicans are willing to kill them

402
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:09,503
To make sure that it doesn't go down to four

403
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,039
You didn't know that

404
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,575
Did not know

405
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,343
It's very

406
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,367
It's very crucial

407
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,391
Crucial

408
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:16,928
Yep

409
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,720
So this is a psyop

410
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:19,744
It's going on

411
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,048
Apparently according to Alex

412
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:24,608
And also Trump knows

413
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,144
But it's a Scion

414
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:31,264
Trump knows so much that doesn't seem to exist or

415
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:36,640
Yeah this is where we get into the other element of the viruses nobigdyl naira

416
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,432
President-trump

417
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,784
Weather in a balancing act

418
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:44,832
Where

419
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:45,856
Bonded

420
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:48,928
The virus has killed people and is a serious issue

421
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:59,936
Ignoring the virus over there they only lost about 4,000

422
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:03,520
Italy's over 5,000 now because they have the oldest population in Europe

423
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,128
Because they all lived

424
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,688
They lose 70,000 on average a year

425
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,480
From the flu there

426
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:17,344
Firstly this is not a psyop

427
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,208
And if the siop is supposed to be portraying the situation that it's the end of the world I only know one

428
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,744
Bucking person who said

429
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,024
It's over for Humanity

430
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,072
It will only be lone survivors

431
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:31,424
So I guess Infowars of the tip of the spear on the siop we've already established

432
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,984
Globulin

433
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,336
Foreshore and he's working for China and in the mainstream media

434
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:45,248
I wanted to take a moment to address Alex is dumb dumb idea that this is just like the flu which he is insinuating at the end of that clip

435
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:47,808
And he has he does say pretty

436
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,344
You consistently over these comparing

437
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,112
Flu deaths

438
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,136
To this

439
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:51,904
I talked to my aunt

440
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:56,768
I think that your aunt

441
00:22:57,024 --> 00:23:00,608
And a lot of folks on Twitter have this narrative in their head and they can

442
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,656
I can't seem to get past

443
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,192
This thing

444
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:08,288
From what I can tell the only thing his argument is based on his a wrong number of deaths

445
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,312
The come from the flu each

446
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:12,128
This is a really incomplete way of looking at

447
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:14,688
The situation and there's a couple of really important consideration

448
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:18,528
Keep in mind to help understand why this coronavirus is definitely not like

449
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:21,600
Flu and if not taken seriously it will be much

450
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,952
The first and easiest to understand Alameda this

451
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,232
A very

452
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,256
Fatality rate

453
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,280
The two conditions

454
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:33,888
The flu has approximately 8.1% fatality rate

455
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,936
Estimates for the coronavirus art about 14

456
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:39,008
But some countries are showing significantly higher numbers than that

457
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,104
I'm just that level it's at least 10 times deadlier for people who getting

458
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:49,248
On top of that you have a higher estimated transmission rate from coronavirus then from the flu

459
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,088
Each person has the flu generally will give it to 1.3 people compared

460
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:55,392
To the at least two people

461
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,160
Both are infected

462
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,184
Each person who has

463
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:57,952
Has the Coronavirus

464
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,072
He person has the virus one average give it to two people and that's triple the number of cases

465
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:05,632
In each iteration

466
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:06,656
Yeah that's how I

467
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:07,936
Exponential growth

468
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,520
But that estimate might actually be really low

469
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:16,640
And part of what makes things really scary is that the coronavirus has an incubation. They can last up to 40

470
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,408
13 days

471
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,480
As opposed to the about 4-day window for the flu

472
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:23,296
Is incubation period is the. Where person

473
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,576
Can you be asymptomatic

474
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:27,904
Have no idea they have the virus but be contagious the entire time

475
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:35,072
Because of his longer incubation. The cases that were seeing arrive in the hospital today maybe people who have been

476
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,608
Sick and not doing it for two we

477
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:43,264
During that time it's possible that they spread the virus to a bunch of other people who we won't know we're sick until the week or two from now

478
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:47,360
It may already be too late to do anything about where we'll be in two weeks

479
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,640
But it's not too late

480
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:51,456
To make sure that three weeks or a month from now things are not

481
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:53,504
Continuing down that same portable Pat

482
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,552
And that's why we should get back to work

483
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,600
Next week makes up Hazmat

484
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,368
Right

485
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:01,184
One of the things that makes this past so bad that

486
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:01,952
You could be on

487
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:06,304
Is that people will coronavirus are approximately 10 times more likely to require hot

488
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,072
Hospitalization

489
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,352
And people who come down with

490
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,120
Flu

491
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,144
Because of this

492
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,264
If they suspect very fast as a potential to completely overwhelm the hospital system in the country

493
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,312
At which point things have the possibility of

494
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,592
Deteriorating dramatic

495
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,640
Especially considering that at the

496
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,432
Point the hospitals are overwhelmed

497
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,968
They're still going to be more patient

498
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:26,272
Come again and people who are coming into things

499
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:28,576
Aren't coronavirus related wrong

500
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:33,952
If there's anything I know about America's Healthcare System as it stands right now it is set up

501
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:35,744
Any challenge

502
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,768
Standings

503
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:42,144
Possibilities American spend more on Healthcare than anybody else in the world to make

504
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:42,912
Make sure that when

505
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:43,936
Outbreak

506
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:47,008
Like this happened we don't have to worry about it then

507
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:53,664
Now you can add on top of that the factor people with coronavirus require a longer and more intensive hospitalization then do most

508
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,432
Patience

509
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,200
I'm in for the flu

510
00:25:55,712 --> 00:26:01,856
A limited sample study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found a median length of stay for Coronavirus patient

511
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:02,880
Doobie 10 days

512
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:06,464
As compared to an average of 6.3 days for the flu

513
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,048
According to a 2015 2016 set of data from the

514
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:12,096
Healthcare cost and utilization project

515
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:19,264
The coronavirus spreads more incubates for longer that's giving a longer contagion window hospitalized as more and causes

516
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,544
Does longer hospital stays

517
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,104
In patients who do end up requiring Medical Care

518
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:26,176
All of these variables combined are unsustainable

519
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,200
At a certain point

520
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:30,272
And you can easily imagine how this will have all sorts of Ripple effects

521
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,552
Could end up being horrific

522
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:33,088
Not least among them

523
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:33,856
All of the

524
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:34,880
The other needs

525
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,928
Of the medical system that would be left

526
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,256
And 000 of the flu

527
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:43,840
People because it's not like this is replacing the flu

528
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,120
The Coronavirus

529
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:53,568
Flu this year there's also people getting influenza top of a coronavirus you can only have one

530
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:59,712
Unconstitutional to have more

531
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,784
So the flu is no joke and I'm not here to say it's not an issue

532
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:08,672
But anytime you hear someone compare our current situation to the flu there either a complete psychopath or there's no idea what they're talking about

533
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,488
Cowards like Alex hide behind a sort of b*******

534
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:15,072
About there being like 50,000 deaths from the flu a year in America

535
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:21,216
That statistic is inaccurate and even if it were do you think you would change his tune if like 55,000 people end up dead

536
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,496
From the Coronavirus

537
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,288
It's just a mask

538
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,824
Absolutely

539
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:28,384
So some of this information to little bit wrong

540
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,456
41 Tappan has a higher proportion of people over the age of

541
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:35,296
65 in Italy but that's not in Europe

542
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:41,696
If you haven't media if you're going by median age Germany and Monaco both have populations that are older than Italy so those are

543
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,280
Also Alex's dad about 70,000 flu deaths

544
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,304
2 year and Italy

545
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,328
Completely incorrect

546
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,400
It comes from him not knowing how to read

547
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:54,752
There's a study was published in November 2019 in the international Journal of infectious

548
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:55,520
Just diseases

549
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,824
2000 flu deaths

550
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,128
Italy during the time period study

551
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,176
I'm fairly certain that this is a source

552
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:08,576
But what he fails to point out that this study covered the period of winter 2013 through the end of flu season

553
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,344
27th

554
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,624
Every year

555
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:11,648
What

556
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,184
That's 4 years

557
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,976
Okay so that's that's

558
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:18,304
What 280,000 deaths per year

559
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,352
We don't know you're you're multiplying instead of

560
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,888
Striker dividing

561
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:26,496
Also it's really needs to be pointed out that this study wasn't

562
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:32,640
They took all-cause fatality data from the country and then combined it with the rates of people getting in

563
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:39,040
Influenza-like illnesses and estimated that there would be 68000 deaths attributable to the flu in that five years

564
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:41,600
The study literally says quote

565
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,392
The study should be validated using

566
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:47,488
Cause specific mortality data which however was not available

567
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:49,024
For the entire study.

568
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:51,584
No matter how you slice it Alex's number is

569
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,352
Completely false

570
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,888
Some contacts he's providing it in

571
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,704
Actually according to that very study

572
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,472
2013

573
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,240
Jeep 2014

574
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,776
Flu season throwing that time

575
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:03,360
There were 7027 deaths in Italy attributable to the

576
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,128
The flu

577
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:06,688
As of the time that I Was preparing this episode

578
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:10,016
It's higher now but there were 7503 death

579
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:11,808
From the coronavirus in Italy

580
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:13,088
Already hired

581
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,624
Glad for the year

582
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:17,952
The signup is not the media saying that this is the end of the world

583
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:18,976
Because the media isn't so

584
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:22,048
Alex Jones and his friends were a couple of months

585
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:26,656
The song up his people like Alex and most of the right-wing media tried to convince their audio

586
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:28,448
Reality is reality

587
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,520
It's a game they play so often and generally they get away with it

588
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:33,824
Because they're yelling about stuff like the war on Christmas

589
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:34,848
Some other booty

590
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,640
Concerned it's completely made up

591
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,688
Absolutely this one is not

592
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,224
And no amount of yelling it's just

593
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,760
Like the flu go back to work

594
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,552
It's going to make things right

595
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,320
It's not the

596
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:49,440
Nope but doesn't play by the same rules as these other propaganda narratives really does feel like this

597
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:51,744
Like you

598
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,024
Like it's almost like

599
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:57,632
The culmination of all right-wing propaganda is to eventually get it

600
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,400
It's people too

601
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:00,960
Like it is

602
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,264
It's almost like Fox News was a false flag

603
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,616
To kill the elderly at the end of the day like they started at 20 years ago

604
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,640
And they're like okay

605
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,688
We're going to have too many old

606
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:14,016
It's just going to happen we got to do something about this

607
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,040
I have a new

608
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,832
We're going to get a black president

609
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,112
And we're going to lose people

610
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:20,928
Mines and then killing the payoff and kill

611
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:27,328
Yeah I mean like if we were on Infowars you be suggesting that is a serious thought

612
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,424
Alex

613
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:35,008
Because everything is so different now

614
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,288
On in his rhetoric

615
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,336
He's trying to underplay all this

616
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:41,664
Keep out has to sort of pretend like the pastor

617
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,200
Didn't realize

618
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:43,968
Say that stuff

619
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,248
So here's Warner

620
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,320
Was never about the virus

621
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,600
It was okay

622
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:53,952
Pandemonium are they are freaking out

623
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,840
Because of the economy and the breakdown and the global is trying to use it

624
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,448
Virus

625
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:08,544
Because

626
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,592
So I will grant

627
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:12,896
That Alex does always talk

628
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:14,432
About the economy

629
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:16,480
And now you should Panic about

630
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:20,576
Play music gold salesman cuz he had a board

631
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:23,904
Strong financial interest in the that narrative but

632
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,744
You know that isn't entirely inaccurate but

633
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,864
Yes it's viruses deadly it's not like SARS and things that were just a hype up and scare people

634
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,728
They were saying last week

635
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:43,872
On

636
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,688
228

637
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:49,760
Thousand confirmed we're locked in here a few minutes go 24,000

638
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:53,600
The internal Chinese numbers that leaked

639
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,416
Rocky publish in China by the people daily

640
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:58,464
Said 24000 dead

641
00:31:58,976 --> 00:31:59,488
Yesterday

642
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,096
So what we think they're doing is they're just putting the number of dad is a number of infect

643
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:07,680
When your sources at the UN from your own research how bad is this

644
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,104
Computer game at

645
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,384
John's hot

646
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,688
Hopkinsville

647
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,784
That's the only figure I have seen

648
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,064
Seems to be

649
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,368
Route to be a 20

650
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,136
Percent

651
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,160
Mortality rate

652
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,720
The official numbers now show

653
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:37,120
Chinese government says 15%

654
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:39,168
They're just introducing us

655
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,216
New age of the new millennium

656
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:43,264
This isn't just going to be

657
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:46,592
The kills people that have anal sex or whatever or use needle

658
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:52,224
This is something that's going to kill you and your family and make you have a heart attack and make your lungs bleed out

659
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:53,504
And it

660
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,528
Stocks

661
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:55,808
It's true

662
00:32:56,064 --> 00:33:00,928
That is very concerned.

663
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:06,304
But now the numbers are coming out we know that it is indeed

664
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:10,400
Killing healthy young people that is killing a high number of those

665
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,240
Coming out of places like an l

666
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,080
A beginning a swell

667
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:20,384
You can't believe a word

668
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:22,176
The comes out of tricon's mouth

669
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:23,456
Go back a month ago

670
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,320
Horrible Foods

671
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,600
Sponsors a lot of

672
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,136
You listen

673
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:40,096
Spreading all over the world and it's

674
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,120
Got a high kill rate

675
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:44,704
The world is kind of high kill

676
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:46,240
Wow

677
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,848
Right now but not the way I want to sell it

678
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:51,616
Poor guy

679
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:58,272
His narratives harder than rise of Skywalker this is brutal

680
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:00,320
Just because of

681
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:06,720
Part of the things you said before doesn't mean that he wasn't driving real hard

682
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:10,560
And some of those

683
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:13,632
Numbers might sound more close to Accurate now

684
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:15,936
But he was saying them as the reality

685
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:19,520
Two-and-a-half months ago so they were not true then

686
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:22,848
They might lead to a little bit of a like

687
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,640
Far off

688
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:27,968
Still

689
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:29,760
Civil

690
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,552
So Alex

691
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:33,856
You can just see an absolute

692
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,672
Desire to pretend the past

693
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,440
And his

694
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,464
His rhetoric has

695
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,488
And then what it has

696
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,096
We get through this a little bit more you'll start to understand exactly why that's the case

697
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:48,960
But Alex is thrilled with the idea that Trump is coming out saying that

698
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:49,728
Got to

699
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:50,752
Get back to work

700
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:52,544
Do that

701
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:59,200
Number of jobs almost 160 million

702
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:05,600
I think it's going to be wonderful to be tremendous repercussions it will be from that

703
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:13,024
Probably more death from that then anything to were talking about with respect

704
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,304
A2Z virus

705
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,400
So they're listening to

706
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,728
Obelisk d.c.

707
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:24,288
University studies

708
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:28,896
The Great Depression killed seven million people malnutrition

709
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:31,200
That 7 billion people I number

710
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:34,016
Is not true

711
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:40,416
That's an erroneous stat based on flawed research that was but advertised specifically as anti u.s. Pro Sophia propaganda

712
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:44,256
A real study to back up his claim

713
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:50,656
It's the best I can do is article and profit about the flawed research that has been widely discredited

714
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:54,496
Major universities major university studies

715
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,264
What an ass

716
00:35:56,288 --> 00:36:01,152
The problem with Trump and Alex's argument about their desire to turn the economy back on as they put it is that it

717
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:01,920
It's Dom

718
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:07,552
The framing of that argument that they think that they're having is that the virus will cause X number of deaths

719
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:13,184
But to avoid those deaths you need to shut down the economy temporarily which could lead to wider number of deaths

720
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:16,000
According to them if x is lower than y

721
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:16,768
It's not worth it

722
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:17,536
Did the shutdown

723
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,328
Things in order to stop the virus we should

724
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:20,096
Need to take the hit

725
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,120
Keep moving

726
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,192
Their thinking is flawed because it's not a question

727
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:27,008
Of X number of deaths versus y number of death

728
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:28,544
If you don't take this

729
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,312
Seriously

730
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:30,848
And take some action now

731
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:34,176
We will get that X number of deaths from the virus which will lead to

732
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,968
Complete collapse of our medical system

733
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:37,248
According to many experts

734
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:39,808
Ultimately and even worse economic collapse

735
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:42,112
Then you would have had from a temporary shutdown

736
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,136
In effect

737
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:45,440
One of your leg your options

738
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,720
Ry or

739
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:53,120
X + y 2x option that's on the table that is realistic or feasible

740
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,656
Love's Edition they're not big

741
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,960
Hands of a single variable

742
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:57,728
Man you got to have

743
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,776
Two variables got a smashing together

744
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:00,800
Silly

745
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:05,152
Insane in circumstances like this you should always choose the option that's

746
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:05,920
Controllable

747
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:09,760
The amount of pain that could be caused by this economic shutdown is pretty high

748
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:12,576
But all that pain can be mitigated by government action

749
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:18,464
There could be relief provided that if properly handled could minimize the amount of death that would be caused by a shutdown

750
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:21,024
That's a problem that can solve itself

751
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:21,792
If we let

752
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,096
The same is not true of Legend

753
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:27,936
The consequences of coronavirus just run free through the workplace

754
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:29,472
And population

755
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:32,032
The effects and consequences of that are fairly

756
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:32,800
Unpredictable

757
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:35,872
Outside of being a we can probably predicted it would be really bad

758
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,736
The unspoken argument that's being made here is that the well-being of Corporations

759
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,016
Is more important than your life

760
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,296
Alex

761
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:47,648
Pretend that's not what he saying by citing his bogus stat about starvation of the Great Depression

762
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:49,440
But mainstream right-wing talking

763
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:53,536
Pinpoint the one that he's working off of is exactly what you see on Fox News

764
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,304
Glenn Beck

765
00:37:55,072 --> 00:38:01,216
Glenn Beck said on his show on March 24th the same day as this episode that quote I would rather have my children stay home and all of us

766
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:02,496
Over 50 going

767
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:04,544
And keep this economy going and working

768
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,360
Even if we all get sick I would rather die than kill the country

769
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,968
Trump's advisor Larry Kudlow beard on Fox News and said quote

770
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:13,760
The Cure can't be worse than the disease

771
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:14,784
And we're going to have

772
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,576
Have to make some difficult trade-offs

773
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,672
The conversation that's happening on the right at this point is how if

774
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:24,256
It can help the stock market thousands of deaths are an acceptable price

775
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:26,304
To pay or at very worried

776
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:28,096
A quote difficult trade-offs

777
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,144
This is the talking point that Alex

778
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:30,912
Putting forth

779
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,704
The Cowardly mask is fake

780
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,472
Depression stat

781
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,032
Alex is arguing that the market is more important

782
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:37,056
Public Health

783
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,336
Which should be problem for him

784
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:42,176
Forgot who yelled about Obama Death panels for years for

785
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:42,944
Yahoo

786
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,784
Just as recently as a few days ago was ranting about Bill Gates and the quote

787
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,064
For killing granny

788
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,136
You would think that he would be against the idea of sacrifice of human lives

789
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:54,464
Serve the economic interests of the already very rich but

790
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,488
Whatever

791
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:58,048
It does feel like the rich

792
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,584
HR just convince

793
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,608
That America is

794
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:02,656
Is no longer capable of torches and pay

795
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:08,032
Like they're just like it's just never going to happen again so we can act with impunity

796
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:11,360
Huber it does seem like you

797
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,664
But I don't know maybe they're right

798
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:20,064
It does seem like they've convinced a large enough number of people to essentially acted ways that would kill

799
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:25,696
Hinderer anybody else from doing it I don't know maybe maybe it's just

800
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:26,976
Where We Are

801
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,512
Vassals were

802
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:29,280
Worser

803
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:30,816
I don't know

804
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,096
So Alex

805
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:35,680
Austin has put in place this

806
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:36,704
You know stay at home

807
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:37,728
Situation

808
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,008
And Alex's

809
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:40,800
Barry

810
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:41,824
Insistent

811
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,104
That you know

812
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:44,384
Infowars

813
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,944
What is not involved in that and they are exempt

814
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:49,760
Travis County Austin Texas shut down order

815
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:51,552
I just came out 1 hour ago

816
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:55,392
Home work safe order 20200

817
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,160
3

818
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:57,952
Forecast

819
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,000
By the mayor of the City of Austin

820
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:15,616
Listen to me because it's too much fun to get

821
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,456
It's over for Humanity

822
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:22,272
Last week

823
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:25,088
Was in place last week

824
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:27,136
I'm not sure why why Alex

825
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,672
Always get so defensive about the

826
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:31,232
The dumb people he talks to her wrong about things

827
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:37,888
But if his friends and associates. They had to stay indoors by government degree like a week ago that reflects poorly on them

828
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:38,912
More than anything else

829
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:40,960
He knows uninformed people

830
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:47,360
And I have no idea why you feel the need to insist that everyone is as dumb as his friends secret knowledge

831
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:49,408
Also I have no idea why he's making so

832
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:51,456
Such a huge production out of proving that is businesses

833
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:54,784
Probably technically considered an essential business according to the Austin

834
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,552
Stay-at-home order

835
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:56,832
It's a very weird

836
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,112
And I don't know what he's worth

837
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:58,880
Bonding to

838
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:04,256
And also those numbers of the bill the 2020-32

839
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,024
Board that's

840
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:05,792
Skip the date

841
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:07,840
No yeah

842
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:13,728
Don't you dare what I mean it is the title of the

843
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:15,008
Yeah it's just the date

844
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:17,312
So I

845
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:21,664
I was curious about this and I'm like why is he so defensive

846
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,944
About being exam

847
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:26,272
Well know he is but he gives a little bit of a clue here

848
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:33,184
Bleeding at the emergency wasn't place last week

849
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:38,560
Holding the federal laws

850
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:47,520
This is starting to come into focus with me

851
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:51,872
I have a strong suspicion that this may at least be a related to some members of Alex

852
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:53,919
The staff not wanting to come in during the outbreak

853
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,199
Which I completely understand

854
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:57,247
However what I find interesting

855
00:41:57,503 --> 00:42:00,063
Sing about that clip is it a tells us a lot about what Alex's employees

856
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,343
Think about what he does

857
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:04,671
For one he claims as an authoritative fact

858
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:05,695
Don't even claim that

859
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:07,231
You know something

860
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:08,767
Biggest thing that we know where essential

861
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:10,559
And their responses that syrup

862
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,631
That tells me that his staff know that Alex is

863
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:14,655
Is full of s***

864
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:16,191
And they don't trust him to know any

865
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:19,519
The only reason you would ever respond to someone like that is

866
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:21,311
If you don't believe that I'm just biding

867
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:23,615
Yeah that's that has the sound of

868
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,639
Of them just being like

869
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:25,407
Buddy

870
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:26,687
We know you

871
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:27,455
Wework

872
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:29,503
Shut the fuk up

873
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:33,087
We don't care what you have to say because you're a f****** like you're wrong

874
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,111
All the time

875
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:37,439
Second this tells me that at least some of the enforced staff

876
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:39,231
Do not feel like what they do is

877
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:45,887
If Alex shows them disorder that says that news organizations are clearly exempt and they're still not convinced of

878
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:48,703
The point of show

879
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:50,751
Propaganda QVC

880
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:53,311
3rd and possibly most importantly

881
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:55,359
Alex's Alex's crew has a

882
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,151
No idea what's going on in the real world

883
00:42:57,919 --> 00:43:00,735
If they thought there was a lockdown in place a week prior

884
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:02,271
Then they're completely lost

885
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:04,831
These are the sorts of people Alex has work

886
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:06,623
It is alleged news Operation

887
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:08,671
People have no idea what's happening around

888
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:10,207
And that does explain a lot

889
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,999
So thank you for giving me that glimpse

890
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:13,535
Into

891
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:15,071
Yeah that's that's a boy

892
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:16,351
That's a boss bitching

893
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,119
Employees lunch

894
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:18,655
Yeah I think

895
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:20,447
That's probably what the what's the

896
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:21,471
Emotion

897
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:22,239
Behind you

898
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:25,055
Send a text with Alex gives a big brag

899
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,335
That I think is

900
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:29,407
Incorrect going to start by saying he's not going to brag no

901
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:30,431
Just Brakes

902
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:43,743
The Constitution

903
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:52,959
I am full

904
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:56,543
Knowledge is power

905
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:58,847
Information is power

906
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:02,687
That's why they don't want you to

907
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:06,271
I want you to have

908
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:08,319
As so

909
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,087
Lamp

910
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:09,855
Husbad

911
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:11,391
I can recite

912
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,159
Most

913
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:13,951
Of the pillow protectors

914
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:15,487
Amendment 1

915
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:16,255
2

916
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,791
3

917
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:24,191
How many are in the Bill of Rights I just know the second one that's most of it's mainly the one

918
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,471
More words than I remember

919
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:29,055
I love to say whatever I want to say but then

920
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:29,823
That like

921
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:32,895
Knowledge is power

922
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:41,599
So that would suggest somebody who knows all of the Bill of Rights

923
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:47,231
I would love the idea of like just being a Gaston studio and being like I know most of the Bill of Rights

924
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:48,511
What are the

925
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:51,071
Name them right now right now right now

926
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:54,911
What's the 6th Amendment

927
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:56,191
Sixth amendment that much

928
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:56,959
Tell me what the six

929
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:57,727
He has

930
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:58,751
No idea

931
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:03,103
So I'm his next clip Alex gets to talking about how

932
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:04,383
You know

933
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,663
Media media

934
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:06,943
Trying to take people's right

935
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:10,271
Suppose the president said about not panicking

936
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,087
Cowards

937
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:14,623
Edsby

938
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,671
Onelife

939
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:24,607
Tattoo

940
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:25,631
Hear it

941
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:27,167
Stitches

942
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:29,983
Alright buddy

943
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:31,263
Clutch

944
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:36,383
The actual micro microchips in deerskin under the skin

945
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:39,199
I'm out

946
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:41,503
Are they made with Nana

947
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:50,207
China's doing and everybody doing and it's all here

948
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:53,023
The mark of the beast everything happening

949
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:54,559
Totally insane

950
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:59,935
DIY White House were the ones who are trying to request the ability to track Everyone by their cell phone data

951
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:02,751
I was not vmedia

952
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:03,519
His employees

953
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:09,151
Alex can pretend all David is heroism doing the exact same things he's claiming the villains are doing

954
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:09,919
But that doesn't make

955
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:10,687
True

956
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:15,551
Also that story about the vaccine tattoos is no more true than it was when it was a lie

957
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:16,319
A few days ago

958
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:21,183
There's Research into a possible invisible tattoo that could be used as a vaccine record

959
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:23,487
But it's nowhere near ready for implementation

960
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:29,375
The only citation Alex has about this is a headline that says quote Asia deploys Innovative if invasive Tech

961
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,399
Coronavirus

962
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:32,447
Which does not mention these tattoos at all

963
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:35,263
Kind of sounds like it might if you only read the headline

964
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,799
What if you were paying attention

965
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,383
There's so many things that

966
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,151
I could be in there

967
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:46,271
Oh my God just imagine what kind of innovative invasive technolite bacon that article

968
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:47,551
Probably shooting

969
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:51,135
Scott archery so much more interesting articles

970
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:53,439
Knives all day

971
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:56,511
So Alex is celebrating that the market is

972
00:46:56,767 --> 00:47:00,607
Is going back up to drop the same people need to go to work

973
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,911
Jones

974
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:03,935
Industrial

975
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:05,471
Is today

976
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:07,519
Driving down

977
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:11,359
It's up

978
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:13,663
Wow one

979
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:17,759
730 three-point

980
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:24,415
That's not a reason to go up

981
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,439
The stock market went up

982
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:33,887
I've been suppressing China and India another area

983
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:47,967
Really that's what he said

984
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:51,807
Again

985
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:54,623
In the market even though the Democrats

986
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,415
Holding up

987
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:57,695
Stimulus package

988
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:59,231
Give me the latest on that

989
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:02,047
Alex should be in favor of these bailouts

990
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:05,887
Have a problem with Obama was supposed to be the stimulus package and how was

991
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:06,911
Fiscally irresponsible

992
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:11,519
Alex kinky was goddamn principal straight it's just disoriented this makes no sense

993
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:13,823
Also I would like to make a formal predict

994
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:16,639
I rarely make predictions on the show but I feel

995
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:18,175
A hundred percent confident

996
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:21,247
Alright let's see if Trump does Rush people back to work

997
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:22,271
Alex will celebrate

998
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:23,295
Then

999
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:26,111
If things get as bad as experts are suggesting that he could

1000
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:28,927
Alex who pretend he wasn't in favor of that plan

1001
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:31,743
And in fact it was the globalist like mnuchin

1002
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:33,535
Before strop to sacrifice

1003
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:34,815
The good people of this country

1004
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:40,703
Deceive the international Bankers money in the stock market

1005
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,495
Specially led by Bill Maher

1006
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:45,567
King of the left Steve mnuchin

1007
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,383
This will almost certainly be how he rewrites

1008
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:52,223
I'm almost positive

1009
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:54,783
Cause of disaster and then blame everybody else

1010
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:56,063
It is

1011
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,343
Like the stock market

1012
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,879
Going up and down in the pass

1013
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:00,927
Last few weeks has made me want to start

1014
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:03,999
It's just pretend

1015
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:08,351
Goes up because he says something that he probably won't do so there's 1,000

1016
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:12,191
Boys that go up then tomorrow it's going to go down by 1,000 points doesn't

1017
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:16,031
It's empty why are we still pretending it does

1018
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:19,615
Very it's very strange it's kind of surreal to watch

1019
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:20,639
It yeah

1020
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:27,295
Yeah what are we doing here it does I don't know about starting fires I think that's irresponsible at someone's house

1021
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,319
Burned out

1022
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:32,671
Triggering me I apologize

1023
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:39,071
I would say that it might be an indication that we need to rethink how that whole thing works

1024
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:41,887
Settle down maybe we take a look at this whole thing about Market

1025
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:42,911
Abby

1026
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:45,215
Let's figure out how to do this better

1027
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:51,615
That's why we got to elect Joe Biden for president and and make sure that I get a gyro tattoos

1028
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:52,895
Never had stocks

1029
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:56,991
I don't know if it's true. My thought on Twitter

1030
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:58,783
Why not

1031
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:01,855
Anyway this next clip I really I think

1032
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:02,623
This

1033
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:03,903
Is

1034
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:04,927
Pure form of a

1035
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:07,999
Pegasus really his Solon

1036
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:08,767
Display

1037
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:10,815
And he's reading a bunch of headlines

1038
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:15,679
That are people who have warnings about the disastrous consequences that could come

1039
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:17,727
Promos not taking a very response

1040
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:20,287
Pulls right towards that this

1041
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,311
The circumstance

1042
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:22,847
That were in right now

1043
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,895
And how bad things could be

1044
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:28,223
DC closes businesses Louisiana

1045
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:34,623
America

1046
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:38,207
Dubliner clampdown even as president considers easing

1047
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:46,399
Unemployment claims Parts delayed check Goldman buy gold

1048
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:51,775
Anymore

1049
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:59,967
Farewell

1050
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:06,879
Pot shops

1051
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:08,159
Liquor stores

1052
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:17,887
An warning

1053
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:24,287
India lockdown

1054
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:42,975
Dow Jones Industrial Average

1055
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:46,559
That right there is the image I want you to keep in your mind of Alex Jones

1056
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:50,911
As this gets worse and the realization that this isn't a globalist Blatz that's in

1057
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,447
Remember that f****** monster

1058
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:59,103
Remember Alex Jones is the person who mockingly read headlines about the possibility of all doctors being infected with the Coronavirus

1059
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:03,455
Remember Alex Jones was the person who mockingly read a headline about the possibility

1060
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:04,223
The real

1061
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:06,271
Opening businesses prematurely could have horrible

1062
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:08,319
Remember him like that

1063
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:09,599
Because that's who he is

1064
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:12,159
Alex has made all the money he can offer

1065
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:14,207
This crisis so he doesn't really give a s*** and

1066
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:20,863
You stopped selling the food buckets most likely because he caused a run on his supplier who couldn't keep up with the artificially inflated demand

1067
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:23,679
According to Infowars website as of March

1068
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:25,727
25th are opening back up orders

1069
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:31,615
Quote for a very limited time but it's also been called pre-orders and there's like a 12-week delay on delivery

1070
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:33,663
So this is no longer going to be something to

1071
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:34,943
Can push with the same intensity

1072
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:40,319
If the whole idea is that the s*** is about to hit the fan so you need to act now to get this food

1073
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:43,391
It's hard to balance that with buy this now you'll get the food and like

1074
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:44,159
Three months

1075
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:45,951
At the same time

1076
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,743
The New York attorney general's letter

1077
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:52,095
And he knows better than to try and insinuate that is product or

1078
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:54,399
Protection from water solution to the virus

1079
00:52:54,655 --> 00:53:00,031
Which is how he was marketing them for a stretch where you know he was more interested in making the audience afraid of the virus

1080
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:04,639
There's no Financial incentive and now it's making the audience afraid that way anymore

1081
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:05,663
So he's not doing it

1082
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:08,223
As it stands now he has nothing to gain

1083
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:08,991
For making the audience

1084
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:11,551
Afraid of the fire so he's moved the rhetoric to the

1085
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:13,599
I have some people will get it there be some jazz

1086
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:14,623
Looks like the flu talk

1087
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:15,647
Cuz that's

1088
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:16,671
Where it is

1089
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:18,463
Like most of

1090
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:19,999
Where is the money right

1091
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:22,559
The money is in not losing money

1092
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:24,863
In an economic shutdown

1093
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:25,887
Autonomy

1094
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:31,263
He can make the argument all day that his business is exempt from the shutdown and he might be right but in

1095
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:32,799
In a time of difficulty and layoffs

1096
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:36,127
How many was ridiculously price pills do you think is going to be selling

1097
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:38,943
Do you want his listeners are choosing what essential do you think

1098
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:40,735
Bone broth is going to make the cut

1099
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:43,295
I think for a surprising number of people at will in that

1100
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:48,415
That bums me out real I don't think so

1101
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:49,695
He may not have always been

1102
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:51,487
He's grown into

1103
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:54,303
A vapid cruel profiteering mod

1104
00:53:55,327 --> 00:54:01,471
If you need any further evidence that Alex Jones is a piece of s*** and he's only driven by his own bottom line you can find it buried in that clip

1105
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:04,031
You responded to it a little bit and it's this

1106
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:08,895
Unemployment claims to Parts delayed checks Goldman buy gold now

1107
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:10,943
Right there

1108
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:16,831
You see a momentary flash of him remembering that he used to make a lot of money selling gold off yard is just like this

1109
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:17,855
He remembers it

1110
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:19,135
And there's a moment of

1111
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:22,975
But there's no money in it from to pitch Cole to his audience now so he does

1112
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:24,255
That's the

1113
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:27,071
Hell that's how you know he doesn't mean what he sells

1114
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:30,655
If he philosophically believed in buying gold that part of the show wouldn't have

1115
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:32,703
Curiously ended when Teddy Anderson lost

1116
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:33,983
Is precious metals license

1117
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:37,055
If Alex believed the magical gold

1118
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:38,591
Oldest oldest audience for years

1119
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:39,359
In-N-Out

1120
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:41,151
Answer to be imaginary Financial

1121
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:42,687
Collapsi got prophesying

1122
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:47,039
He would keep telling them to buy gold and you be telling people to buy gold now

1123
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:48,063
Even though he wouldn't be

1124
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:48,831
Beginning a cut

1125
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:53,951
For the last month we would have been hearing and being like our everything's going to go to Hell by gold now

1126
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:57,023
Hey look I don't have any

1127
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:58,047
Sponsor but there's

1128
00:54:58,303 --> 00:55:00,351
Plenty of them go find yourself gold

1129
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:01,887
He doesn't do that

1130
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:03,423
Cuz he's a f****** fraud

1131
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:05,471
Dick

1132
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:08,287
Guy sucks can't believe that there

1133
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:10,079
I can't believe how many people are buying the

1134
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:14,943
So many people are buying the line by

1135
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:19,807
The line is people are willing to die in a pandemic for you

1136
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:21,855
Fred Wild

1137
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:23,647
That is wildlife

1138
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:26,463
The opportunity for the

1139
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:27,743
Oh man

1140
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:28,767
Yep

1141
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:29,791
It's it's a mess

1142
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:32,607
Yeah we need to end abortion so we can kill the old people

1143
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,911
And then will restart

1144
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:36,447
Make sense

1145
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:37,215
Man

1146
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:42,335
So Alex Goes to Carl's and I takes one call and then I don't I don't

1147
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:43,103
Because guys

1148
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:45,663
Went on

1149
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:46,943
CDC website

1150
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:48,479
Dc.gov

1151
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:50,015
I was trying to

1152
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:51,807
Find

1153
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:52,831
Virus

1154
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:54,111
In in the US

1155
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:55,647
And I can

1156
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:58,207
Or anyting

1157
00:55:58,463 --> 00:55:58,975
Honor

1158
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:03,071
Hundreds of people that have it and nobody's died yet so

1159
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:12,799
Why we working is Trump fauci get fired

1160
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:18,175
I got to say there was a time when I would have said Trump would never fire the guy who's been the director of the national anthem

1161
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:19,711
Attitude of allergy and infectious

1162
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:24,831
Diseases of the 1984 in the middle of an active pandemic

1163
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:25,599
Max

1164
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:27,391
I hear Alex like that and

1165
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:29,183
I don't think it would surprise me too much

1166
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:31,999
Be fired fauci and replace them like Jared Kushner

1167
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:33,023
Triple H

1168
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:33,791
I don't know

1169
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:34,559
Might as well

1170
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:36,351
McMahon is free right

1171
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:38,655
Also factories with the NIH

1172
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:40,959
What are you

1173
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:42,751
I'll go ahead and sign off on

1174
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:47,359
Half of what they call her saying though it's much as the cdc's website is not the best suppository

1175
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:48,127
Information

1176
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:54,527
The information he's looking for is easily available though I just I don't I don't know why you insist he has to find it on the cdc's

1177
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:56,831
Agree with him through website could be better

1178
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:57,855
Also

1179
00:56:58,111 --> 00:57:01,183
If there are cities where they have confirmed cases but not deaths

1180
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:03,743
That does not necessarily mean that they will all be recover

1181
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:06,815
It's also possible that these cases are still active case

1182
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:07,583
Something Alex

1183
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:09,631
Doesn't

1184
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:10,655
Doesn't happen

1185
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:11,679
Anyway

1186
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:13,727
This next clip

1187
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:14,751
Staggering

1188
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:16,543
Everything in it is

1189
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:19,359
Just about everything in this

1190
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:23,199
Listen very carefully because there's a bunch of points where Alex is just like

1191
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:25,503
You can almost hear him

1192
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:27,039
In a writers room

1193
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:29,855
Yeah yeah bouncing ideas off of

1194
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:32,159
Blue Sky

1195
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:38,303
Lockdown so government can be a savior that's a big Jack and push a force inoculation

1196
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:41,631
The virus is just now starting to explode

1197
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:45,471
Other people as well

1198
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:46,239
Just like

1199
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:49,823
Coronavirus or flu virus does the greater numbers

1200
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:53,407
And that's how people aren't scared

1201
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:55,711
Viruses are scared of new one

1202
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:00,319
It's a real problem

1203
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:04,671
Older people go ahead video tape it put it on the internet

1204
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:05,951
Locked up for that

1205
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:11,071
Everything

1206
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:12,863
The word out

1207
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:23,359
To get the maximum fear then I went oh it's no problem now we're back to work

1208
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:27,967
But then I pop an 18-month shutdown of the US

1209
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:29,247
Psyop

1210
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:31,295
Didn't respond properly

1211
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:33,599
It is a cooked

1212
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:34,623
Superfly

1213
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:36,671
Ordering Chinese

1214
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:37,695
Virus

1215
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:40,255
So they would know the trajectory of it

1216
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:41,791
This is wow

1217
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:42,815
Almeda

1218
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:44,863
Wow and what's amazing about it is

1219
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,911
A lot of it directly contradict

1220
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:48,447
His previous narrative

1221
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:49,983
This is staggering

1222
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:55,615
I want to I want to take this piece-by-piece or at least a lot of these pieces because they are

1223
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:57,151
So a quote

1224
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:59,967
They said people aren't scared of old viruses

1225
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:01,247
Cuz they're scared of new one

1226
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:03,039
Altos make that up

1227
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:05,087
I'll be dead certain that if a new vac

1228
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:09,439
Seen resistant widely transmittable polio showed up or like a vaccine resist

1229
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:14,047
Version of measles came around cold virus

1230
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:20,447
Bar Rescue the s*** out of me going to watch reruns of the match game to Dan

1231
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:22,239
Card sharks

1232
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:27,103
They're scared of things out of China so China took a real outbreak

1233
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:29,151
So Alex thinks this is a real outbreak

1234
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:31,199
I thought Obama sold

1235
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:36,063
What's the China they released on themselves of the false flag or something

1236
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:36,831
Outbreak

1237
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:37,599
I don't know

1238
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:41,951
China told their people go ahead and videotape that put it on the internet

1239
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:48,607
Right there was no evidence supporting information at all Oz just decided to report that the Chinese government produced

1240
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:50,911
Or facilitated all those videos

1241
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:54,495
He's previously used to scare his audience which is like this

1242
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:59,103
I saw a haunting video last night

1243
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:00,127
Cecily was in

1244
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:00,895
Chinese

1245
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:02,687
And it was just a video

1246
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:03,967
Wuhan

1247
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:06,015
Of all the apartment buildings at night

1248
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:07,039
Light in the background

1249
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:08,319
And The Scream

1250
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:11,391
The Haunting blood-curdling screams

1251
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:12,671
People that mental

1252
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,719
I want to see a nevermind

1253
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:17,279
I will yeah we've got the link

1254
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:20,863
February 24th I guess that was a China putting out proper

1255
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:23,935
Mike Adams and Alex are disseminated

1256
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:25,727
Even more infuriating because they

1257
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:27,263
Tried to stop it

1258
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:33,919
They put the man who leaked it into jail and then let him die of Coronavirus

1259
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:39,039
It's the complete opposite he was like dude it's not even wrong it's

1260
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:41,087
Demonstrable Eevee opposite

1261
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:45,183
That's fake news

1262
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:50,815
Space

1263
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:53,887
Quote and so they did with GG and ping

1264
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:56,959
The party said they put the word out to hype this up

1265
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:59,775
I was just completely making that up he has no evidence of it it's

1266
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:02,335
Completely pulled out of thin air as he's just riffing around

1267
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:03,871
Quote

1268
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:04,639
The numbers up

1269
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:09,247
Hype the death numbers up now that's now Wall Street Journal

1270
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:11,039
China lied about the numbers

1271
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:12,319
But they were much higher

1272
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:14,111
First things first

1273
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:17,439
About who's Pacifica guilty of lying about inflated numbers out of China

1274
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,207
UB wise

1275
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:22,047
Consider that Alex spent multiple days on his show back in early February

1276
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:27,935
Pretending that they'll probably a glitch on a website had revealed secretly that there were actually over

1277
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:29,215
24000 deaths

1278
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:30,239
From Coronavirus

1279
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:31,519
In China

1280
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:33,311
As of February

1281
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:37,663
Coronavirus situation in Aldie

1282
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:39,199
Biological weapons expert

1283
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:43,039
And a top scientist scanning the virus and saying it's man-made

1284
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:45,599
We've got to get ahead of this and if you notice

1285
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:47,647
Virus numbers

1286
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:56,095
Thousand confirm I walked in here few minutes ago 24,000

1287
01:01:58,143 --> 01:01:59,935
The internal Chinese numbers that leaked

1288
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:02,751
Ratchet publish in China by the people daily

1289
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:04,799
4000 dead

1290
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:05,823
Yesterday

1291
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:10,431
So what we think they're doing is they're just putting the number of dad is a number of insect

1292
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:13,503
Think about that

1293
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:15,551
So that wasn't an isolated incident

1294
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:22,207
Alex reportedly suggested the China was Under reporting a number of sick and dead because at that point it was in his financial interest to make the viruses

1295
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:23,743
Itself seems as bad as possible

1296
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:25,279
In China is evil as

1297
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:27,327
Like Donna is

1298
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:28,607
Ridiculous he's saying

1299
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:35,007
The China over-inflated their numbers he was the one who did that

1300
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:35,775
Dan

1301
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:38,079
He did it and he only has good ideas

1302
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:39,871
But I guess if he thought

1303
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:41,663
What's that that 24,000

1304
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:47,551
Was actually China reporting that number as opposed to a propaganda narrative that him and his buddies cooked up

1305
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:49,343
Claiming that China's right

1306
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:53,439
I guess that's probably his own Supply

1307
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:54,975
That's nonsense

1308
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:59,327
I have literally no idea what Alex is talking about when he says that the Wall Street Journal admit it

1309
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:02,655
The China lied about the numbers saying that they were higher than they actually were

1310
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:03,423
I think he was just

1311
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:07,519
So I can find plenty of articles that suggested there's a good chance

1312
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:10,591
The China particularly in the early stages under-reported

1313
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:13,407
But I legitimately can't find any credible Source that's

1314
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:14,431
Suggested that they over

1315
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:19,295
Now it's in Alex's financial interest to downplay the virus itself

1316
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:23,391
Open focus on building a narrative the China intentionally built up some kind of

1317
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:29,279
So he's completely fabricating a story about G commanding people to take videos and Wuhan to scare the American

1318
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:33,375
If that was used plan though Alex did a great job of playing

1319
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:34,143
Department

1320
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:35,679
So then he goes on

1321
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:36,447
It's a

1322
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:37,215
Cooked up global

1323
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:40,543
Ordering the Chinese to do this with a man-made virus

1324
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:42,591
Which was a real outbreak

1325
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:46,431
A man-made virus made the real outbreak

1326
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:52,831
That the Chinese gots but it's all

1327
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:54,367
Little chunk right here it's not

1328
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:56,159
Possible for the Chinese to have

1329
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:57,439
Taking a real outbreak

1330
01:03:57,695 --> 01:04:00,255
Well I mean I guess it depends on what you define as a real outbreak

1331
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:06,911
I guess but then it's still just as overcomplicate things and make a manmade virus a real outbreak but

1332
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:12,031
Soda viruses man-made and Alex is absolutely no evidence

1333
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:14,079
That these unnamed Shadow be globalist

1334
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:15,615
Told the Chinese government to do any

1335
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:20,479
Also be bad news for Alex an article recently came out from the Scripps Research

1336
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:21,503
Institute that

1337
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:22,527
Completely ruined

1338
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:23,807
The man-made virus Theory

1339
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:26,623
Christian Anderson the author of the study said quote

1340
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:30,719
By comparing the available genome sequence data for known coronavirus strains

1341
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:35,327
We can firmly determined that stars coronavirus to originated through natural process

1342
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:38,655
They found solid evidence of a natural origin

1343
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:39,935
For the virus

1344
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:42,751
Disqualifying evidence that it was made in a lab

1345
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:47,615
One of the main pieces of evidence on that front was that he's had the virus has a unique backbone

1346
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:54,271
Whereas if someone were trying to create this in a lab they would have to use an existing viruses backbone for the basic molecular

1347
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:58,111
And then they would build the virus from there

1348
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:02,975
They wouldn't be able to do the back going to be able to infect people

1349
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:05,023
Yeah a massive amount of

1350
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:06,303
Research necessary.

1351
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:07,327
Bellevue Factoria

1352
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:08,095
Beat this quote

1353
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:15,775
The fact that coronavirus has its own backbone essentially disqualifies it as possibly being lab-created

1354
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:16,543
And the fact

1355
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:20,127
Is back on his very similar to related viruses known in the wild make

1356
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:21,151
Responsibility

1357
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:23,199
Of it being a product of Natural Evolution

1358
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:24,479
Incredibly

1359
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:26,271
Almost absolutely

1360
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:27,551
Definitively like

1361
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:28,831
Signify

1362
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:32,927
I guess you can believe all these scientists whose articles published

1363
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:34,463
The nature medicine

1364
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:37,023
Journal or you can believe Alex

1365
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:40,607
Extends up to see whatever mood he's in on a given day images

1366
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:42,911
Whatever you choose whatever you want to do there

1367
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:45,983
Cliff is all just made up

1368
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:48,799
At all the little pieces of it and it's

1369
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:51,359
You even like

1370
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:53,663
I found two things

1371
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:54,687
In there that are

1372
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:57,247
Specifically like counter to reality

1373
01:05:58,271 --> 01:06:00,063
I certainly

1374
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:01,087
You know

1375
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:04,927
But their counter to Hughes reality

1376
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:07,231
That's what's so abusive about that

1377
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:07,999
It hurts me

1378
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:12,351
I didn't run all of this made-up ship is in service

1379
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:15,423
Justifying the death

1380
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:17,471
So many people

1381
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:18,751
Potential.

1382
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:20,799
I mean in his mind

1383
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:21,567
They're already done

1384
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:27,967
Because that's what he's saying right there he said people are going to die some young people

1385
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:28,991
They're going to die

1386
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:30,015
And then he goes on

1387
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:33,343
This whole thing so all of this is in justification for what he thinks is

1388
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:34,367
Is already happened

1389
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:37,951
Inevitable which is the deaths of

1390
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:39,487
So many hundreds of

1391
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:40,511
The people

1392
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:42,815
But

1393
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:44,095
That's because

1394
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:46,655
You have to be more scared

1395
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:49,215
About the Great Depression that will be coming

1396
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:50,495
Because

1397
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:56,895
7 million people starve to death during it

1398
01:06:57,151 --> 01:07:03,295
Built to shut down and cower in fear maybe we should rebuild

1399
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:16,095
Yeah the food supply breakdown a depression

1400
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:19,423
Watch The Grapes of Wrath

1401
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:24,287
Major universities again Grapes of Wrath is a.

1402
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:25,055
It sounds right

1403
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:27,871
It's so much of the rhetoric is entirely based

1404
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:31,455
Just on this image of the seven million dead in the Great Depression

1405
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:34,783
Lazy lazy work

1406
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:38,111
So Alex has read an article or

1407
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:39,391
Headline

1408
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:40,671
In foreign policy

1409
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:42,207
That pissed him off

1410
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:49,375
Shutdown

1411
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:51,423
Must be total

1412
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:54,239
Sorry America

1413
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:56,799
Full lockdown is coming this was from a week ago

1414
01:07:57,055 --> 01:07:59,871
Pieology.com

1415
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:04,479
Garrett

1416
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:06,783
Council on Foreign Relations

1417
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:10,623
And she talks about sorry America's over

1418
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:14,463
Sorry again for months and months and months

1419
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:17,023
And yes you're going to have a depression

1420
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:22,143
They all are

1421
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:27,775
That's prop up the Lost Lady

1422
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:30,591
So I read that article that Alex is talking about and it's

1423
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:34,431
Justice Rider posting an op-ed that has the position that people should start

1424
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:36,223
Consider the fact that things make it worse

1425
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:42,367
It'll be wise to observe the examples of countries a little further down the path like Italy to get a sense of what could become a

1426
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:45,695
I grant that some of the stuff is pretty star

1427
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:48,767
And may come off as a little bit extreme

1428
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:53,631
Like y'all were having a saying goodbye to friends for awhile you know like that kind of thing

1429
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:54,655
But where

1430
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:57,471
But Lori Garrett is basically just writing

1431
01:08:57,983 --> 01:08:59,263
It's meant to offer some realistic

1432
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:01,823
Concrete advice for people who might end up

1433
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:02,847
In a similar position

1434
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:04,639
Is people in Italy are in now

1435
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:10,527
Alex didn't look up Garrett and find out that ucfr that's in her bio it's in the article

1436
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:15,391
But Alex Mills to point out that she is a quote former senior fellow for Global health

1437
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:17,183
At the Council on Foreign Relations

1438
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:18,207
Former

1439
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:19,487
Steve pieczenik

1440
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:21,023
Former CSR

1441
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:24,351
I was also left off a few relevant things about a resume

1442
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:26,399
Like how she won the 1996

1443
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:28,959
Pulitzer Prize for explanatory journalism

1444
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:31,007
Covering the outbreak of Ebola

1445
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:33,311
I don't think she has any relevance

1446
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:34,591
Expertise.

1447
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:36,895
Different things to poke Awards

1448
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:39,199
Four books covering Public Health crises so I think that

1449
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:41,759
She's a bit of talk to her on this

1450
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:43,807
I was just making up issues investor

1451
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:47,135
Absolutely no idea who she has Investments and even if she

1452
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:48,159
If he even has any

1453
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:54,303
He's just coming up with a fabricated accusation he could use to tarnish your credibility because that's the level of work that he does in his audience

1454
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:58,143
And I'm going to be I will agree with him this one time

1455
01:09:58,911 --> 01:09:59,423
It is

1456
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:01,727
I consider it to be far more liberal

1457
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:02,495
To choose great

1458
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:03,775
Depressions over Mass

1459
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:05,567
I'm going to go with you

1460
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:06,335
I'm fine with

1461
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:07,871
I am going to

1462
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:09,663
You say that you can paint me

1463
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:12,479
That way if you want to because the opposite means

1464
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:15,551
You would rather choose Mass Graves over a receipt

1465
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:17,087
So

1466
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:17,855
F*** off

1467
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:20,927
Alex is really pushing

1468
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:25,279
Main prongs that ice of his

1469
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:28,095
I want to go back to work minimizing the virus

1470
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:28,863
Narrative

1471
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:30,911
Are the

1472
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:34,751
These are billion people died of starvation in Detroit depression

1473
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:35,519
That's one

1474
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:37,311
Now that the other prong is

1475
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:40,383
Everybody dies from the flu particularly people in Italy

1476
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:41,663
Most Italians left

1477
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:43,711
Haley was I guess

1478
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:45,759
60 million people

1479
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:49,087
60 70 thousand deaths a year from flu

1480
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:50,623
We are three

1481
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:53,439
We have 35,000

1482
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:56,255
Because you made up

1483
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:57,535
It's imaginary

1484
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:59,327
So Alex is talking about

1485
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:00,607
No big deal

1486
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:04,959
The coronavirus right I think it made for a while then you sick for a little bit it's all good

1487
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:05,983
No big deal

1488
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:07,263
If you're not

1489
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:08,031
Super

1490
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:14,431
10-14 Days Inn at exit 79 days while you're sick

1491
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:16,479
And then after that you're not even communicable

1492
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:21,343
People have respiratory issue people have flu they have

1493
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:25,695
Let him die

1494
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:32,351
So I mean Alex has the basic incubation. Correct here and there's some preliminary research showing that you know can laugh about

1495
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:34,399
10 days of active illness

1496
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:36,447
Alex is driving at here is absurd

1497
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:42,079
Some Studies have suggested that you are the most contagious and that. When you don't know you have the virus

1498
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:43,103
When you're asymptomatic

1499
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:45,919
So if everybody follows his advice is only practicing

1500
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:47,967
Some distancing if you feel really sick

1501
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:48,991
There's a really good chance

1502
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:50,783
Completely out of control

1503
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:53,599
The bigger issue I have here is how this is

1504
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:56,415
Complete betrayal of Alex's established narrative about the virus

1505
01:11:56,927 --> 01:12:03,071
He's saying that it's no big deal that incubates for about 2 weeks then you got about a week and a half a sickness and after that it's clear sky

1506
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:05,631
Is a bad month

1507
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:06,399
Call

1508
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:10,239
What are the major consistent features of Alex's contact over the past weeks

1509
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:11,263
But about how this

1510
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:15,359
This is a secret new HIV that the globalist have Unleashed on the population

1511
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:16,127
And part of that

1512
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:17,407
His mind is the even

1513
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:18,431
After you recover

1514
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:20,479
The coronavirus keeps coming back

1515
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:26,367
2.0 Hy-Vee

1516
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:29,439
Everybody's already got it

1517
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:36,607
6 months from now

1518
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:38,143
Tablet

1519
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:45,823
We told you

1520
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:47,871
Probably half now

1521
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:50,943
Everyone's going to get this

1522
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:54,527
You could go hide out in a basement somewhere you're not getting away from it

1523
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:56,063
Because once it gets in the body

1524
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:57,599
The human body incubates

1525
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:00,671
Bioweapon virus

1526
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:01,951
Floats around

1527
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:04,511
Last days even in the sunshine

1528
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:08,095
And it's coming for you

1529
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:10,143
I think this is a serious threat

1530
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:12,703
Penske

1531
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:16,543
If it comes back again and again the person

1532
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:23,199
Wheelies

1533
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:32,927
This is been a standard element of the story about the virus that Alex's used to create the fear in his audio

1534
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:34,463
You can see now

1535
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:38,303
It is no longer useful to him so you just discard it entirely

1536
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:41,631
Which he's capable of doing because he was just making it up to begin with

1537
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:44,703
He doesn't believe any of the shoot he's saying so want something

1538
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:47,007
No longer in his interest f*** it

1539
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:51,615
Hello maybe like a week from now if he wants to he can just be like to keep coming back

1540
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:58,015
Then this what do you think now will be forgotten if you don't work couple weeks

1541
01:13:58,271 --> 01:14:02,367
You're it's incubating you're not even sick right then you're sick for a couple of weeks you know

1542
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:05,951
No big deal then you're fine for a couple of weeks while the

1543
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:07,743
Virus

1544
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:09,023
Germinates inside you

1545
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:10,559
And you're sick for a couple weeks

1546
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:13,119
That gives you 50% of the year that's

1547
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:17,983
Find an that's not bad you could be at the office to keep the economy going

1548
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:22,079
So Alex Goes to cause any takes another call who's dumb

1549
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:22,847
I mean

1550
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:25,663
Article. I was just reading that they were

1551
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:28,735
I have the worst flu season

1552
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:31,551
1st of January

1553
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:36,671
Are they more than normal are there hospitals

1554
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:41,791
New York Times Washington Post Olen January said

1555
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:44,863
In one year

1556
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:48,191
2020 and now we're told

1557
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:49,471
It's Coronavirus

1558
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:53,055
Baba baba

1559
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:54,335
I mean the Coronavirus

1560
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:57,151
Been around forever

1561
01:14:58,431 --> 01:15:01,503
Flu and Corona every year of some others

1562
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:02,783
Coronavirus

1563
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:04,575
I have bad news for The Scholar

1564
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:08,159
The article he's referring to about Italy having its worst flu season in 40

1565
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:09,439
Seniors is from the local

1566
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:13,023
And if you check the date on that article he would see that it's from January 19th

1567
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:19,935
2018 do you don't have to check the dates on it

1568
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:25,567
Approximately 3.8 million between September 2017 and January 14th 2018

1569
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:28,383
This is about where the country hit the peak of a

1570
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:29,919
Particularly bad flu season

1571
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:31,199
North 14 years

1572
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:36,063
And this gigantic number of flu cases resulted in 140 serious hospitalizations

1573
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:36,831
30.

1574
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:41,439
There's another article in the local about the 2019 2020 floozies

1575
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:43,487
20

1576
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:46,047
Report a slightly lower number of total cases

1577
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:47,327
Switch it resulted in 200

1578
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:48,095
40.

1579
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:50,399
These numbers are much lower than expected

1580
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:54,495
Did actual death toll from influenza-like diseases and related

1581
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:57,567
Application featuring Italy but it's legitimately nowhere even

1582
01:15:57,823 --> 01:16:00,127
I'm close to where Alex and is dumb dumb call her suggest

1583
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:05,247
This color has no idea what he's talking about and Alex doesn't either but it sounds good to this new framing

1584
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:08,575
Who throws in his $70,000 a year in Italy from

1585
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:10,879
At Stafford he's falling in love with and now we can

1586
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:13,695
Can suggest to his audience that that Italy's was faking

1587
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:15,999
Toss it into the bowl

1588
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:19,071
Another mixture we're making Jungle Juice Dan right

1589
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:21,375
With all of our Lives Musical bulshit

1590
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:22,911
But

1591
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:25,215
You got to consider Alex's resume

1592
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:26,239
I don't

1593
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:30,847
Thank you so much I have a question before that question I just want to let everyone out there know that there's a new

1594
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:32,127
Infowars

1595
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:35,455
Simple War into this country

1596
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:40,319
Discovered in Garden Grove

1597
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:42,623
The person that exposed iannarino in the Clinton

1598
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:44,159
During the Waco Massacre with

1599
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:46,719
American soil

1600
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:48,255
Clinton Foundation

1601
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:50,047
David gergen

1602
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:53,631
Interview still on YouTube and if anyone wants to see something amazing it's

1603
01:16:54,655 --> 01:17:00,543
When is the Bohemian Grove and then use confronted David gergen and he was completely spooked amazing

1604
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:08,991
We need to get all those famous reports that people don't know about that we're so so revealing and end in repo

1605
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:11,807
Also supposed to go taking off YouTube and I'll get ago

1606
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:15,647
This caller is so indicative of a person who just accepted everything Alex says is

1607
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:17,439
Tristan reality

1608
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:22,047
Alex didn't discover Bohemian Grove there plenty of people who talked about it prior to him

1609
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:26,399
From the mainstream media to a 1989 peace and spy magazine

1610
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:28,959
All well before Alex did his publicity stunt

1611
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:31,775
Alex didn't expose Janet Reno or Hillary

1612
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:33,055
Clinton during Waco

1613
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:36,895
For one that's rewriting history a little bit with the lens of the Hillary obsession

1614
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:39,455
I'm considering it was Bill who's President back then

1615
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:42,015
Just forget about that

1616
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:43,039
Second Alex

1617
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:45,855
Did get a lot of attention for trying to help rebuild the branch

1618
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:50,975
Davidian Church in Waco and it was a huge part of his early identity but even expose anything

1619
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:53,535
Standoff happened in 1993 years

1620
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:55,071
4 oz on the radio but

1621
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:57,887
You know who was on the radio already

1622
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:03,263
Builded punzel episodes about Waco and interviewed a lot of people who Alex uses as big sources

1623
01:18:03,775 --> 01:18:04,287
Linda Thompson

1624
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:06,591
Senator pseudo-documentary the big lie

1625
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:09,919
Alex hasn't broken any actual stories about the Clinton Foundation

1626
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:12,223
A bunch though so there's that

1627
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:15,039
Alex's interview with David gergen is kind

1628
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:17,343
The funny but I don't know if it really achieved any

1629
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:20,671
It's just Alex telling David gergen that he snuck in with a

1630
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:22,463
The camera to Bohemian Grove and Gerke

1631
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:23,999
Call you're supposed

1632
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:25,791
Keep that stuff Secret

1633
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:28,863
How to capture any footage that elicited a response

1634
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:29,887
India Bialik

1635
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:30,655
Wow that's weird

1636
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:33,471
Maybe this would have been a got your moment but from everything

1637
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:35,775
Alex hasn't his documentary

1638
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:38,335
Care if people at the Grove keep what they do their secret

1639
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:41,919
This caller is such a great example of someone who doesn't

1640
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:42,687
Stand a chance

1641
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:46,527
He's willing to believe that Alex Jones is fighting a completely unspecific

1642
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:47,807
Totally real animated

1643
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:49,855
It seems to change their plans based on Alex

1644
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:51,647
Is William super super powerful

1645
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:53,951
To the point of controlling pretty much all the world

1646
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:55,999
Can't seem to handle a dumb radio host

1647
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:56,767
You can't be bothered

1648
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:57,791
Everything pass head

1649
01:18:58,559 --> 01:18:59,327
Is collars willing

1650
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:00,351
Believe that because

1651
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:03,935
He too cannot be bothered to re-patch headlines

1652
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:04,703
A yard

1653
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:07,775
It's a cyclical thing it is it is like sometimes you look

1654
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:10,079
Maybe people are just too.

1655
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:13,407
You know like like as a as a whole like

1656
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:16,223
60% of people approve of how

1657
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:18,015
Trump is handling this s***

1658
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:19,295
Killing us

1659
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:20,575
What is it

1660
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:24,671
But I can't I don't who are these people

1661
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:25,695
It's add stop

1662
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:27,743
But

1663
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:28,767
You know

1664
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:32,863
To dump we're just too dumb or just too dumb

1665
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:36,191
We got to Alex talking about Missouri

1666
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:37,215
Congressman

1667
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:37,983
Congressperson

1668
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:40,287
Josh Hawley

1669
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:41,055
Senator

1670
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:44,127
TJ Maxx

1671
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:57,183
One-sided deal

1672
01:19:58,975 --> 01:20:02,047
Josh Hawley sucks but I'll just still kind of lying about what he said

1673
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:04,607
Corsi's Hollywood on Hannity on Tuesday

1674
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:08,447
Moses call for a turtle investigation into China's actions related

1675
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:09,471
The outbreak

1676
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:13,824
Alex wants the audience to think of this matches up with his narratives about the globalist

1677
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:16,896
Telling China for Elisa bioweapon or some s*** but

1678
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:17,664
It doesn't

1679
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:20,480
Holly's just talkin about the accusation to turn it in

1680
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:23,040
Probably and tried to cover up the initial outbreak

1681
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:27,136
This is basically just a young Republican senator saber-rattling a China

1682
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:28,160
To keep the base happy

1683
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:29,440
Wow also doing

1684
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:31,232
Distract

1685
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:33,536
The fact the party's president has handled this outbreak

1686
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:36,096
Is poorly as one probably could

1687
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:36,864
To be fair

1688
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,400
There is

1689
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:39,680
The fact that Trump

1690
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:41,472
Secretly ordered an emergency

1691
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:43,776
Before you actually did

1692
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:46,592
I forgot about it also Alex's stop saying that cuz he's

1693
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:47,360
Not really in

1694
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:51,456
Interested not anymore it's really kind of falling away

1695
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:55,552
I'll also be millions of deaths it is fake lieutenant-colonel friends told him

1696
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:57,856
Okay there's that talk about that anymore

1697
01:20:58,368 --> 01:20:59,136
You know you say that

1698
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:00,160
Weird

1699
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:00,928
Weird

1700
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,208
Crazy

1701
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:03,744
These these These Times

1702
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:09,632
You know people expect you to remember what happened two weeks ago two weeks ago 6 years ago

1703
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:10,400
Yeah

1704
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:14,496
Is doing is basically change in a whole bunch of like really Central things

1705
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:17,056
15 kind of important

1706
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:18,592
Because drop

1707
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:20,896
That you'd stay in line

1708
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:22,944
But he doesn't just want to defend Trump

1709
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:30,368
Always lying about what's really going on just like they do

1710
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:34,720
I'm going to tell listeners again

1711
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:40,096
You shouldn't take this virus seriously I'm not saying you shouldn't kill some people

1712
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:43,424
Who's telling us what to do

1713
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:49,056
Chlamydia

1714
01:21:55,712 --> 01:22:01,856
Everybody

1715
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:08,256
Once they have their dirty deep State fingerprints all over it

1716
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:09,792
Yuck yuck yuck

1717
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:11,584
Oh boy

1718
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:12,864
Oh man

1719
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,400
We have leaders

1720
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:15,168
In this great

1721
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:16,448
I do

1722
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:17,984
True true

1723
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:20,544
So Alex goes back

1724
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:23,360
Break and take another caller and just call her man

1725
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:25,664
If there is a bad idea this is a

1726
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:27,456
What happened

1727
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:29,760
Justin Washington DC with conservative

1728
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:31,296
Side by side

1729
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:34,880
The Grievances for the Liberty Seas bar on government

1730
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:39,488
Washing down the road

1731
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:44,096
We're going to have to have that March 4th to show we are not afraid we are not afraid

1732
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:45,888
This is not America

1733
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:49,728
America was founded we are not afraid we are not cowards

1734
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:50,752
Event

1735
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:54,848
And the police in military everybody else to join us because

1736
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:57,920
This is a shy off it's all about fear the president said

1737
01:22:58,176 --> 01:22:59,712
The real bad idea but

1738
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:00,992
I

1739
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:02,784
Thought that it was a joke

1740
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:06,368
Cuz I saw some people think that Facebook post

1741
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:09,184
This is a joke I thought it was a joke

1742
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:15,584
Cuz he's supposed like rallies for conservatives

1743
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:16,864
I think that's a

1744
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:19,424
Stupid yeah but this guy's not joke

1745
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:22,496
Okay know which concerns me about that being a j

1746
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:23,520
Yeah

1747
01:23:23,776 --> 01:23:24,288
Yep

1748
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:29,920
But I mean it's exactly what you would expect it's just that the oppositional Defiance in the

1749
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:30,688
The faces like

1750
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:32,736
It's like someone yelling at a hurricane

1751
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:39,136
Or something like that you know it says you can't Million Man March everybody arm-in-arm walking down

1752
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:40,160
The f******

1753
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:40,928
Straight

1754
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:45,024
Another caller who is even

1755
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:51,424
Whipping all over the place just like Coronavirus

1756
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:58,336
I really see that they're trying to shut down Americana trying to shut down the other countries worldwide

1757
01:23:58,848 --> 01:24:00,384
And it makes me wonder like why are they

1758
01:24:00,896 --> 01:24:01,920
Releasing all these inmates

1759
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:05,248
Christine has happened before

1760
01:24:05,504 --> 01:24:06,528
We should have a March

1761
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:08,832
Ruckus

1762
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:10,368
Chaos

1763
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:14,464
Releasing hardened criminals

1764
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:17,280
Not the stop the virus but the crate as much bad one

1765
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:23,424
So this caller seems to think there's some kind of a supervillain plot going on like where the Joker Springs all the inmates from Arkham

1766
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:26,240
Overwhelmed Gotham's Police Department

1767
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:27,776
That's legitimately with

1768
01:24:28,032 --> 01:24:31,616
These idiots think is happening because their world was so based on fiction that reality in

1769
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:33,152
Comic books are in distinguished

1770
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:35,712
I'm going to help this Colorado

1771
01:24:36,224 --> 01:24:38,016
Here's the situation you end up with

1772
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:39,808
When you have an active

1773
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:41,088
In prison overcrowding

1774
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:47,744
You can either release a ton of non-violent and parole eligibility vendors in order to create room for the responsible of ministration

1775
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:48,768
Incarceration

1776
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:50,560
And Health Services 45

1777
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:51,328
Defenders Waunakee

1778
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:54,912
Keep in jail or you can keep everyone in jail and risk horrific on

1779
01:24:56,192 --> 01:24:59,520
One possible outcome is an outbreak spreading in an overcrowded prison

1780
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:01,568
Which attacks really happening right now on Rikers Island

1781
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:04,128
According to slate

1782
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:08,736
Currently 52 people at Rikers who have confirmed cases and 96 more under up

1783
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:09,504
Conservation

1784
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:11,552
There are 5,000 people

1785
01:25:11,808 --> 01:25:12,576
Incarcerated there

1786
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:16,160
And there are the way the Jayla setup there's almost no way to stop the spread of

1787
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:18,976
The spires in such Close Quarters

1788
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:20,000
And the jail was not equipped

1789
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:22,816
You sterilize with sufficient regularity to fight an outbreak

1790
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:25,120
And this is the first time I've ever thought Riker

1791
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:26,656
Bakers Island was a bad bright

1792
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:29,728
Given the situation like that you end up in a position where you can

1793
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:33,824
Can act either by releasing people incarcerated for minor offenses or dumping

1794
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:34,592
A million

1795
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:36,128
Is it the building new housing wings

1796
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:39,200
Something like that or you can watch his prisoners die locked

1797
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:39,968
Incels

1798
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:40,992
You can tell yourself

1799
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:43,808
Imprisoned and they matter less but if you do you're a piece of

1800
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:46,624
18th Amendment does tell you that

1801
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:48,672
3rd president

1802
01:25:49,184 --> 01:25:51,744
Now the other possible consequences an offshoot of this one

1803
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:55,328
If you have a large incarcerated population are being held

1804
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:59,168
Any sorts of conditions or everyone around them is sick and dying and there's a reasonable explanation

1805
01:25:59,424 --> 01:25:59,936
But they're going

1806
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:00,960
Going to get sick too

1807
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:03,264
What's the stop anyone from rioting

1808
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:08,384
If guards get sick to the security staff could be run thin and you might put yourself in a position where there's

1809
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:09,408
Sweet chaos

1810
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:10,176
The prisons

1811
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:12,992
If you care at all about people or

1812
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:13,760
If you're just interested

1813
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:19,136
Keeping dangerous offenders in jail and you're not a dumb dumb the only right choice you can make right now is to

1814
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:21,184
Freeze many nonviolent offenders as you can

1815
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:25,280
If Alex thinks drug should be legal and your other guy was in

1816
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:26,560
In prison for selling weed

1817
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:28,608
Why the f*** would Alex knots

1818
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:30,400
Support letting him out no matter what the

1819
01:26:30,656 --> 01:26:32,704
Santa's or not

1820
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:33,984
He doesn't want a

1821
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:35,264
To appear weak

1822
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:36,288
On the innocent

1823
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:38,080
Dan doesn't want you

1824
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:42,176
Everybody's like all we got to be mean to the guilty let me tell you something

1825
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:46,272
The innocent you really got to take down you got to imprison them for life

1826
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:47,040
Whatever

1827
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:48,576
Also it's not just Bluetooth

1828
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:50,624
Ohio Revised releasing inmates

1829
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:53,184
From Cuyahoga County jail and their Governor Mike dewine

1830
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:58,048
A lot around the world a lot of places are releasing in golf but not in a

1831
01:26:58,816 --> 01:26:59,328
Positive

1832
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:00,864
Like there

1833
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:01,632
Getting out

1834
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:02,912
Through

1835
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:07,008
Combining together their efforts and just breaking free of the f****** prison

1836
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:08,032
Otherwise they're going to kill

1837
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:09,056
So Alex

1838
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:11,104
Do you watch the Hannity

1839
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:14,688
Because he's got a lot of new ideas

1840
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:19,040
And he's going to use a segment on Hannity in order to help him with a sales pitch

1841
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:28,256
Coronavirus

1842
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:30,560
That's right I'm tearing them

1843
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:36,192
Guess what we've been saying on air

1844
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:40,544
0-0 hospitalizations hero

1845
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:47,968
What's on the list starts with a z

1846
01:27:49,248 --> 01:27:49,760
Sleep

1847
01:27:50,528 --> 01:27:51,040
Unbelievable

1848
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:57,952
Typically route is only excited they're reporting on this because it's a way for him to help sell his real red pill supplement that has zinc in it

1849
01:27:58,464 --> 01:28:02,048
The other avenues for a scaremonger aren't as open to him anymore is asbestos

1850
01:28:02,304 --> 01:28:04,352
Protocol really overboard on the sink thing

1851
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:05,632
And honestly like

1852
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:06,400
He can't help us

1853
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:09,216
He has this method of selling

1854
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:12,800
Whatever is the Avenue that's going to be

1855
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:15,104
No Tony General wrote me about the zinke

1856
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:18,688
He might be in a much more defensible place there because there are like

1857
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:20,480
Health benefits of

1858
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:21,504
Taking zinc

1859
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:23,552
Yeah they're not

1860
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:25,856
Solving Coronavirus

1861
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:32,512
97 to 99% effective in killing the viruses

1862
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:33,536
Way overboard

1863
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:37,632
He's going a lot safer to him that a lot of the other

1864
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:43,008
The dick is going the problem is nobody knew what nanosilver was but now that they know exact they'll be like I have it

1865
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:49,408
So the whole story here is the Sean Hannity claimed that he had a letter from a New York Doctor Who said that he had about 500 patients and he cured them

1866
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:51,456
I'm always not just think but also Hydrox

1867
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:52,224
Chloroquine

1868
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:53,248
Azithromycin

1869
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:54,528
Steve pieczenik work

1870
01:28:54,784 --> 01:28:55,808
Exit the New York Hospital

1871
01:28:57,344 --> 01:29:01,696
There's no proof that this is a real letter or a real doctor if there's no proof that this alleged doctor hasn't

1872
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:02,720
In fact you would anyone

1873
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:04,512
Legitimately all be bulshit

1874
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:09,376
But even if it is a real doctor and he has as many patients recovered from this drug

1875
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:12,704
Cocktail it's still not sufficient to claim that the drugs caused the recovery

1876
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:15,008
There could be any number of reasons if they recover

1877
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:16,032
Completely unrelated

1878
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:18,336
The drugs did you need to have much more

1879
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:19,616
Data tobacco

1880
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:21,920
What's up you don't know how science works

1881
01:29:22,176 --> 01:29:23,200
Super Bowl better

1882
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:25,248
Do not care at all

1883
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:27,296
So

1884
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:28,576
Methadone caller

1885
01:29:29,088 --> 01:29:30,624
And I regret to inform you that this

1886
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:33,952
And other day

1887
01:29:34,976 --> 01:29:36,256
Wanted to throw out in this is us

1888
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:39,840
A really radical idea that would drinking bleach

1889
01:29:40,864 --> 01:29:42,400
I felt like I would throw it out there because

1890
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:46,240
Soccer Terry tiller

1891
01:29:46,752 --> 01:29:48,032
ODI l l

1892
01:29:48,544 --> 01:29:49,824
Aart

1893
01:29:50,336 --> 01:29:51,616
Fontana weather

1894
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:53,664
Who is Paige on

1895
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:54,688
On the 22nd

1896
01:29:57,248 --> 01:30:00,832
There is no virus there are no viruses

1897
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:03,392
Experts weigh in

1898
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:05,696
One of them being Jon rappoport

1899
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:13,888
Well I'm not

1900
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:17,984
He's one of the ones that was interviewed on this webinar

1901
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:19,008
There's two important things

1902
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:22,336
Alex does not tell her like this is Ludacris

1903
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:23,360
You don't

1904
01:30:23,616 --> 01:30:27,968
Don't listen to people like that there are no viruses viruses don't exist

1905
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:32,576
You didn't realize this virus denial is a thing

1906
01:30:32,832 --> 01:30:34,624
He is in a position where they

1907
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:41,280
And he responds to work like well you know if you got to have the conversation looks like viruses

1908
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:49,984
Alex wasn't sure if Jon rappoport does believe in virus

1909
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:55,360
Viruses are fake

1910
01:30:55,872 --> 01:30:57,664
That does sound like something

1911
01:30:58,176 --> 01:30:59,456
Who's believe

1912
01:30:59,712 --> 01:31:00,736
Does not know

1913
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:06,112
The beliefs of the people that he promotes his expert want to show up to work

1914
01:31:06,368 --> 01:31:07,136
That's not

1915
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:07,904
Good now

1916
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:14,304
I think that Jon rappoport Spartan that video I was going to watch it but it's really long is just very boring

1917
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:17,632
I don't even know John Rapport is in it but I think he's used as an

1918
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:18,400
An expert

1919
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:21,216
For hiv-aids denial okay

1920
01:31:21,472 --> 01:31:24,288
So I better the section of the rapport

1921
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:25,056
Involved

1922
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,872
Speaking of experts who Alex doesn't know

1923
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:29,408
What they're up to

1924
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:30,688
Steve pieczenik

1925
01:31:31,968 --> 01:31:32,480
Is on

1926
01:31:32,736 --> 01:31:33,248
And his

1927
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:34,272
Main point is

1928
01:31:34,784 --> 01:31:38,112
Basically just to be like him at business is all that matters in America

1929
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:39,648
I agree with Trump

1930
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:44,256
I'm always agreed with a notion that he has the instincts to bring us

1931
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:46,304
Business

1932
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:49,120
Business of America is business

1933
01:31:49,632 --> 01:31:51,168
Snot shot down

1934
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:58,336
Coronavirus

1935
01:31:58,592 --> 01:32:00,640
We are the business

1936
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:02,688
We are the economy in that

1937
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:04,736
And the only thing we have

1938
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:06,272
All of us

1939
01:32:06,784 --> 01:32:08,064
Collecting and finally just

1940
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:08,832
Just being like

1941
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:10,112
Oh I get with

1942
01:32:10,624 --> 01:32:11,648
Guys were doing the whole time

1943
01:32:11,904 --> 01:32:14,720
Man if you go back and you listen to Alex

1944
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:15,488
Jones's

1945
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:21,888
Peace in Richard linklater's Waking Life or he's driving around in the street yelling into a bullhorn about

1946
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:25,984
Humanity is too good

1947
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:28,544
Represent the human

1948
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:29,568
Spirit

1949
01:32:31,104 --> 01:32:33,408
Start 2020

1950
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:40,576
Dick all of those people who are going to create things out of the human

1951
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:41,344
Spirits

1952
01:32:42,112 --> 01:32:42,624
Work

1953
01:32:43,392 --> 01:32:45,184
You got to deliver food

1954
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:46,208
I was just

1955
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:48,000
Talkin about

1956
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:49,792
Corporations

1957
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:51,328
The groceries

1958
01:32:51,584 --> 01:32:52,096
So

1959
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:54,912
Amazon can make all the body

1960
01:32:55,168 --> 01:32:57,984
Jeff Bezos needs to feed

1961
01:32:58,752 --> 01:33:03,360
So Steve his position on this is not based on any science I can find

1962
01:33:03,616 --> 01:33:04,128
Particularly

1963
01:33:04,896 --> 01:33:06,432
He's giving out Sabaton

1964
01:33:10,272 --> 01:33:15,904
Cast of Community

1965
01:33:19,488 --> 01:33:20,768
I can go in and

1966
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:25,632
December or January there's no

1967
01:33:30,496 --> 01:33:31,520
They go to work

1968
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:34,080
I don't think that you should listen to that advice

1969
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:36,384
I don't I don't believe that

1970
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:39,968
Based on any studies already.

1971
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:42,784
That's like

1972
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:46,112
What is referencing is basically how cowpox

1973
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:46,880
Was

1974
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:49,952
Help you grant immunity to small paw

1975
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:52,256
That was that's his concept there

1976
01:33:52,512 --> 01:33:54,560
Whatever he doesn't understand that viruses

1977
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:58,144
A flu is it going to fix

1978
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:01,984
He's going to provide immunity to that they'd influenza viruses a difference

1979
01:34:03,008 --> 01:34:08,128
Amansa same thing with Alex talking about like quinine being help

1980
01:34:08,384 --> 01:34:09,920
440 virus app

1981
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:15,296
Because it solves malaria it's like malaria is not a virus virus

1982
01:34:15,552 --> 01:34:16,832
It's a yeah it is

1983
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:18,880
They're playing real fast and loose

1984
01:34:19,136 --> 01:34:21,184
That's an unbeliever

1985
01:34:23,744 --> 01:34:25,024
Kill Steve

1986
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:26,560
Looks like you just get a cold

1987
01:34:26,816 --> 01:34:27,840
You're cool now on

1988
01:34:28,096 --> 01:34:29,120
Define not going to get it

1989
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:32,960
That means either.

1990
01:34:33,472 --> 01:34:34,240
With the

1991
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:35,008
The world

1992
01:34:35,264 --> 01:34:37,056
Well surgery and public health officials

1993
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:39,104
But that still won't matter

1994
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,896
Because as you said in the past

1995
01:34:41,152 --> 01:34:41,920
Reiterates

1996
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:42,944
He wants them all fire

1997
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:48,576
Some of these people

1998
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:55,744
Some point in 84 got to go

1999
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,584
We don't need I don't need him in the uniform

2000
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:01,888
County Fair

2001
01:35:03,936 --> 01:35:09,824
Bill Barr baby

2002
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:14,176
Months ago

2003
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:19,808
No

2004
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:22,368
That French study is flawed

2005
01:35:22,624 --> 01:35:23,392
But

2006
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:25,440
I love the idea of the first of all

2007
01:35:25,696 --> 01:35:26,976
Steve in the middle of all this

2008
01:35:27,232 --> 01:35:30,304
Just like fire all of them

2009
01:35:30,816 --> 01:35:35,680
We need chaos in the public health battle really Inspire confidence

2010
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:39,264
A first of all the markets and in the population I want to love it

2011
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:46,176
And then also like it was only a couple weeks ago that Steve was on the show and thought there wasn't a Surgeon General

2012
01:35:46,432 --> 01:35:48,480
Get fired

2013
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:50,016
Absolutely

2014
01:35:50,272 --> 01:35:52,320
Surgeon General

2015
01:35:56,416 --> 01:35:58,208
He didn't deposit after

2016
01:35:58,976 --> 01:36:01,280
Steve is not to bring his best

2017
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:04,096
Like I said

2018
01:36:04,352 --> 01:36:04,864
You can't help

2019
01:36:05,376 --> 01:36:07,168
He can't help himself in his sales practices

2020
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:10,496
Is as The Show Goes On he starts to like really push

2021
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:11,776
The idea that is zinc

2022
01:36:12,288 --> 01:36:13,568
It's in his real red pill

2023
01:36:13,824 --> 01:36:14,848
Is a preventative

2024
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:17,152
Preventive effect

2025
01:36:17,408 --> 01:36:17,920
With the Coronavirus

2026
01:36:18,688 --> 01:36:21,760
Scared

2027
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:28,416
What are you do to prevent

2028
01:36:30,464 --> 01:36:32,512
I don't know how much is that is

2029
01:36:32,768 --> 01:36:33,792
Illegal

2030
01:36:34,048 --> 01:36:35,328
But it feels

2031
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:37,888
I mean if if making the claim

2032
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:39,680
What do you think

2033
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:41,472
Yeah I mean like that

2034
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:44,288
Yeah because the issue is like you're not supposed to

2035
01:36:44,544 --> 01:36:45,056
Sell things

2036
01:36:45,568 --> 01:36:46,592
Except

2037
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:48,640
Cures prevention

2038
01:36:48,896 --> 01:36:49,920
Or treatments

2039
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:50,944
I don't know

2040
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:51,968
Let her know it's iffy

2041
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:52,736
Yeah.

2042
01:36:54,272 --> 01:36:55,296
This is the Beast guys

2043
01:36:55,552 --> 01:36:59,392
Like it has to be a thing where I left at the end of all of this we do have to like

2044
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:02,464
Get Alex and Hannity and Tucker Carlson

2045
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:04,000
Like put them on

2046
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:09,888
Mariaville trial actually

2047
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:11,424
Going to get people

2048
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:12,960
Trump already got people

2049
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:19,360
You know like Trump should be in jail I do think that if there is ever like a retard

2050
01:37:20,384 --> 01:37:21,408
Bit of sanity

2051
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:22,944
They should be at least Bank

2052
01:37:23,456 --> 01:37:24,736
Absolutely

2053
01:37:24,992 --> 01:37:25,504
Absolutely

2054
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:26,784
This cannot

2055
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:27,552
Is unacceptable

2056
01:37:28,064 --> 01:37:29,600
So Alex ghost calls

2057
01:37:29,856 --> 01:37:30,368
Steve leaves

2058
01:37:30,624 --> 01:37:31,648
And I hear apps

2059
01:37:31,904 --> 01:37:32,416
The show talking to

2060
01:37:32,672 --> 01:37:33,184
Dum Dums

2061
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:34,720
And this guy

2062
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:36,512
Allegedly has a disc

2063
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:37,280
Distant relation

2064
01:37:37,536 --> 01:37:38,304
Who's a nurse

2065
01:37:38,816 --> 01:37:42,144
And she's treated Corona patients successfully with tonic water

2066
01:37:43,936 --> 01:37:45,472
Map to see if you can keep track of

2067
01:37:45,728 --> 01:37:49,568
Who's this nurse is all right the guy

2068
01:37:49,824 --> 01:37:53,664
If you're giving me this Preamble that's a problem

2069
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:55,968
Friends

2070
01:37:56,224 --> 01:37:57,248
Granddaughter boyfriend

2071
01:37:58,784 --> 01:38:02,112
The boyfriend's mother is a head nurse in a hospital in Austin

2072
01:38:04,672 --> 01:38:05,440
He told her son

2073
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:08,512
Water

2074
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:10,304
The Cure people with

2075
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:11,584
Coronavirus

2076
01:38:15,424 --> 01:38:17,728
Tell us more what she said because that's what

2077
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:22,848
Why not is the ending for it from the British army think of the trip drink though

2078
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:26,432
Sorry forgot Steve was still there

2079
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:27,456
So

2080
01:38:27,712 --> 01:38:28,224
This guy

2081
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:29,760
I've written it down

2082
01:38:30,016 --> 01:38:33,344
Okay girlfriend guys lady friends

2083
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:36,160
Granddaughter's boyfriend's mop

2084
01:38:38,976 --> 01:38:40,512
A game of telephone right there

2085
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:44,352
Obviously he didn't talk to the mom

2086
01:38:44,608 --> 01:38:46,400
I would assume nope

2087
01:38:47,936 --> 01:38:48,704
To the grandson

2088
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:49,728
New talk to the mall

2089
01:38:49,984 --> 01:38:50,496
Maybe

2090
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:54,080
Birthday three daughters boyfriend

2091
01:38:54,336 --> 01:38:55,104
Her grandma

2092
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:55,872
Daughter

2093
01:38:56,384 --> 01:38:58,176
But he might have talked directly to the boyfriend

2094
01:38:58,688 --> 01:39:00,224
Possible so that's still

2095
01:39:00,736 --> 01:39:03,040
Second hand to hand the third hand to Alec

2096
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:06,368
Ridiculous boy that's how I want my information

2097
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:09,952
Kumon my great grandfather's sister's daughter's friend

2098
01:39:10,464 --> 01:39:12,256
Who is a nurse but

2099
01:39:12,512 --> 01:39:14,048
She's been retired for 28 years

2100
01:39:14,304 --> 01:39:16,096
She has a second daughter

2101
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:17,632
Husband

2102
01:39:17,888 --> 01:39:18,912
He's a doctor

2103
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:19,936
And they were

2104
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:20,960
Bright

2105
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:26,080
So are we won last night from 24th here and it's another caller who has cured himself

2106
01:39:26,336 --> 01:39:28,128
Course she had

2107
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:30,944
Kansas Coronavirus

2108
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:31,968
Coronavirus facts

2109
01:39:34,528 --> 01:39:35,808
First of January

2110
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:37,344
I told my mother at the

2111
01:39:40,416 --> 01:39:41,952
I got that Rona

2112
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:46,048
Sober

2113
01:39:46,816 --> 01:39:48,864
And Goldenseal

2114
01:39:50,912 --> 01:39:51,424
Today's

2115
01:39:56,032 --> 01:39:57,056
I know that's what I do

2116
01:39:57,312 --> 01:39:57,824
Oh boy

2117
01:39:58,080 --> 01:39:58,848
Hellboy

2118
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:02,432
Don't they have like a

2119
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:06,784
What's the 5-second delay on

2120
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:08,320
The thing that

2121
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:13,184
It is probably okay about that is that's a testimonial

2122
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:14,720
True

2123
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:16,256
He probably believes it to be

2124
01:40:16,512 --> 01:40:17,024
Pedro

2125
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:18,304
I don't know

2126
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:20,608
Super misleading I do like the idea that

2127
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:21,632
Look

2128
01:40:21,888 --> 01:40:23,936
After six or seven days of having this

2129
01:40:24,192 --> 01:40:25,216
Virus

2130
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:29,056
Fats are I have been told by a large number of people

2131
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:33,152
Can last six or seven days in many people get a minor version of it and then

2132
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:33,920
It's over

2133
01:40:34,176 --> 01:40:35,456
I actually cured it

2134
01:40:35,968 --> 01:40:37,760
With coil silver elderberries

2135
01:40:38,016 --> 01:40:40,064
And it's not like it just ran its course

2136
01:40:41,088 --> 01:40:41,600
I cured it

2137
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:42,624
That's what I do

2138
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:44,928
I'm basically Jonas Salk

2139
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:46,976
I pretty much invented medicine

2140
01:40:47,488 --> 01:40:48,768
So we can do the 25th

2141
01:40:49,024 --> 01:40:50,304
And boy I'll tell you what

2142
01:40:50,816 --> 01:40:52,096
There is a return

2143
01:40:52,608 --> 01:40:58,752
Much like John Cena coming back to the Royal Rumble

2144
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:17,440
We all know

2145
01:41:17,952 --> 01:41:18,720
Roblox

2146
01:41:19,232 --> 01:41:23,328
Hey man you know what what better time to throw out some real racism

2147
01:41:23,584 --> 01:41:24,608
I'm real

2148
01:41:24,864 --> 01:41:26,912
Pointed pointless racism

2149
01:41:28,192 --> 01:41:34,080
It's okay rhyme when stopping at a time when asian-americans are reporting

2150
01:41:34,336 --> 01:41:36,896
Increased hostility and races

2151
01:41:37,152 --> 01:41:38,688
Just abuse being directed towards them

2152
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:44,832
Kimberly grade is Alex taking the time to start his show with absurd

2153
01:41:45,344 --> 01:41:45,856
Race

2154
01:41:46,112 --> 01:41:47,904
Hey there's no crisis

2155
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:49,184
You can't try and turn into a

2156
01:41:50,464 --> 01:41:53,536
So Alex transitions from that pre-recorded

2157
01:41:53,792 --> 01:41:55,328
Fentanyl the Chinese dragon

2158
01:41:55,584 --> 01:41:57,120
Segment into another impression

2159
01:41:57,632 --> 01:41:58,656
Eye of the Mask

2160
01:41:58,912 --> 01:42:02,752
Answer he's doing Bane impression

2161
01:42:03,264 --> 01:42:07,104
Only know

2162
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:10,432
The bad thing

2163
01:42:18,624 --> 01:42:24,768
Stop me to wear one of these put

2164
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:25,536
As BigNik

2165
01:42:25,792 --> 01:42:26,304
A Big Mac

2166
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:29,376
His suit

2167
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:32,448
So Alex leave the show off

2168
01:42:32,704 --> 01:42:33,472
Please finish the impression

2169
01:42:34,496 --> 01:42:35,520
Not f****** around

2170
01:42:36,032 --> 01:42:38,080
That one person that's the whole thing

2171
01:42:38,336 --> 01:42:38,848
It wasn't good

2172
01:42:39,104 --> 01:42:39,872
Was good

2173
01:42:40,384 --> 01:42:42,688
But no f****** around

2174
01:42:43,456 --> 01:42:44,224
And I refused

2175
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:46,272
But has some headlines

2176
01:42:46,784 --> 01:42:51,392
Federal law was overturning of the second amendment that passed

2177
01:42:54,976 --> 01:42:58,048
Newswars.com imports.com you might want to raise the alarm

2178
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:00,096
So these guys the tip of the spear

2179
01:43:00,352 --> 01:43:02,400
Didn't know 4:30

2180
01:43:05,984 --> 01:43:12,128
They live under Cinderella rules of of La like that it's midnight so it doesn't count

2181
01:43:13,408 --> 01:43:13,920
You talkin about

2182
01:43:20,064 --> 01:43:21,856
It didn't change bud

2183
01:43:22,112 --> 01:43:25,184
I wonder what the point of it was so this is just about a 2000

2184
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:30,560
7 release from the national infrastructure advisory Council under George W bush which didn't

2185
01:43:30,816 --> 01:43:33,888
Include gun dealers as essential businesses that should be kept open

2186
01:43:34,144 --> 01:43:35,168
An emergency situation

2187
01:43:35,936 --> 01:43:38,240
I guess it must suck if you're a gun weirdo

2188
01:43:38,496 --> 01:43:42,336
For gun stores to possibly not be open but I don't think that counts as the Second Amendment

2189
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:43,616
Being shut down

2190
01:43:43,872 --> 01:43:49,248
I don't think the second member requires that you be able to conveniently buy a gun at every moment of every day no matter what

2191
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:51,808
It seems like an incredibly weak argument but it's

2192
01:43:52,064 --> 01:43:52,576
Good for Aloe

2193
01:43:53,088 --> 01:43:53,600
Because it helps him

2194
01:43:53,856 --> 01:43:54,880
Pivot the Coronavirus

2195
01:43:55,136 --> 01:43:55,648
Situation back

2196
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:56,672
Familiar water

2197
01:43:57,440 --> 01:44:02,048
You've done the gun paranoia show a million times by now so you should be able to handle that kind of narrative in his sleep

2198
01:44:02,816 --> 01:44:05,376
That's the way you do this this s*** back in

2199
01:44:05,632 --> 01:44:06,912
Into the territory you know

2200
01:44:08,704 --> 01:44:09,216
Got to have a

2201
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:11,520
You know every morning I wake up

2202
01:44:12,544 --> 01:44:14,848
Go check the front stoop and I see that the Milkman has

2203
01:44:16,128 --> 01:44:17,152
Customary two bottles of

2204
01:44:17,664 --> 01:44:19,456
I go down to my local gun

2205
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:21,504
I'm sorry just to get my morning gun

2206
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:23,552
It's like

2207
01:44:23,808 --> 01:44:26,880
A cup of coffee at Starbucks I get a gun at the gun store

2208
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:27,904
And then I'm ready to start

2209
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:31,488
And they really f***** it up when I can only drink coffee now

2210
01:44:31,744 --> 01:44:33,024
What am I

2211
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:33,792
If

2212
01:44:35,072 --> 01:44:35,584
Can't

2213
01:44:36,096 --> 01:44:38,144
Buy a gun at literally every moment

2214
01:44:38,912 --> 01:44:40,448
Then you basically don't have the right

2215
01:44:40,704 --> 01:44:41,728
No he's about return the

2216
01:44:42,496 --> 01:44:43,008
Huh

2217
01:44:44,288 --> 01:44:46,592
At least though at this point the impressions are all

2218
01:44:48,128 --> 01:44:48,640
They're not

2219
01:44:48,896 --> 01:44:53,760
Let me tell you who we have for you on the runs yesterday

2220
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:57,344
Call Joseph Watson

2221
01:44:58,368 --> 01:44:59,904
Majesty

2222
01:45:00,672 --> 01:45:01,184
Island

2223
01:45:01,696 --> 01:45:03,232
Dangers of the bottle

2224
01:45:06,304 --> 01:45:07,328
Rosegal

2225
01:45:08,096 --> 01:45:09,888
Mark randazza and

2226
01:45:12,192 --> 01:45:13,728
Michael Jones

2227
01:45:15,264 --> 01:45:17,312
We got the rest of that list I don't really care about

2228
01:45:17,568 --> 01:45:18,848
At all

2229
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:23,456
I can't even say how little I care about anything

2230
01:45:23,712 --> 01:45:24,736
Don't care about skousen

2231
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:26,528
Don't care about Paul Joseph Watson

2232
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:28,320
Don't care about Mike Adams

2233
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:30,624
Really don't care about Marco

2234
01:45:33,952 --> 01:45:38,560
Alex keeps talking about how like he's coming on because he's an Italian citizen

2235
01:45:39,584 --> 01:45:40,608
I do care

2236
01:45:41,376 --> 01:45:42,400
But you Michael Jones

2237
01:45:42,912 --> 01:45:43,680
Coming back on

2238
01:45:43,936 --> 01:45:44,704
In the middle of

2239
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:46,240
This sort of situation

2240
01:45:48,288 --> 01:45:50,336
Responsible is a bad sign

2241
01:45:50,848 --> 01:45:51,360
There's a bad

2242
01:45:52,896 --> 01:45:53,920
Harbinger of

2243
01:45:54,944 --> 01:45:56,736
Not do so when I heard that I was like

2244
01:45:58,272 --> 01:46:00,320
The Impressions were

2245
01:46:05,952 --> 01:46:06,720
Retired

2246
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:13,376
Their master plan

2247
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:15,680
What is clear

2248
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:17,984
As a clear blue sky

2249
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:20,544
Sounds like him with a mask

2250
01:46:22,336 --> 01:46:25,664
95 masks

2251
01:46:30,528 --> 01:46:31,808
But I'm going to get serious

2252
01:46:32,064 --> 01:46:33,088
I bet you are

2253
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:34,112
How do you get one

2254
01:46:36,672 --> 01:46:42,048
Hey you know empathizing with the the Medical

2255
01:46:42,304 --> 01:46:45,632
Call Stafford on the road

2256
01:46:45,888 --> 01:46:47,168
But it's okay if Medical

2257
01:46:48,448 --> 01:46:49,728
So Alex is now like

2258
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:54,848
Here on the 25th I think you can really hear that he's pretty much fully on board with the idea that like

2259
01:46:55,104 --> 01:46:55,872
All this is just

2260
01:46:56,128 --> 01:46:56,896
Giant hoax

2261
01:46:57,408 --> 01:46:58,688
Play the shop today

2262
01:47:00,224 --> 01:47:01,248
The Democrats

2263
01:47:02,528 --> 01:47:03,296
Lapponian

2264
01:47:04,064 --> 01:47:05,856
Hold America hostage

2265
01:47:06,112 --> 01:47:07,904
They're at work with the corporations to do it

2266
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:09,952
China's opening businesses is

2267
01:47:19,168 --> 01:47:21,472
The governors of the president and Democrats

2268
01:47:21,728 --> 01:47:23,776
Partisan movie shut things down

2269
01:47:24,544 --> 01:47:30,688
Have their own political fever as a Calderon chemotherapy their own radiation

2270
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:37,344
Right now it's showing you my bankrupting you that they're the boss and they think

2271
01:47:46,304 --> 01:47:48,608
Still want something new we start asking that

2272
01:47:51,424 --> 01:47:52,960
Do you know Alex is so full of s***

2273
01:47:54,752 --> 01:47:55,776
What's the new hoax

2274
01:47:56,032 --> 01:47:58,080
He's already looking onto at the neck

2275
01:47:58,336 --> 01:47:59,616
Thing is going to be

2276
01:48:00,128 --> 01:48:00,896
That's

2277
01:48:01,408 --> 01:48:02,432
It's sad

2278
01:48:02,688 --> 01:48:04,224
It is a very sad

2279
01:48:06,528 --> 01:48:07,040
It's

2280
01:48:07,296 --> 01:48:07,808
It's kind of

2281
01:48:08,064 --> 01:48:08,832
It's kind of amazing

2282
01:48:09,088 --> 01:48:09,856
That this is

2283
01:48:10,112 --> 01:48:10,624
Just made it

2284
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:11,392
So

2285
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:13,696
It's like we've got the purest

2286
01:48:13,952 --> 01:48:14,464
Distillation

2287
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:15,232
Of

2288
01:48:15,744 --> 01:48:16,256
The two parties

2289
01:48:16,768 --> 01:48:18,048
Like there's no more

2290
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:19,584
There's no more

2291
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:21,376
Dog whistling her or hiding

2292
01:48:22,144 --> 01:48:22,656
Purely

2293
01:48:23,168 --> 01:48:25,728
The Democrats are evil because they want people to

2294
01:48:26,752 --> 01:48:28,544
And they don't want to reopen

2295
01:48:29,824 --> 01:48:32,128
Two party system is now essentially

2296
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:33,920
Human life versus

2297
01:48:34,176 --> 01:48:34,688
Business

2298
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:36,736
And people are still going to vote for business

2299
01:48:36,992 --> 01:48:37,760
That's why

2300
01:48:42,112 --> 01:48:44,928
You need people like Alex in order to justify those

2301
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:46,464
Those

2302
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:48,512
LL place

2303
01:48:49,024 --> 01:48:49,536
Evil

2304
01:48:49,792 --> 01:48:50,304
Governors

2305
01:48:50,816 --> 01:48:51,584
Geragos

2306
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:52,352
People

2307
01:48:52,608 --> 01:48:57,984
Die

2308
01:48:58,240 --> 01:48:58,752
For Kerrigan

2309
01:48:59,008 --> 01:48:59,776
People die

2310
01:49:00,032 --> 01:49:00,800
So Alex

2311
01:49:01,056 --> 01:49:06,176
Pointed that out and I didn't know what story he was talking about but he has an article that proves

2312
01:49:10,016 --> 01:49:13,088
Dim the whole states hostage

2313
01:49:13,856 --> 01:49:15,136
Coronavirus lockdown

2314
01:49:15,904 --> 01:49:18,464
Is Walter deep state to hold the people and the economy hostage

2315
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:20,768
A depression in civil unrest

2316
01:49:21,536 --> 01:49:23,328
Driving Trump from Office that's

2317
01:49:24,096 --> 01:49:24,608
There

2318
01:49:25,888 --> 01:49:32,032
So that article that I'm exciting as proof that these Democratic Governors on ahold cities hostage isn't an article thing sources are near

2319
01:49:32,288 --> 01:49:32,800
Trail riding

2320
01:49:33,056 --> 01:49:34,848
Infowars.com

2321
01:49:35,104 --> 01:49:37,664
It doesn't embedded video of David Knights episode from that day

2322
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:41,248
Stop proof of anything they get to give their articles whatever headlines they want

2323
01:49:42,784 --> 01:49:43,808
Pretty sad

2324
01:49:44,064 --> 01:49:45,856
Pretty sad here's what I'm going to do I'm going to

2325
01:49:46,368 --> 01:49:46,880
David Knighton

2326
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:48,672
Sure

2327
01:49:49,184 --> 01:49:50,976
A name you can trust salute

2328
01:49:51,488 --> 01:49:52,256
So Alex

2329
01:49:52,512 --> 01:49:53,536
Has been

2330
01:49:53,792 --> 01:49:54,816
Periodically

2331
01:49:55,072 --> 01:49:55,840
Getting a b race

2332
01:49:56,352 --> 01:49:59,936
Yeah we saw there with the fentanyl the Chinese dragon

2333
01:50:00,448 --> 01:50:02,240
Staggeringly race we we see it a lot

2334
01:50:02,496 --> 01:50:03,008
Alex is very rare

2335
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:05,312
But in terms of the outbreak

2336
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:08,384
Like in terms of blaming Chinese people

2337
01:50:09,152 --> 01:50:11,712
Trying to identify

2338
01:50:11,968 --> 01:50:12,992
The virus itself

2339
01:50:13,504 --> 01:50:14,016
With

2340
01:50:14,272 --> 01:50:15,040
Chinese people

2341
01:50:17,856 --> 01:50:20,672
He's just so far beyond like the levels of acceptable

2342
01:50:20,928 --> 01:50:22,464
This is real scapegoating s***

2343
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:23,488
And I don't believe

2344
01:50:23,744 --> 01:50:24,512
I don't believe

2345
01:50:24,768 --> 01:50:26,304
The facts of what he saying

2346
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:27,584
And I

2347
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:28,864
Strongly disagree with

2348
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:29,632
Point of hoodies

2349
01:50:30,144 --> 01:50:32,192
For the breakout happen

2350
01:50:32,448 --> 01:50:34,496
Three months ago there were Chinese everywhere

2351
01:50:38,592 --> 01:50:40,384
In every part of Austin very wealthy

2352
01:50:40,896 --> 01:50:42,432
Very fancy cars wearing

2353
01:50:42,688 --> 01:50:46,272
Very expensive watches carrying $10,000

2354
01:50:46,528 --> 01:50:47,040
Does he do it

2355
01:50:47,552 --> 01:50:51,136
It was a bio-weapon pilgrimage they weren't running from it

2356
01:50:51,392 --> 01:50:52,928
It was their mission to bring it here

2357
01:50:53,184 --> 01:50:55,232
Embassy DC

2358
01:50:59,072 --> 01:51:00,608
The block

2359
01:51:00,864 --> 01:51:01,376
Chinese

2360
01:51:02,912 --> 01:51:06,240
Prove any of that and then also like all the like functional

2361
01:51:06,496 --> 01:51:07,776
Affected

2362
01:51:08,032 --> 01:51:09,056
That can really have

2363
01:51:09,312 --> 01:51:10,080
Is making people hurt you

2364
01:51:10,592 --> 01:51:12,896
He just wrote the protocols of the Elders of woohoo

2365
01:51:15,456 --> 01:51:16,224
Look at all those

2366
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:18,528
Wealthy Chinese people

2367
01:51:18,784 --> 01:51:23,392
Giving you diseases of their evil overlords

2368
01:51:23,648 --> 01:51:24,672
Fatty's

2369
01:51:24,928 --> 01:51:25,440
F******

2370
01:51:25,696 --> 01:51:27,744
You can't you can't do worse

2371
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:30,560
But it's kind of illogical

2372
01:51:30,816 --> 01:51:32,864
Like the place you'd expect this to go

2373
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:36,960
But at the same time I was just trying to balance it with like it's not a big deal

2374
01:51:37,216 --> 01:51:38,496
I don't know

2375
01:51:38,752 --> 01:51:39,264
It's it's

2376
01:51:40,544 --> 01:51:43,360
So Alex has a carpenter friend who w

2377
01:51:43,616 --> 01:51:45,408
Understand

2378
01:51:45,664 --> 01:51:47,712
He doesn't seem to understand

2379
01:51:47,968 --> 01:51:51,040
That carpenters in building is essential

2380
01:51:51,296 --> 01:51:52,064
And it's not

2381
01:51:52,576 --> 01:51:56,672
In the lockdown or whatever little bit

2382
01:51:57,184 --> 01:51:59,232
Struggle about whether or not

2383
01:51:59,488 --> 01:52:02,304
This business is essential any other people were walking off

2384
01:52:02,816 --> 01:52:04,096
The job site

2385
01:52:05,632 --> 01:52:06,144
Then outside

2386
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:07,168
Is this stupid

2387
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:09,472
Houses

2388
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:12,032
The time

2389
01:52:13,312 --> 01:52:14,848
Walked off

2390
01:52:16,896 --> 01:52:17,664
Trenholm

2391
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:19,712
They don't care they're getting into it

2392
01:52:19,968 --> 01:52:22,272
Have quarantined

2393
01:52:22,784 --> 01:52:23,296
You see

2394
01:52:23,808 --> 01:52:27,904
Workers Unite

2395
01:52:30,208 --> 01:52:31,232
These people have Corey

2396
01:52:31,488 --> 01:52:32,512
19 Envy

2397
01:52:33,024 --> 01:52:37,632
I everybody longs to be quarantined at that Concepts

2398
01:52:37,888 --> 01:52:38,400
That that

2399
01:52:38,656 --> 01:52:40,192
The human being would say that out loud

2400
01:52:40,448 --> 01:52:41,216
Oh boy

2401
01:52:41,472 --> 01:52:43,264
That's how Alex Caesar cuz

2402
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:44,032
Use

2403
01:52:44,288 --> 01:52:44,800
A boxer

2404
01:52:45,056 --> 01:52:46,080
So

2405
01:52:46,336 --> 01:52:48,896
I'm Last Days episode Alex talked about Josh Hawley

2406
01:52:49,152 --> 01:52:52,736
And his moves and Alex talked about it a little more here than

2407
01:52:54,016 --> 01:52:55,040
Josh Hawley

2408
01:52:55,808 --> 01:52:57,856
Calls for international probe

2409
01:52:58,368 --> 01:53:00,416
China's coronavirus cover up

2410
01:53:00,672 --> 01:53:01,440
Big story

2411
01:53:01,696 --> 01:53:02,208
Barry

2412
01:53:03,232 --> 01:53:04,768
Dot-com infowars.com

2413
01:53:05,024 --> 01:53:06,560
It's absolutely got to get out

2414
01:53:12,192 --> 01:53:14,496
Companion bill in the house

2415
01:53:15,264 --> 01:53:16,032
Yesterday

2416
01:53:16,544 --> 01:53:17,312
Proud to partner

2417
01:53:17,824 --> 01:53:19,616
For the other Congress people introduced

2418
01:53:19,872 --> 01:53:20,384
This

2419
01:53:20,896 --> 01:53:22,688
Camera resolution calling for China

2420
01:53:27,296 --> 01:53:28,832
Tommy's party

2421
01:53:29,344 --> 01:53:31,136
Unleashed would their Lodge deception

2422
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:37,792
Enemies

2423
01:53:39,072 --> 01:53:41,632
Asurion

2424
01:53:41,888 --> 01:53:44,704
So how exactly would Josh Hawley get damages

2425
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:45,472
From China

2426
01:53:45,728 --> 01:53:46,496
Sovereign country

2427
01:53:46,752 --> 01:53:47,264
Without the exist

2428
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:50,080
Sense of some international governing body that could oversee

2429
01:53:50,336 --> 01:53:51,872
Sea dispute between sovereign country

2430
01:53:52,128 --> 01:53:53,152
Gentlemen's Agreement

2431
01:53:53,408 --> 01:53:57,504
Outside of international law that every country is subject to how does even work

2432
01:53:58,016 --> 01:54:01,856
The very thing that Alex is celebrating his congressperson demanding his legitimate

2433
01:54:02,368 --> 01:54:04,928
Impossible without the very system he's built his career

2434
01:54:05,184 --> 01:54:07,232
Fighting against or you would have to take it

2435
01:54:08,256 --> 01:54:11,328
Right well there's that

2436
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:13,376
This very weird

2437
01:54:13,632 --> 01:54:15,424
Insistence on creating

2438
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:16,704
Cause for war

2439
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:17,472
Without

2440
01:54:17,984 --> 01:54:19,520
Without framing it that way

2441
01:54:19,776 --> 01:54:21,568
Late because it's Alex truly believe

2442
01:54:21,824 --> 01:54:22,848
I understand why

2443
01:54:23,104 --> 01:54:25,152
People die in War I don't understand

2444
01:54:25,664 --> 01:54:26,688
I'm scared

2445
01:54:26,944 --> 01:54:27,712
Viruses

2446
01:54:27,968 --> 01:54:28,992
Can hit anytime

2447
01:54:29,248 --> 01:54:34,368
You don't see them coming and I can't shoot it with a gun start a war Alex truly believe

2448
01:54:34,624 --> 01:54:35,392
That the Chinese

2449
01:54:35,648 --> 01:54:36,160
These government

2450
01:54:36,672 --> 01:54:37,952
Deployed this is a weapon

2451
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:39,488
Sanitation

2452
01:54:40,768 --> 01:54:41,792
Active War it's over

2453
01:54:42,304 --> 01:54:48,448
It's over the Warriors already begun yeah China

2454
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:52,800
And that's obviously not the conclusion that you want to reach but that'll The Logical

2455
01:54:53,056 --> 01:54:55,360
Conclusion

2456
01:54:55,616 --> 01:54:56,128
It's insane

2457
01:54:56,896 --> 01:54:59,968
But I mean that is what he believes he does believe that this is a weapon

2458
01:55:00,224 --> 01:55:01,248
And it's

2459
01:55:02,016 --> 01:55:04,832
I believe

2460
01:55:06,112 --> 01:55:06,880
Released himself

2461
01:55:07,392 --> 01:55:08,416
Do you know it's man-made

2462
01:55:09,184 --> 01:55:10,464
Obama transferred

2463
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:11,488
Precursor virus

2464
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:13,280
Without the Hy-Vee delivery system

2465
01:55:15,072 --> 01:55:18,400
That was a real out right now

2466
01:55:25,312 --> 01:55:27,104
Pontil

2467
01:55:39,648 --> 01:55:40,160
Nope

2468
01:55:41,696 --> 01:55:43,744
Which is The Narrative of success

2469
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:47,328
Nope

2470
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:52,192
Are you in my mind that last one might feel real to you but you got to stop saying narrative when you're Alex

2471
01:55:52,448 --> 01:55:56,544
I would prefer the non-narrative reality

2472
01:55:56,800 --> 01:55:58,336
For the part that's not a story

2473
01:55:58,592 --> 01:56:01,664
Interacting with we need to push

2474
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:02,432
This talking

2475
01:56:02,688 --> 01:56:06,528
Point in order to save our own asses

2476
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:08,320
So Alex now goes

2477
01:56:08,576 --> 01:56:09,856
To his interview with

2478
01:56:10,112 --> 01:56:10,880
Jesse Michael Jones

2479
01:56:11,648 --> 01:56:13,184
Noted anti-semites

2480
01:56:14,464 --> 01:56:14,976
What's fascist

2481
01:56:15,488 --> 01:56:17,280
He is on

2482
01:56:17,536 --> 01:56:19,840
Cuz he made a video about the Coronavirus

2483
01:56:20,096 --> 01:56:20,864
It's very measured

2484
01:56:23,168 --> 01:56:23,680
It's telling people

2485
01:56:23,936 --> 01:56:26,752
Nope

2486
01:56:27,776 --> 01:56:31,872
About to have segments Michael Jones

2487
01:56:32,384 --> 01:56:33,408
Michael Jones

2488
01:56:36,992 --> 01:56:39,040
I want a big bailout in him

2489
01:56:39,296 --> 01:56:41,856
As well. Taxpayer money to police everybody and

2490
01:56:43,136 --> 01:56:44,928
So weird are you got a weird

2491
01:56:45,184 --> 01:56:47,488
Antic anti-semite coming on your show do you start biking

2492
01:56:47,744 --> 01:56:53,888
Complaining about the ATL weird man for his stated goal of eliminating all juice

2493
01:56:54,144 --> 01:56:54,912
What

2494
01:56:55,168 --> 01:56:56,960
Is tolerance if I can't be until the

2495
01:56:57,472 --> 01:56:58,496
So

2496
01:56:59,264 --> 01:57:00,288
Be Michael Jones

2497
01:57:00,544 --> 01:57:01,056
Springs up

2498
01:57:01,312 --> 01:57:04,384
That professor at Harvard Charles liebler Lieber

2499
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:05,920
Who was

2500
01:57:06,176 --> 01:57:07,456
Involved with the Chinese government

2501
01:57:07,712 --> 01:57:08,224
Subway

2502
01:57:09,248 --> 01:57:10,528
Professor and

2503
01:57:10,784 --> 01:57:11,808
I think that there's a lot.

2504
01:57:12,064 --> 01:57:13,856
Details about that story that I don't

2505
01:57:14,112 --> 01:57:18,464
Why I don't I don't know all the details of it's a little unclear I think more will come out over time

2506
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:21,280
Call Jones bring this dude up

2507
01:57:21,536 --> 01:57:23,072
I think there's an interesting difference

2508
01:57:23,584 --> 01:57:25,120
Between how he talks about him on

2509
01:57:25,632 --> 01:57:26,400
This show

2510
01:57:27,168 --> 01:57:28,448
Talks about him on his own website

2511
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:29,472
We've had

2512
01:57:30,240 --> 01:57:32,288
Exposure of certain groups

2513
01:57:32,544 --> 01:57:33,312
In the country

2514
01:57:34,592 --> 01:57:36,128
Send involved in espionage

2515
01:57:36,384 --> 01:57:37,920
In collaboration with the Chinese

2516
01:57:39,712 --> 01:57:42,784
UCI chairman of the chemistry department at Harvard

2517
01:57:43,552 --> 01:57:47,648
Dr. Charles Lieber who was arrested just has this virus started to take

2518
01:57:48,672 --> 01:57:52,768
So on Alex's show this is just a professor who is collaborating with the Chinese government

2519
01:57:53,536 --> 01:57:54,304
You Michael Jose

2520
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:58,400
Makes it sound to possibly more salacious than the actual facts of the case might Merit

2521
01:57:58,656 --> 01:58:01,728
But the thrust of it is just that there's a guy who's collaborating with China

2522
01:58:02,240 --> 01:58:05,312
Maui from his article on his website culture wars

2523
01:58:06,592 --> 01:58:10,688
Lieber who is Jewish was considered a Flight Risk because he has ties to Israel

2524
01:58:10,944 --> 01:58:11,712
Call the authorities.

2525
01:58:11,968 --> 01:58:14,272
The man that both he and his wife surrender their passports

2526
01:58:14,784 --> 01:58:15,808
Libras one of the founders

2527
01:58:16,064 --> 01:58:18,880
Bio-tech firm non-cis which is

2528
01:58:19,136 --> 01:58:21,440
Affiliated with the Hebrew University in Jerusalem

2529
01:58:22,208 --> 01:58:27,584
Lieber being Jewish is very important that you Michael Jones on his website because that's what his work is all about

2530
01:58:28,352 --> 01:58:29,888
Is a gigantic anti-semite

2531
01:58:30,144 --> 01:58:35,776
However to disguise the true intention of his propaganda he leave some of that stuff out when he's talking to someone like Alex

2532
01:58:36,288 --> 01:58:38,080
You cast The Wynette then once

2533
01:58:38,336 --> 01:58:39,104
People come in

2534
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:40,640
Hey see what it's really about once

2535
01:58:40,896 --> 01:58:41,920
They're already ready to hear it

2536
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:43,712
Racism

2537
01:58:45,504 --> 01:58:46,016
Racism

2538
01:58:46,272 --> 01:58:47,552
Pops up real quick whenever there's a

2539
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:49,088
Sure.

2540
01:58:49,344 --> 01:58:51,904
Joey Michael Jones is not on the same page is Alex

2541
01:58:52,160 --> 01:58:52,928
Exactly Buddies

2542
01:58:53,184 --> 01:58:59,072
Kind of on the page of the last iteration of the property

2543
01:58:59,584 --> 01:59:00,864
Francis Boyle who was

2544
01:59:01,376 --> 01:59:04,192
The man who wrote up the antibiotic

2545
01:59:04,448 --> 01:59:06,240
Protocol in 1970s

2546
01:59:07,264 --> 01:59:10,592
Also believes it was a bioweapon that he says that there was

2547
01:59:11,872 --> 01:59:13,920
Back and forth between Winnipeg there

2548
01:59:14,432 --> 01:59:15,968
Level 4 bio lab

2549
01:59:16,224 --> 01:59:17,248
As well

2550
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:19,296
Indication

2551
01:59:19,552 --> 01:59:20,064
Bioweapon

2552
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:25,184
Miss the memo that's disinformation according to Alex

2553
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:31,584
Throw that out because we're more interested in the UNC North Carolina Chapel Hill lab

2554
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:35,168
The pay cards come on man

2555
01:59:36,192 --> 01:59:41,824
The only council is incorrect because

2556
01:59:42,336 --> 01:59:45,664
That narrative might as well be true to we might as well throw it in there today why not

2557
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:47,712
If this information but yeah we're going

2558
01:59:48,224 --> 01:59:53,600
And the only confirm people we have using covid as a bioweapon happened to be white supremacist

2559
01:59:54,368 --> 01:59:54,880
Sure

2560
01:59:55,136 --> 02:00:01,280
It's crazy that he Michael Jones also his big sources Francis Boyle who's the guy who comes on Alex's show

2561
02:00:02,304 --> 02:00:03,584
I'll be working for the same

2562
02:00:04,096 --> 02:00:05,632
Oh well

2563
02:00:05,888 --> 02:00:06,656
It seems like they get the same

2564
02:00:06,912 --> 02:00:07,424
Newsletter of

2565
02:00:08,192 --> 02:00:09,984
So these people like

2566
02:00:10,240 --> 02:00:10,752
Alex

2567
02:00:11,008 --> 02:00:11,776
Cody Michael Jones

2568
02:00:12,032 --> 02:00:12,544
Play just like

2569
02:00:13,312 --> 02:00:14,080
Deciem

2570
02:00:14,592 --> 02:00:15,104
Fairy

2571
02:00:15,872 --> 02:00:16,640
Very

2572
02:00:16,896 --> 02:00:17,408
Willing

2573
02:00:17,664 --> 02:00:20,224
To accuse people of things that cause

2574
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:20,992
Dwarfs

2575
02:00:21,248 --> 02:00:23,296
The thing that's just occurring to me now is

2576
02:00:23,552 --> 02:00:26,112
If the Chinese government is saying

2577
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:27,392
That

2578
02:00:29,184 --> 02:00:30,976
And that they have the right to respond

2579
02:00:31,488 --> 02:00:32,768
Maybe they have responded

2580
02:00:33,536 --> 02:00:36,864
This is what occurred to me maybe New York was a response

2581
02:00:37,376 --> 02:00:37,888
2

2582
02:00:38,656 --> 02:00:42,752
A bioweapon launched by China maybe that's what China did New York I mean it's just

2583
02:00:43,008 --> 02:00:43,776
Speculation that this

2584
02:00:44,288 --> 02:00:45,568
So why are you saying it

2585
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:46,592
I mean

2586
02:00:46,848 --> 02:00:50,176
It look what am I not going to say that we have been fighting a secret

2587
02:00:50,432 --> 02:00:51,456
Biowar with

2588
02:00:51,712 --> 02:00:53,760
China how am I going to not say that

2589
02:00:54,016 --> 02:00:54,784
I know it's

2590
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:56,832
Incredibly irresponsible for me to say this

2591
02:00:57,088 --> 02:00:57,600
Look

2592
02:00:57,856 --> 02:00:58,368
Baby

2593
02:01:00,672 --> 02:01:02,720
But you know what maybe Mexico secretly

2594
02:01:02,976 --> 02:01:09,120
Oh God damn that was a response for the Mexican-American War

2595
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:11,680
Just speculation.

2596
02:01:11,936 --> 02:01:13,728
Make sense that's why we don't have Austin

2597
02:01:14,240 --> 02:01:15,264
They're on lockdown

2598
02:01:16,288 --> 02:01:17,824
Incredibly irresponsible

2599
02:01:19,104 --> 02:01:19,872
So Alex

2600
02:01:20,128 --> 02:01:20,896
And

2601
02:01:21,152 --> 02:01:21,920
Michael Jones

2602
02:01:22,176 --> 02:01:23,200
Are talking about

2603
02:01:24,736 --> 02:01:25,248
Miss Mexico

2604
02:01:25,504 --> 02:01:30,880
Course they are complaining about p****** giving

2605
02:01:31,136 --> 02:01:32,928
Do people in Italy free accounts

2606
02:01:33,440 --> 02:01:33,952
I

2607
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:35,232
Don't

2608
02:01:35,744 --> 02:01:37,792
Understand how we got to where we are

2609
02:01:38,048 --> 02:01:40,864
Here's the thing that's really important

2610
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:41,632
About this

2611
02:01:41,888 --> 02:01:42,400
Trump latest

2612
02:01:42,656 --> 02:01:44,192
The clip their conversation

2613
02:01:44,448 --> 02:01:47,008
You need to understand that there is a conversation

2614
02:01:47,264 --> 02:01:49,056
And then there was a crypto conversation

2615
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:50,848
Simultaneously

2616
02:01:51,872 --> 02:01:53,664
P***

2617
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:56,224
You know where these big you know

2618
02:02:01,088 --> 02:02:01,856
Relationship

2619
02:02:03,392 --> 02:02:05,952
The pleasure of real sex

2620
02:02:06,720 --> 02:02:10,304
It is absolutely not be highly motivated

2621
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:11,584
It screws up culture

2622
02:02:12,864 --> 02:02:14,144
Pornography is a weapon

2623
02:02:14,656 --> 02:02:17,472
I just now being it was been used as a weapon for the pass

2624
02:02:17,984 --> 02:02:18,496
50 years

2625
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:24,128
The main weapon keeping people inside and disoriented when they now her fur

2626
02:02:24,896 --> 02:02:25,408
There

2627
02:02:25,664 --> 02:02:29,248
Because of Marshalls

2628
02:02:29,504 --> 02:02:30,784
Do not have sex with your wife

2629
02:02:31,296 --> 02:02:33,344
So on the surface this appears to be just

2630
02:02:33,600 --> 02:02:39,744
Alex being postponed cuz it has negative influences on intimacy or whatever he's not a fuddy-duddy conservative

2631
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:40,768
But don't beat off

2632
02:02:41,024 --> 02:02:41,536
Whatever who care

2633
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:43,072
However

2634
02:02:43,328 --> 02:02:44,864
If you know what he Michael Jones believe

2635
02:02:45,120 --> 02:02:47,168
This is a deeply anti-semitic conversation

2636
02:02:47,936 --> 02:02:52,800
He believes that the Jews created and promoted pornography as an attack on the non-jewish family structure

2637
02:02:53,568 --> 02:02:58,176
It's a very large piece of his worldview and anyone who's familiar with his work knows this very well

2638
02:02:58,432 --> 02:03:04,576
If you're someone who knows e Michael Jones you hear this conversation I honestly couldn't blame you for thinking that Alex was a

2639
02:03:04,832 --> 02:03:07,648
Agreed with him that the Jews are attacking families with p****

2640
02:03:08,160 --> 02:03:09,696
I don't believe that Alex doesn't know this

2641
02:03:10,208 --> 02:03:13,792
I have a hard time believing you be so oblivious to the people he platform

2642
02:03:14,048 --> 02:03:17,888
Then he be having a conversation about you Michael Jones's exact talking point

2643
02:03:18,144 --> 02:03:19,168
But leaving out the Jewish paw

2644
02:03:19,936 --> 02:03:24,288
This reads to me as an intentional attempt to whitewash anti-semitic rhetoric on his show

2645
02:03:24,544 --> 02:03:30,688
But then again Alex may or may not know if Jon rappoport believes viruses are real so you might be the

2646
02:03:30,944 --> 02:03:32,224
That oblivious

2647
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:38,624
Yeah which is bad because then he's doubling down and signing off on E Michael Jones

2648
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:39,392
Anti-Semitic

2649
02:03:39,648 --> 02:03:40,928
Conspiracy theories about

2650
02:03:41,952 --> 02:03:43,744
I all I'm saying is that

2651
02:03:44,768 --> 02:03:46,560
Baby Italians have a hard time to find a

2652
02:03:46,816 --> 02:03:47,584
But they know p*** when they

2653
02:03:48,352 --> 02:03:49,120
App

2654
02:03:49,888 --> 02:03:50,400
Seen a lot

2655
02:03:52,192 --> 02:03:52,960
Alright

2656
02:03:53,472 --> 02:03:55,776
I really

2657
02:03:56,032 --> 02:03:56,544
Horse

2658
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:59,360
They can't talk about pouring and it's abject

2659
02:03:59,616 --> 02:04:00,384
Certification of women

2660
02:04:00,640 --> 02:04:02,944
And the many women who are f******

2661
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:04,480
Abused in the process

2662
02:04:05,248 --> 02:04:11,392
If it can't include that adult they can take care of they can talk about that stuff but only if the

2663
02:04:11,648 --> 02:04:12,928
The villain is somebody that they want

2664
02:04:13,184 --> 02:04:13,952
To Target

2665
02:04:14,208 --> 02:04:14,976
Can't talk about it

2666
02:04:15,232 --> 02:04:16,768
Its own

2667
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:19,328
Being a bad thing in itself

2668
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:22,144
It has to be used as a as a means

2669
02:04:22,656 --> 02:04:23,168
Yeah

2670
02:04:24,192 --> 02:04:24,704
Asia

2671
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:26,752
So we talk about the stock market crash

2672
02:04:27,008 --> 02:04:28,032
In the falling

2673
02:04:28,288 --> 02:04:28,800
Stocks

2674
02:04:29,312 --> 02:04:30,592
Michael Jones

2675
02:04:31,104 --> 02:04:32,640
Can't quite figure out if it's

2676
02:04:32,896 --> 02:04:33,408
The result

2677
02:04:33,664 --> 02:04:35,200
The virus

2678
02:04:35,456 --> 02:04:36,736
Or the virus

2679
02:04:36,992 --> 02:04:38,016
Came around

2680
02:04:38,272 --> 02:04:39,040
Because they wanted to

2681
02:04:39,296 --> 02:04:39,808
Crash the stock

2682
02:04:40,576 --> 02:04:42,368
You know basically Alex's

2683
02:04:42,624 --> 02:04:44,416
An

2684
02:04:44,672 --> 02:04:45,696
Alex says it's both

2685
02:04:46,208 --> 02:04:50,304
They did the crash on purpose and released of the virus at the same time

2686
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:52,352
Smokescreen

2687
02:04:52,608 --> 02:04:56,192
Which would be actually a martial law consolidation Drive

2688
02:04:56,448 --> 02:04:57,984
What's an office

2689
02:05:00,032 --> 02:05:01,568
I think there's a plausible EX

2690
02:05:01,824 --> 02:05:02,592
Explanation I think

2691
02:05:03,616 --> 02:05:08,736
Not the response I would have! That is nowhere near

2692
02:05:08,992 --> 02:05:12,064
The other assholes

2693
02:05:13,088 --> 02:05:16,416
Sabri have gotten around talking about this

2694
02:05:16,672 --> 02:05:17,952
The virus and

2695
02:05:18,208 --> 02:05:21,792
It's inattentional bio-weapon that or something right

2696
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:23,072
It's muddy

2697
02:05:23,328 --> 02:05:24,608
My lady friend

2698
02:05:25,120 --> 02:05:26,656
Granddaughters boyfriend's mom

2699
02:05:26,912 --> 02:05:27,424
Mom told me that

2700
02:05:27,936 --> 02:05:28,448
It's not about you

2701
02:05:28,704 --> 02:05:29,984
17 and tonic

2702
02:05:30,240 --> 02:05:31,008
So

2703
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:34,080
The last life we have because I'll be honest with you

2704
02:05:34,336 --> 02:05:36,384
Raftery Michael Jones was on Ozark

2705
02:05:37,152 --> 02:05:38,432
The show

2706
02:05:38,688 --> 02:05:44,576
Where this guy wasn't going to come on aboard for the s*** out of me

2707
02:05:44,832 --> 02:05:50,720
21 Mike Adams took over the show cuz I wanted to hear what he was bringing to the table economic

2708
02:05:51,232 --> 02:05:53,280
Talking like you're not the finance brain

2709
02:05:53,536 --> 02:05:56,352
Take all that

2710
02:05:56,864 --> 02:05:59,680
Michael Jones

2711
02:05:59,936 --> 02:06:01,728
It seems like he's saying that

2712
02:06:01,984 --> 02:06:02,496
The virus

2713
02:06:02,752 --> 02:06:03,520
This is an act of God

2714
02:06:04,032 --> 02:06:06,592
But at the same time I thought it was supposed to God

2715
02:06:07,104 --> 02:06:08,640
Bio weapon Chinese

2716
02:06:10,176 --> 02:06:14,528
There have been never been a time when the oligarchs have had more

2717
02:06:14,784 --> 02:06:15,296
Control

2718
02:06:18,624 --> 02:06:22,720
Maybe like that the real message of the coronavirus is it takes

2719
02:06:22,976 --> 02:06:24,512
God's hand to break

2720
02:06:25,280 --> 02:06:30,400
The hold of their hand over all of us are the ones that released

2721
02:06:31,424 --> 02:06:32,704
Using is in God's hands

2722
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:34,752
Bluegrass is rising

2723
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:36,544
That's good news

2724
02:06:37,312 --> 02:06:38,848
I don't understand what the position

2725
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:40,384
Woodforest

2726
02:06:40,896 --> 02:06:42,176
Other than he does not

2727
02:06:42,432 --> 02:06:43,200
In the Jewish people

2728
02:06:43,712 --> 02:06:46,016
And everything is secretly a

2729
02:06:46,272 --> 02:06:47,296
Conspiracy

2730
02:06:47,552 --> 02:06:48,320
So here's

2731
02:06:48,576 --> 02:06:50,368
Play Take on our position

2732
02:06:50,624 --> 02:06:51,136
Insofar

2733
02:06:52,672 --> 02:06:53,696
The Chinese did it right

2734
02:06:53,952 --> 02:06:54,720
The Jews did it

2735
02:06:54,976 --> 02:06:55,488
God did it

2736
02:06:56,512 --> 02:06:57,024
Those three

2737
02:06:57,792 --> 02:06:58,560
Edsby

2738
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:00,608
Like it can't just be

2739
02:07:00,864 --> 02:07:03,424
I don't know man that I am

2740
02:07:03,680 --> 02:07:04,704
Finding myself

2741
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:07,776
Disoriented slightly by Alex's

2742
02:07:08,032 --> 02:07:08,800
Work

2743
02:07:09,056 --> 02:07:11,360
Disorienting

2744
02:07:11,872 --> 02:07:12,640
Yeah

2745
02:07:12,896 --> 02:07:13,408
Yeah

2746
02:07:13,664 --> 02:07:18,016
I understand that there are some thrulines you know like I'm not I'm not going to sit here and pretend that Alex

2747
02:07:18,272 --> 02:07:20,576
Didn't earlier on talked about like

2748
02:07:20,832 --> 02:07:21,600
The

2749
02:07:21,856 --> 02:07:23,136
Causing a financial collapse

2750
02:07:23,392 --> 02:07:26,720
Absence

2751
02:07:26,976 --> 02:07:30,560
Intended a lot of the other elements weren't also major parts

2752
02:07:30,816 --> 02:07:32,352
Of his is rhetoric

2753
02:07:32,608 --> 02:07:34,656
Even stuff that he was talking about like

2754
02:07:34,912 --> 02:07:35,680
Weeks ago

2755
02:07:35,936 --> 02:07:40,032
I like the idea that he'd have Stewart Roads on the talk about

2756
02:07:40,288 --> 02:07:41,568
Virus keeps coming back

2757
02:07:41,824 --> 02:07:42,848
And now it's no big deal

2758
02:07:43,104 --> 02:07:44,640
Do you get over in the week or fine

2759
02:07:46,432 --> 02:07:49,248
I have a real difficult time with it because on the one hand

2760
02:07:49,504 --> 02:07:51,040
You should look at it and be like oh

2761
02:07:51,296 --> 02:07:51,808
F*** you

2762
02:07:52,320 --> 02:07:53,600
But the other hand of like

2763
02:07:54,368 --> 02:07:58,208
I wonder where this is going there's a little bit of curiosity about like

2764
02:07:58,720 --> 02:08:00,768
Red leaves Iran

2765
02:08:03,072 --> 02:08:04,864
You shouldn't be allowed to do that

2766
02:08:05,888 --> 02:08:06,656
You really shouldn't

2767
02:08:08,448 --> 02:08:09,216
He's causing

2768
02:08:09,984 --> 02:08:10,496
He hasn't

2769
02:08:10,752 --> 02:08:12,544
Potential to cause a lot of them

2770
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:15,360
No absolutely

2771
02:08:15,872 --> 02:08:16,640
That study that they

2772
02:08:16,896 --> 02:08:17,664
They did showing

2773
02:08:18,688 --> 02:08:19,200
Pretty well.

2774
02:08:19,712 --> 02:08:20,224
Probably that's

2775
02:08:20,480 --> 02:08:23,296
The more money you have those the Richer you are the more

2776
02:08:23,552 --> 02:08:24,064
Psychopathic

2777
02:08:24,320 --> 02:08:24,832
Your behavior

2778
02:08:26,368 --> 02:08:27,136
This is

2779
02:08:27,392 --> 02:08:28,160
More like

2780
02:08:28,416 --> 02:08:29,952
To me there's something deeper beneath

2781
02:08:30,464 --> 02:08:31,488
That money provides

2782
02:08:31,744 --> 02:08:33,024
And that's insulation for

2783
02:08:34,304 --> 02:08:36,352
Yeah when you don't have consequences for your actions

2784
02:08:37,120 --> 02:08:37,632
This type of shi

2785
02:08:38,656 --> 02:08:39,936
You can this week

2786
02:08:40,192 --> 02:08:43,264
The stock market's up 1,000 points tomorrow it's down 1,000

2787
02:08:43,776 --> 02:08:44,288
Doesn't matter

2788
02:08:44,544 --> 02:08:45,056
No contest

2789
02:08:45,824 --> 02:08:49,152
This week the coronavirus is man-made last week it was

2790
02:08:50,432 --> 02:08:51,200
It's just

2791
02:08:51,456 --> 02:08:51,968
Nonsense

2792
02:08:52,224 --> 02:08:52,992
There's no consequences

2793
02:08:53,248 --> 02:08:55,296
For your actions and so you just keep doing b*******

2794
02:08:55,808 --> 02:08:56,832
And that gets people

2795
02:08:57,344 --> 02:08:58,624
Killed because they have to

2796
02:09:00,416 --> 02:09:04,256
Part of that that is the case but then I think there's also a part that like

2797
02:09:04,768 --> 02:09:09,376
I think Alex is keenly aware of the fact that like he knows he's been lying for years

2798
02:09:09,632 --> 02:09:15,776
Like all the stuff he talks about is like there's no Stakes to it cuz it's not real

2799
02:09:16,032 --> 02:09:18,592
He doesn't care if it's damaging to them

2800
02:09:19,360 --> 02:09:23,200
Don't care it's just like constant b*******

2801
02:09:23,456 --> 02:09:26,016
That just is to facilitate whatever

2802
02:09:28,064 --> 02:09:28,576
Growing

2803
02:09:28,832 --> 02:09:31,136
Narratives that he has out some sell stuff

2804
02:09:31,392 --> 02:09:32,160
And help them push

2805
02:09:32,416 --> 02:09:34,464
Reactionary extreme right-wing

2806
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:35,232
Beliefs

2807
02:09:35,488 --> 02:09:36,000
So like

2808
02:09:36,256 --> 02:09:37,024
Keno's

2809
02:09:37,280 --> 02:09:43,168
On a certain level like every time he yells about school shootings being fake he knows that it's b******* so whatever comes of it

2810
02:09:43,424 --> 02:09:44,192
No big deal

2811
02:09:46,240 --> 02:09:49,824
We're in a situation right now where neither you nor I can

2812
02:09:50,080 --> 02:09:51,360
Predict what's going to happen

2813
02:09:52,384 --> 02:09:52,896
But

2814
02:09:53,408 --> 02:09:54,176
The experts

2815
02:09:54,432 --> 02:09:54,944
The people who

2816
02:09:55,456 --> 02:09:56,736
IR in the field

2817
02:09:57,248 --> 02:09:59,552
That irrelevant you should be listening to

2818
02:09:59,808 --> 02:10:01,600
And they all have dire warning

2819
02:10:01,856 --> 02:10:03,392
The countries that

2820
02:10:03,648 --> 02:10:05,184
Have gone down

2821
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:06,464
The Pav's that

2822
02:10:06,720 --> 02:10:07,232
Alex

2823
02:10:07,488 --> 02:10:08,000
Would like

2824
02:10:08,256 --> 02:10:10,048
To recommend people going down

2825
02:10:11,328 --> 02:10:13,632
Even if they change their path

2826
02:10:13,888 --> 02:10:14,656
Too late

2827
02:10:14,912 --> 02:10:16,192
Are in bad places

2828
02:10:18,496 --> 02:10:21,568
That's not something that has narratives can really do anything

2829
02:10:21,824 --> 02:10:22,336
Think about

2830
02:10:22,592 --> 02:10:23,104
Like he can

2831
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:24,128
Later

2832
02:10:24,640 --> 02:10:29,760
Try and create an explanation like I said like you can rewrite this to be like always mnuchin in the globalist

2833
02:10:30,016 --> 02:10:31,296
That wanted people to go back to work so

2834
02:10:31,552 --> 02:10:32,064
The get sick

2835
02:10:32,320 --> 02:10:33,600
No he can do that

2836
02:10:35,392 --> 02:10:36,672
This is not the same

2837
02:10:36,928 --> 02:10:37,440
As

2838
02:10:37,952 --> 02:10:38,976
Lying about a school shooting

2839
02:10:39,232 --> 02:10:39,744
Or

2840
02:10:40,512 --> 02:10:41,792
Any of the others

2841
02:10:43,328 --> 02:10:46,912
He just wanted to clear it is but it's

2842
02:10:47,168 --> 02:10:48,192
It's not yet I give it

2843
02:10:48,448 --> 02:10:49,984
I give it a week before

2844
02:10:50,240 --> 02:10:51,520
Trump holds a press conference

2845
02:10:51,776 --> 02:10:53,312
Did they beat foutch's head to

2846
02:10:53,568 --> 02:10:54,848
The death because f******

2847
02:10:55,104 --> 02:10:55,872
Severed Pig's head

2848
02:10:56,128 --> 02:10:56,640
I told him it's a good

2849
02:10:57,664 --> 02:10:58,176
It's

2850
02:10:58,432 --> 02:11:00,224
Like that's where is that they are

2851
02:11:00,992 --> 02:11:01,760
It's becoming

2852
02:11:02,016 --> 02:11:02,784
License place on like
