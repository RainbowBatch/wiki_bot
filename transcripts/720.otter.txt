Red Alert. Red alert. Red alert. Red Alert knowledge five Damn, Jordan wedding knowledge party.com It's time to pray. I have great respect for knowledge like knowledge. I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys Shang V or the bad guy Chanology Dan and Jordan knowledge fight need money Andy and Sandy are shopping Andy and Cam handy in Kansas. Andy in Kansas, you're on the airplane for a huge fan. I love your world. Knowledge by now knowledge fight.com

Dan  00:59
Hey everybody, welcome back now. We're gonna do sit around worship at the altar of saline and talk a little bit about Alex Jones. Oh,

Jordan  01:06
indeed.

Dan  01:08
We are Dan Jordan,

Jordan  01:09
Dan Jordanna question for you. So did you pray spot today?

Dan  01:12
My bright spot today is Coca Cola.

Jordan  01:17
It's a great way Coca Cola Classic or New Coke.

Dan  01:20
Look. They have great taste in podcasts. And they decided to sponsor now. Of course, I was notably famously critical of their space flavor. They came out with that space flavor. I

Jordan  01:32
have no concept of a Coca Cola

Jordan  01:34
space. You've tasted it.

Jordan  01:38
Wait, was it supposed to taste like space? Yeah. Okay, that's right. Now I remember. I not memorable,

Dan  01:44
no, and not good. I got the only way I could find that was in like a six pack of mini cans. Right. And they're still in my fridge. No interest in drinking them. They're, they're garbage. But coke put out another flavor called Dream World, which is supposed to be the flavor of dreams. What?

Jordan  02:05
I'm sorry. What are the fuck they're doing?

Dan  02:06
I guess it's some kind of viral marketing campaign. It must get enough attention. Like based on how dumb these ideas Yeah, yeah. Or just like, you know, people talk about like, hey, what's the flavor of space? Right? Flavor of a dri.

Jordan  02:20
You know, I think that's I think they're dissecting Travis Scott's AstroWorld you know, because that's a mixture of both flavor. Yeah, well, I mean, you got a you got space and you've got dream world. I've put them together. You got AstroWorld that makes sense. I think

Dan  02:34
that dream world was much more of a success that okay, it's pretty good. It's it's got like, kind of a passion fruit kind of vibe to it. Sure. Sounds like a Coca Cola mixed with a sort of? Did there's maybe a couple of fruits.

Jordan  02:50
Sure. I mean, let me let me ask you the ultimate question, though, is did they achieve a taste that would remind you of a dream, I guess? world

Dan  02:59
do you dream a passion for? Him? So right on the nose? Okay. All right. If not, then maybe not. I have no interest in assessing the accuracy of these flavors. I will just say that it's pretty all right,

Jordan  03:12
who is the taste tester for dreamworld?

Dan  03:18
Active rapper dream debut that did the dream that he's rewrites it. Yeah. All right. Anyway, I appreciate that the salvage left with a shattered reputation with the dream world. Yes. So what about you?

Jordan  03:33
For me, it's a new album out by J ID. Fantastic album. Excellent album. It's one of those things where, you know, maybe only an outside critic can kind of look at someone and then accelerate it to a high extent. So this is like J ID looked at Kendricks last album. I was like, what if I did the most Kendrick, you know, and like Kendrick can do the most Kendrick kids would say

Dan  04:01
hold my beer.

Jordan  04:02
It's a little bit something that it's almost also a little bit of an O Maj. Combined with a little bit of a parody in a way you know, it's just like he's taken out a lot of Kendrick and really hammering it home like he's changing time signatures every five seconds. He's changed his voices. He's got characters going on. This is Kendrick is shit. You know, that's what he's doing. Right? And he's doing a lot of it right, but it's really good. Okay, so it's great album. All right. That's how it works.

Dan  04:28
I'll check it out.

Jordan  04:28
That's math.

Dan  04:29
I actually can't check it out. Oh, yeah. I've started to exercise again. So I'm listening to a bit of music naturally, and I will say that I'm stuck squarely. showtunes I don't think that would have pumped me up enough. Okay, although I got deep into a I don't know.

Jordan  04:47
Like copy of Mamma Mia.

Dan  04:49
No. One e 10s. pop punk.

Jordan  04:53
Okay, all right. Big fall out. Boy.

Dan  04:55
Some of those hits are better than we remember.

Jordan  04:57
No, they're not.

Dan  04:59
I'm gonna leave it What is a follow up boy? That song from Snakes on a Plane by Cobra Starship was alright.

Jordan  05:09
All right. Go

Dan  05:13
Kiss Me Goodbye

Jordan  05:18
love. All right. Does that does sound like it strikes strikes a chord it

Dan  05:23
will pump you up. Yeah. Anyway, Jordan today we have an episode to go over. And we're gonna be talking I had to take a little break here for damn now I wanted you know, self care comes in all sorts of shapes and sizes and varieties and just I decided today I was gonna go back to 2003 because I wanted to like wanted something of substance to deal with I was it as the the middle of the week was going on just like sick of this bullshit. The I don't know spinning wheels rambling about how there's going to be false flags before the midterm. Sure, sure. She says all the fucking time

Jordan  06:03
I still can't believe he cares about the midterms right now.

Dan  06:06
It's pretty. It's pretty fun. I guess. It's something to talk about short. That's a good point. That is a good boy can only say Klaus Schwab so many times and promote his book so many times, right. Which by the way, yeah. Is out. Be getting that book. Okay, so we're gonna do an episode eventually. That'd be fun. Again, the self care I needed was something with meat on the bone, right? Yes. And so we're back to August 6 2003. That's where we are in our progression through 2003. It's

Jordan  06:35
been a while since we've done 2003 episodes. Long time I scrolled

Dan  06:39
back through the, the episodes and yeah, I'd say more. Maybe Maybe. Yeah. Well, I mean, the trial got in the way and yeah, what have you but I'm very excited to go over this and discuss some of the bullshit that Alex was doing on this day back in 2003. But before we do that, let's say hello to some new ones. So first, Conrad Zimmerman isn't a cult leader, but he does have novelty beverages and snacks. Thank you so much. You're an owl policy wonk. I'm a policy wonk, thank you very much. Next, getting stoned while wandering the canals of Amsterdam while listening to knowledge fight. Thank you so much for now policy walk. I'm a policy wonk. Thank you very much. Sounds great.

Jordan  07:18
That sounds terrifying to in a certain way. Yeah.

Dan  07:20
Next. I don't know why Alex hates Brian Stelter, the stray cat said some great tunes. Thank you so much for now policy walk.

Alex Jones  07:27
I'm a policy wonk.

Jordan  07:28
Thank you very much.

Dan  07:29
I know that I just said that Fallout boy had some good songs so not wanting to talk. I know no credibility in this. But I disagree. Okay, that's very good. It's not nobody's gonna argue. Next to this one late. Sorry about Happy Birthday monkey skate. Love pumpkin. Thank you so much. You are now ballsy walk.

Alex Jones  07:48

Thank you very much.

Dan  07:59
We got a couple of technocrats in the mix. So first, rock and stone. Thank you so much. You are now technocrat and the Necromancer thank you so much. You are now a technocrat.

Alex Jones  08:10
I'm a policy wonk. I have risen above my enemies. I might quit tomorrow, actually. It's gonna take a little break now. A little brachii for me. And then we're going to come back. And I'm going to start to show over, but I'm the devil. Fuck you. Fuck you. I got plenty of words for you. But at the end of the day, Fuck you and your new world order. And fuck the horse she wrote in on and all your shit. Maybe today's broadcast. Maybe I'll just be gone a month, maybe five years. Maybe I'll walk out of here tomorrow. And you never see me again. That's really what I want to do. I never want to come back here again. I apologize to the crew and the listeners yesterday that I was legitimately having breakdowns on here. I'll be better tomorrow.

Dan  09:05
Thank you. Now, Jordan. Yes, Dan, we have an out of context drop from today's show. That's been a little while on this one.

Jordan  09:11
So it's good news. We're getting back to basics. Yes. Yeah.

Dan  09:14
Find finding our route.

Jordan  09:15
Yes, I like it.

Dan  09:18
This is great. Alex has very frequently talked about how big his audience is. That's true. Conservatively 10% of the world at least. Yeah. This This was a new level of brand.

Alex Jones  09:32
Okay. infowars.com Now get 6% of the web's traffic

Dan  09:36
what? What

Jordan  09:39
6% of the tire so there's porn and then there's Infowars and then there's percent or no banking information.

Dan  09:49
Almost one out of every 10 page hits a horse

Jordan  09:56
Wow. Wow. You know when you think about that, you know If you think those Google search results, and they bring back a billion results, you know, in like half a second or whatever, that means that roughly 10% of those are Infowars articles of some sort.

Dan  10:13
I mean, something along those lines, right. I know that Alex says he has a lot of tentacles. And so maybe all of these websites, every porn site

Jordan  10:23
on Infowars Yeah,

Dan  10:25
he's diversified.

Jordan  10:26
Man, that does seem like a backdoor for some enterprise here for Komodo.

Dan  10:33
So let's jump into today's content. Alex starts off the show with a major world news story. And I don't say that facetiously. I usually do. Yeah. Yeah, there's actually a new story.

Alex Jones  10:50
The evidence is coming out that the bombing in Jakarta was another globalist operation. Again, the Saudis are saying the British are carrying out the bombings in Saudi Arabia to destabilize the country so they can create a crisis to offer their New World Order solution. The evidence shows that that is indeed a fact the preponderance of the evidence. New information is coming out about the original Bali Bombing last year, and the fact that the British and US government were there carrying the bombings out.

Dan  11:24
So for some perspective, this episode is from August 6, and the bombing of the Marriott in Jakarta happened on August 5, whoa, there is no preponderance of any evidence that's leading Alex to say it's looking like a globalist plot. He just literally says that about everything. Well,

Jordan  11:40
I was wondering what a globalist plot is in this regard? Hmm. Well, I mean, okay, it's a globalist plot, but what is their plot beyond just decided to blow up this? Oh, okay. Like, what is the plot?

Dan  11:53
So it goes like this, okay. The globalists are attacking sort of Western targets within Indonesia, Hotel chains, right, in order to force the hand of the Indonesian government to playing along with their globalist takeover, right. And crackdown on the public. Install a martial law in Indonesia, because as NGOs Indonesia, so goes the word Well,

Jordan  12:19
I mean, yeah, that is the classic saying the sun never fell on the Indonesian Marriott chain.

Dan  12:26
Yeah, I believe is what it's so that is essentially the plot. Yeah, the plot is to try and force the hand of the government to

Jordan  12:34
gotcha to go along with fascism and will blow up all your McDonald's basically. Gotcha. Okay.

Dan  12:40
So incidentally, these two bombings that Alex is talking about were connected as they were both carried out by members of the terrorist group, Jamal is Islamia, members of the group were convicted of doing the string of bombings in Bali. There were a couple in that in that attack. And it's been pretty clearly established that they were behind the Jakarta bombing as well. One of the more persuasive pieces of evidence that was found was the head of the suicide bomber, which was identified by multiple sources as being a man named as Mar Lawton Sani, who was a member of JDI. I'm guessing Alex could just say that that was planted there or something because he's smart, and he loves facts.

Jordan  13:20
Did you just say what I heard you say? And that's like a we're gonna be fine with that. So the suicide bomber, went into a hotel and blew himself up.

Dan  13:30
Well, I believe it was a car bomb. Okay. Still, yeah.

Jordan  13:35
But of all the things that were intact. His head was identifiable.

Dan  13:41
Yeah, that's crazy, intact. As a way to put it. I

Jordan  13:49
mean, that's insane. That's insane. We're not talking dental records. Like it literally sounds like somebody walked by and they're like, holy shit. It's him. Whoa, how have you been? Oh, no, you're dead. The rest of you is God.

Dan  14:01
Yeah. It was other members of the group who had been arrested identified? Yeah. Yeah. I mean,

Jordan  14:11
listen, I don't want to be morbid, right. Fight. Oh, it

Dan  14:16
is wild. Yeah.

Jordan  14:17
I mean, it is wild. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. No, I

Dan  14:19
don't I don't disagree. That's wild. Yeah. And that's probably why Alex would say it's fake.

Jordan  14:25
Yeah, I mean, that is that is right. Perfect. Dig right.

Dan  14:29
But hey, guess what, if you were gonna do something fake, you probably wouldn't do something like that. Because your response is what people how people would respond to it. Sorry, what? Yeah, it was something a little bit

Jordan  14:40
more. I would I would be very suspicious. Yes. Yeah. So Jemaah

Dan  14:45
islamiah was a terrorist organization that operated in Indonesia and surrounding countries mostly inspired by opposition to the more moderate forms of Islam that were practiced there. This was seen as a form of Western degradation so they targeted thing is associated with the West like the Marriott Hotel in Jakarta and that largely tourist area in Bali, where the bombings happened. Right. The group had received funds from an organization called all Haramain, which is a charity that had clear ties to al Qaeda. Though al Haramain did engage in a bunch of legitimate charity work, some of the funds were dispersed to terrorist groups like Jemaah islamiah, which led to the charity being shut down in 2004. Yeah, yeah. Al Haramain is a charity organization that is based in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The point is that Alex is legitimately just talking shit, he hasn't had time to come up with any conclusions or weigh the preponderance of evidence, but he can't resist the opportunity to blame this tragedy on his imagined enemies and incorporate that made up story into his larger conspiracy worldview. Right. And so he's saying that there's a preponderance of evidence. Right, right. Right, right. Just saying shit.

Jordan  15:54
I mean, I think this is interesting, insofar as it feels like this is one of the few times where the plan in real life has been exactly as bad as Alex's fake globalist plan. How do you mean, I mean, it's just it tactically, I don't think that's gonna achieve what it is that they think they're trying to achieve. You know what I'm saying? Like? No one, no one, no one is going to care if you blow up a Marriott, I'm sorry. I think people did. I think they did. But I mean, at the end of the day, a Marriott is like it's a low level target, you're not going to get what you want out of a Marriott.

Dan  16:33
Well, conceivably, one of the reasons to choose that is that it's frequented by tourists. Sure, and foreign nationals. Right. And it would cause a reduction of Western tourism to the country possible Western influence, possibly businesses would be scared of coming in, you know, there are ripple effects that you could think might be achieved by attacking these Western targets. Right, right. I don't know if I think that the idea is as bad as you are thinking it is. So I respect I respect it's a terrible idea. Yeah, ugly, I can understand the thought process that gets there. Whereas No, globalist plot is a lot. sillier. I think I see

Jordan  17:18
it, I see it. I'm just, this is just one of those plots, ultimately, that has been tried before. And it doesn't really, you know, it doesn't really do it. It's just not how you you gotta get you got to get a good one.

Dan  17:32
Well, hope springs eternal. Yeah, that's fairly say that's fair. So trying to nail down exactly like where this conspiracy comes from, or what Alex is basing this on, we get to one fairly relevant piece.

Alex Jones  17:48
And we had calls yesterday from listeners, several on air, several off air. And a bunch of emails of folks that were watching CNN and Fox yesterday, early in the morning after there'd been a bombing in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia. And they talked about how the US diplomats in US employees had been pulled the pull out for hours before. Well, I had no way of confirming this. I was getting emails, I'll believe it's true. But here it is now, in Reuters and Sky News and in other Asian papers, that of course, the Feds were on the ground within minutes, just like the Bali bombing. But when the Bali bombing two weeks before, they had specifics of the attack, and our government told the Molly's government and told the Taiwanese government, this has been in the mainstream papers like the Straits Times, not to warn anyone not to tell the American people or the Australians or anybody else. The Balis government,

Dan  18:59
I think, is Alex thinking that Bali is a

Jordan  19:01
jado think it is a city state, if I remember

Dan  19:05
province, yeah. Tunisia, but Alex seems to I don't know what he's doing. But so it appears that what Alex is going to do to try and make this conspiracy stick is work with the idea that there was some kind of advanced warning of the bombings and that they were Feds on the ground immediately. As always, this stuff is partially true. There were federal agents there but not us agents. There were two groups from the Australian Federal Police who were working with the Indonesian law enforcement one on a narcotics operation and one on an anti Human Trafficking Task Force. They were able to respond to the bombings in Bali, considering that they were already there in the country. But this isn't suspicious and it doesn't prove anything close to a conspiracy or a false flag. And again, this is related to the 2002 Bali bombings as opposed to the Jakarta bombing that just happened right? That Alex is covered and is a different In Scituate, he's playing fast and loose with these details a little bit and I think it's intentional. Yeah. So there was some advanced warning. But that's not necessarily a thing where it was specific enough to guarantee the ability to stop either the Bali bombings or the Jakarta bombings before they happened. In the case of the Bali attacks, the US have captured Omar Al Farouq who was understood to be a high level al Qaeda operative in the region. His contact information had been found in the possession of number of senior members of the group and after the US forces interrogated him in ways that almost certainly bordered on torture. He talked and explained his role in the Southeast Asians sell of al Qaeda. The US attempted to pass this intelligence on to the Indonesian government because part of it involved a reasonable suspicion that they were planning an attack somewhere near the anniversary of 911. One of the recommendations that the US made was that the government should arrest a prominent cleric named Abu Bakar Bashir who al Faruq had named as being someone who was involved in the organization and planning of attacks. The political situation in Indonesia at the time was very tense with a secular President Megawati Sukarnoputri, who was vice president Hamza Havas was said to have close ties with many of the radicals who the US wanted to focus on, including Bashir. So you had this vice president right on sort of one side of things, as a president who was on the other side is it was like tension, it was

Jordan  21:27
like early America where like it would just be the top two voters get in. So it'd be you know, the this guy and then the guy who hates him the most on the planet is the Vice President and

Dan  21:37
it's a tough situation to navigate right? The country is majority Muslim and Megawati. He didn't want to make any arrests, particularly of religious figures without evidence of their having committed a crime, which the US couldn't provide. The warning that the US had was too vague to be actionable, and the Indonesian government was somewhat in a bind. Ultimately, the Bali bombings could not be stopped, but afterwards, the Megawati government began to act. She arrested Bashir and charged him with a string of church bombings that he had been involved in that occurred on Christmas Eve. Year 2000. Gotcha. In the lead up to the Jakarta bombing, Australian Federal Police were still in the country because the government had asked for their assistance investigating the Bali bombings. In the course of that investigation, many members of Jemaah islamiah were arrested and questioned and a picture began to take shape. That another bombing was being planned, but no one provided a specific target that they were planning to hit, just that it was likely that the group would attack a soft target, right? If that's all you have to go on, you can be on guard somewhat, but you can't possibly deploy the resources necessary to protect every soft target in the country, or even all of them just in Jakarta.

Jordan  22:48
Well, I mean, yeah, it is. It is a warning that says bombing is coming, but without where or what more who or how to stop it. So you're like, Well, yeah, but what do I do with that? Right? Yeah.

Dan  23:02
And the the notion that, like a soft target would be chosen isn't really that much new information or revelatory? Because the original bombing was of a bar, you know? Yeah. It's so then you kind of get the sense that that's in the

Jordan  23:19
the MO Sure, sure. But I mean, even then, that's not really good intelligence there because like, oh, well, you could just be assuming that they're going after a soft target or you don't even really know what a soft target to them quite is how

Dan  23:32
soft is saw exactly. It's tough. Tough to call tough to call. The point here is that Alex just is saying shit. Nothing he's saying means anything and he refuses to take responsibility for the things that he says he just throws shit at the wall and then moves on to another room for anyone can make him clean up his mess. Can none of this is has any connection to the reality of the situation. He's blurring details intentionally or because he doesn't know any better about two different incidents.

Jordan  24:01
I mean, you don't even understand he's he's got people on the ground with the Balis as we speak you know, like he's he's there. He

Dan  24:11
overthrew the Polly's government. He

Jordan  24:13
declared barley its own country. Obviously,

Dan  24:18
Steve is notably part of the barley sovereignty movement would make sense. So Alex has some other news stories he wants to hit on.

Alex Jones  24:27
So remember that article from yesterday on the London guardian. Saudis accused British staff of the stabilization campaign. British embassy staff in Riyadh have been accused by the Saudi Arabian authorities of coordinating a campaign of anti Western terrorist bombings in the kingdom. The Guardian has learned the accusations the British Embassy in Riyadh according to the bombings, he stabilized the Saudi regime is the lightest and most bizarre piece of information who escaped the pall of secret Sheep behind which the Saudis have been conducting legal proceedings against seven Westerners who they say have been tortured into making false confession. So now I said day one before the story ever broke that. It was the evidence says it was the British doing.

Dan  25:16
So this wasn't a story that was in The Guardian the day prior. This is an article from September 6 2002, in the aftermath of the Bali bombing, right,

Jordan  25:25
right, whenever they did note stuff about a thing. Yeah, the basic

Dan  25:29
gist of the story is this. In November 2000, a British citizen named Christopher rodeway, was killed in a car bombing. He was an engineer employed at the military hospital in Riyadh. And in the immediate aftermath, the Saudi government said that this was not terrorism, but it was actually more likely a personal matter. At the time, Saudi Arabia had a public stance that it was very insistent that they did not have any terrorist elements existing in the country. And this would contradict that narrative. So there was an attempt to find another explanation. When personal reasons didn't stick a bunch of employees at the British Embassy were accused of carrying out that bombing with the goal of blaming the Saudi Arabian government. Seven people were held in prison for long stretches treated quite poorly, and a couple of them were actually sentenced to death before ultimately being released. This is a story that Alex is completely wrong about. And if you would just go a little bit further down the story he's using as a source. The credibility of these accusations being made by the government of Saudi Arabia might seem a little shoddy or, quote, a guardian investigation this year discredited the case against the man and uncovered evidence of systematic torture by the Ministry of Internal interior officials. According to defense papers submitted by way of appeal to the Saudi Supreme Court last month and seen by the Guardian, the man was systematically tortured until they confessed, they were subjected to sleep deprivation for up to 10 days at a time suspended from chains hanging from hooks above their cell doors and repeatedly beaten. They were told their relatives would be harmed if they did not cooperate and were offered early release in exchange for confessions. At this point, I want to make totally clear that I'm opposed to this treatment of detainees in the same way that I'm against how the US treated Omar Al Farouq. In the latter case, it was interrogation tactics like sleep deprivation, whereas the allegations in this case are far more abusive and gruesome. The fact remains that these are abusive and unacceptable on both counts. And I'm not trying to minimize one compared to the other or anything. They're both unacceptable. Yeah. Beyond the moral issues, putting someone into distress is not a reliable way to gather information. You may end up getting Intel that's accurate, but you also might not so it's often it's best practice to not view the fruits of tortured interrogations as being trustworthy. So the reason that I gave this much more of a pass in the case of Al Faruq than then in the case of the this they with the Saudi government blaming these British citizens is because there were other corroborating details and pieces of supporting evidence in that case that didn't come from Al Faruq himself, right. And it appears that the things that he told the US forces were accurate,

Jordan  28:07
they did their best to verify that information as opposed to just going, Oh, we tortured him enough that we've got the correct information. Yeah.

Dan  28:16
All that being said, this is all terrible and awful. Yeah. In early 2004, the British Embassy workers who were tortured and forced to admit to crimes they didn't commit on video began the process of trying to sue the Saudi government. The rules at that point in the UK were that you couldn't sue a sovereign government. But their case sought to challenge that law. They actually won a case on this in 2004. But it was ultimately overturned by a higher court in 2006. And so they did not get to

Jordan  28:44
what Hey, what a weird world that we live in, where you can just get swept up into something that has nothing to do with you. And then you're tortured for like, that's how absurd. It is very, very dumb that that just exists. Yeah. And we all participate in this system. Yeah, very silly.

Dan  29:02
Yep. reading some of the folks experience not not so much. I mean, obviously, tales of being beaten and Sure. But you know, the experience of having your government not have your back or feeling like that. I mean, how could you not act? Yeah, it's there's there's some interesting expressions of the the trauma that lingers. That's added to by like, well, there's no recourse. No, there's not really how it is.

Jordan  29:31
It is. It is like a hurricane just swept through your house. And that's it. A hurricane just swept through your house. Now. You have to live with it. But by Yeah, it's fucked up.

Dan  29:44
Undoubtedly. Yeah. So there was something that Alex touched on a little bit. He said that they pulled them out. They pulled people out right? Hours before Yeah, and some of that was not not entirely clear based on On the pieces of information and the sources that he was citing, and so he gets back to that, and there's a little

Alex Jones  30:06
more clarity. Here's another one, US planned withdrawal of Indonesian staff hours before blast. And this is out of the Jakarta news hours before the powerful blast in Bali. Island went off the US had reportedly announced a plan to withdraw its administrative staff from Indonesia for security reasons. You have these two stories interconnected with Bali and with Indonesia, it's the same story over and over again.

Dan  30:38
So this story actually makes total sense if you understand the larger context of what's going on. It's only suspicious if you're only given access to the sparse details that Alex covers on his show. The sparseness of the details is actually a strategic aspect of Alex's broadcast because he's not interested in giving his audience a better grasp of news events. He's just trying to find tiny slivers of information that he can use to make every event conform to his predetermined storyline. So everything fits neatly into the the globalists are behind everything box. This article that Alex is talking about is from late 2002. The context of this is that the US intelligence community had gotten information from Al Faruq and other sources that there was a plan in motion to carry out a bombing in Indonesia, areas or buildings that were seen as Western or prime targets for groups like Jemaah islamiah, so they had every reason to suspect that embassies or government buildings could be under threat. The US tried to relay this information to the Megawati government who found themselves unable to act in it act on it in a way that satisfied us concerns, which left few options on the table for how to proceed. evacuating staff temporarily is a completely justified and rational decision to make in this situation. And it's definitely not caused for any kind of suspicion. Alex is trying to use this sliver of information that the US had considered evacuating embassy staff prior to the bombing to insinuate that they had specific foreknowledge of the attack, but this doesn't stand up to scrutiny. It's also kind of dumb considering that if they did have foreknowledge of the attacks targets, they wouldn't have had to worry about officials at their offices. Yeah, the primary target of that attack in Bali was Paddy's Pub, a bar that was frequented by tourists, though there was a smaller bomb that was detonated at the US Consulate office as well. Sure sure one person there sustained minor injuries, and it happened around 11pm. So most people probably weren't even at that office. According to the Australian police report, the consulate bomb in Bali was packed with shit. So the thinking was that this was less aimed at killing people or causing destruction as much as it was a statement bombing. You know? Yeah, you

Jordan  32:45
fill a bomb with shit whenever you're trying to cover everybody with shit. I feel like that makes up perfect. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, yeah. So

Dan  32:53
this doesn't work, though. And Alex is again, trying to apply it more broadly to the bombing that he's covering. It's not appropriate.

Jordan  33:05
Right. Right. It is he's found places that are geographically close. And then it's been like Well, obviously all bombings happen in this geographical area happened for the exact same reason every time

Dan  33:17
and every detail about circumstances are exactly the same. Right, right. Just sort of transpose things and it's fine

Jordan  33:23
you know, that is that is a really interesting failing that kind of goes under the radar with a lot of his conspiracies like it is impossible to pull off the same job the same way over and over and over and over again like that, you know, unless the other globalist plan I mean, that's that is is it that was too suspicious that they never fuck up in a in like, unique and interesting ways. They're always able to pull it off. Yep. That's crazy.

Dan  33:53
Yeah, it's, it's, no, your enemy is perfect. Whatever.

Jordan  34:00
The enemy of good is perfect.

Dan  34:04
You're just you're making up your enemy. So of course,

Jordan  34:07
right right. Right. Right. Your enemy has the power that you need them to have at any given point in time. It's it's narrative convenience, right? He's got it's like having a main character shield. Yeah, that kind of thing. Yeah.

Dan  34:21
Anatomy shield. Yeah. So Alex goes on to make up more details about this article that I think is just the way he does this is just fascinating. And it

Alex Jones  34:31
goes on. To say yesterday's blast, however, may prove to be just the evidence Washington needed to force Jakarta to come down hard on Muslim civilian grips in the past. analysis did not rule out the occurrence of deliberate violence across the archipelago to provide a pretext for US intervention. Meanwhile, Indonesian House Representatives Speaker Akbar Tong Joon shed that he regret to the US government's decision. And again, it says the US government ordered its employees and embassy staff to pull out of the Marriott four hours before the blast. Very astute timing.

Dan  35:14
So this is a complete fiction that Alex is creating out of this article that he's reading. This article was written long before the Jakarta bombing at the Marriott and had to do with the US threat to remove embassy employees in 2002. Prior to the Bali bombings, the US didn't end up evacuating staff and it had nothing to do with that Marriott, which is the hotel those you know, target in Jakarta. Right. The reason that Indonesian House Speaker tan Jun was expressing regret with the US decision to threatened to remove staff was because he was worried about the message that would send to the rest of the world that Indonesia wasn't a safe place to be. He was concerned with the country's reputation, which makes sense, right? Alex has no idea what he's talking about. He's reporting that the US plan to evacuate staff hours before the bombing that happened in August 2003. And he's sources an article from October 2002. That is an issue. This is the level of work that he does, or at least that's how it appears. Well, I mean, because he's actually conflating sources. Right?

Jordan  36:12
Right. Right. He's

Dan  36:13
making a stew.

Jordan  36:15
Okay. I mean, the whole here is, what amount of US officials were at the Marriott? Like, why are they why is the United States government like specifically like, listen, we, I mean, obviously, it would be like they know that the embassy isn't going to be bombed. But who all was staying at the Marriott that needed to be evacuated?

Dan  36:39
Well, the Marriott the did the host, like some events like they sure had? No, I

Jordan  36:47
mean, yeah, but about a past. It is it is a little bit like the United States government is like, Hey, listen, Eric, you got to get out of that Marriott. I know you've I know you've been stay in there for a week until we find you a place closer to the office. But you gotta get out of there. Eric,

Dan  37:04
we'll see here. Here is where this, this stew aspect comes. Sure. Right. So Alex has this story from 2002, about the threat to remove embassy employees right. And now he's bringing in they're saying that they were told to get out of the Marriott natural which can't be involved with this no article because it's about the US Embassy. Right. So he brings in another article that's a good idea to bridge the gap will not even bridge the gap. He just jams them together. The same thing, okay.

Alex Jones  37:36
Very astute timing. Again, the US Embassy cancelled the booking of Marriott Hotel, four and a half hours before the explosion. US Embassy canceled the booking in the Marriott Hotel. Before the explosion, there was something interesting happening just hours before the explosion shot the JW Marriott Hotel.

Dan  37:57
So this is a bit of a pivot point because Alex up to this point has been relying on this October 2002 article to argue that the embassy was threatening to withdraw its staff. That was true, but he was lying about the context of it and pretending it was a recent article related to the Jakarta bombing right now he's using a completely different source to make a completely different claim while acting like it's the same story. Apparently what happened was that the US Embassy canceled reservations at the Marriott four and a half hours before the bombing. Alex's sole source on this is a translation of an Indian Indonesian website that makes this claim and their only source is an alleged employee of the Marriott who is anonymous. There's no evidence of this, that this is the case. If I were the embassy, and I were orchestrating elaborate fake terrorist plots in order to force the Indonesian government into cracking down on terrorists and going along with my larger global agenda. I don't think I would cancel those reservations, keep them and just not show I mean, it doesn't make any sense. Or even better. Some of the expendable people who worked at the office could show up for the reservation. So then the embassy could apply even more pressure on the Indonesian government.

Jordan  39:06
Oh, hold on. When was the booking for what's up? I mean, they said they canceled a booking, right. But they didn't say there was an event at the hotel that day. They could have been a booking for any time. The

Dan  39:17
implication is that it was like they were supposed to check in four and a half hours after Sure, sure. Or that day or something. Right. That's a great he doesn't say that is a great point. Yeah, then and Alex will play with that a little bit.

Jordan  39:31
Okay, but I mean, it is it is a little bit like if I'm planning a false flag. I'm not I mean, as you said, you know, like, I'm gonna leave those there. What are you gonna say? Listen, we got the if we let it go too long, they're non refundable. Okay, right. We gotta make sure they have a million. Come on,

Dan  39:51
and if it's a bit more the reservations are supposed to start the next day. They have a 24 hour cancellation policy, please. Sure if it's different for the US Embassy Hey, we have a special deal

Jordan  40:01
budgets tight for the United States globalists in Indonesia. It's just they got a pinch pennies, you know? Or if

Dan  40:07
they're supposed to be there like that day. Sure, or whatever. Like, you know, a bombing takes a while to plan. Yeah, you

Jordan  40:14
should know it didn't come together exactly four

Dan  40:18
hours before turn at the embassy. Fuck I keep forgetting I

Jordan  40:21
forgot to cancel it. Oh, damn it.

Dan  40:25
So there's literally only one scenario where this makes sense as proof of a conspiracy. And that's the world where the evil globalist behind this plot canceled the reservation so they could leave behind a calling card for the conspiracy theorists to find. This is basically Alex pretending the information is taunting him. Yeah. Which you have to realize is a part of his the way he viewed her.

Jordan  40:47
Of course, it is it is difficult to keep in mind that he does feel as though he's fighting the Mad Hatter leaving clues behind at the scene everywhere he goes. Yes. Yeah.

Dan  40:57
Like the globalists are the Riddler. They're using puzzles, exactly.

Jordan  41:05
If I figure out all these clues that I'll find the treasure underneath the United States Constitution, it makes perfect sense. And

Dan  41:12
I'm, you know, you and I are pointing out these problems with the idea of them canceling reservations as a silly idea. Yeah. And that's even accepting the framing. They did, in fact, cancel these reservations, which on that day, which I do not know to be true, exactly. I don't think that there's a solid piece of information about this. Yeah,

Jordan  41:34
no, this doesn't it doesn't work if they were there. And they left maybe, but even then, at the Marriott I don't

Dan  41:42
know. That's what Alex says.

Alex Jones  41:45
Saudi Arabians accusing the British government of carrying out bombings to destabilize the region. You've got the US government, with its employees who checked in hours before the bombing, then check out just a few hours later.

Dan  42:04
Alex doesn't have another source. This is just him embellishing and making up details about the idea that the embassy canceled reservations at the Marriott before the bombing, right? The flimsy article that he's basing this on doesn't say any of this, but he can't help himself from escalating things. Now, they didn't just cancel reservations. They were actually there and checked in. But they went through all the trouble to check out hours early before the bombing. Alex's making this up because if it were true, it sure would seem pretty suspicious. I suppose you you even if they were there.

Jordan  42:34
But even then that's like flimsy as shit, you know,

Dan  42:38
but it certainly would raise more of an eyebrow than them. Right.

Jordan  42:43
But now it is a little bit like they check in they they call in and they're like, Hey, can we get an early check in? Because we got to we got to the Marriott too soon. And they go like yeah, okay, fine. We've got a room available. So they go through the whole rigmarole. They've left a credit card and an ID they've done all this shit. They go up to the room, and then like, oh, fuck, I forgot. We got the bomb. Today. They run down there. They have to make a fake scene, they have to make a big scene. Oh, my room wasn't as clean as it needed to be, how dare users, I demand a refund and then they leave.

Dan  43:15
It's conceivably the dumbest track of events. I actually believe that. It's not great Oh, one would go through this. It's absurd. But here's the thing. Like basically Alex can't make compelling arguments based on the information that's available. So you're cheating by just making up shit that makes his case look stronger. He's doing this because he's a liar. Right? It does. Right? Because once you establish the idea that you had these embassy people there, who checked out and you add it to believing the Saudi Arabian government, about the British folks who were carrying out bombings to destabilize the Saudi Arabian government, right, you can combine this all together, and now you have a hit team was at the Marriott

Alex Jones  44:03
All right. Turns out the government had inserted a team of what looks like 20 people or more what? Into this Marriott. They came out just a few hours before the blast and maybe just a coincidence. They just so happened to pull them out and they were going to be there for two more days. Wait, how do you know that mount because of the threat that's happening. And of course, it turns out that the Bali bombing, they told the Taiwanese not to warn the Balis government about the bombing.

Dan  44:37
You can see here Alex is building out the story. He has a flimsy source that claims that the US Embassy canceled reservations hours before the bombing took place at the Marriott which he is now reporting as the US sending in a team of about 20 people who are pulled out early Yeah, this is solely from his own imagination. And it's nothing more than him writing his own little story about this tragic event so he can use it to further his own goals. One thing I want to draw special attention to is the part where he says that they were pulled out of the hotel because of threats. This is important because it's a synthesis of this flimsy source about the canceled hotel reservation and that article from 2002, about the lead up to the Bali bombing, Alex's taking the hotel detail from one story in mashing it up with the embassy being concerned about threats, that detail from the other story, and then serving it up for the audience as if it's something meaningful. And it's the same thing. If anything, this is an abuse of information. And it's kind of silly to pretend that what he's doing is questioning world events. Yeah, this isn't questioning this is just lying about shitshow mass casualty events can be incorporated into your worldview more easily, and you can profit off

Jordan  45:42
them. Right. Right. And is it is funny that I like throughout this entire time I find myself trying to give advice to the globalists, and then realizing again that what I'm really doing is just in a writers room with Alex trying to punch up his narrative. Yeah, you know, like, I think a team of 20 is too big. It's too many people are gonna, that's, that's too big. It's too obvious to see. And then I realized I'm not I'm not talking about this. I'm with Alex being like, Okay, listen, we got to do took that from

Dan  46:11
the article about the canceled reservations that allege that there were 10 to 20 rooms, right. So that's just a number that he's coming up. Yeah,

Jordan  46:18
why not?

Dan  46:19
The reservation was apparently for three days, although it doesn't specify which three days. And so that's where he's getting the two more days thing. Sure. But he's just, he's just cracking those details into his own form, whatever shape he wants them to take in order to make his story make sense. Now, what I think is more interesting with your writerly instincts, is the way that you have been one step ahead of our narrative, right with the like,

Jordan  46:44
here's how you got to

Dan  46:47
know well,

Jordan  46:49
that is interesting about going back to the past, he does have those abilities, it does feel like he's building something,

Dan  46:54
there is a little bit of an A to B to C with the way that the the layers of the conspiracy are added on as he makes stuff up about, like, the little kernel that is at the base of this feels like he's trying. Yeah, it's not good.

Jordan  47:11
I mean, no, it's for No, but it is an effort, which we're not used to seeing in the present Holy

Dan  47:16
shit. It's, it's transparent if you take the time to pay attention to it. But if you don't, or if you just operate off headlines, and the optics of seeing a headline that says US Embassy, canceled reservation, right, four and a half hours before bombing, right, and then you accept whatever Alex says about it. Like if you just accept the story that he tells about that headline? Sure. The escalation of it does make sense. Or if you believe the Saudi government about the British embassy employees, that they tortured and got false confessions outright, these things. Yeah, there is a conspiracy that is crafted.

Jordan  47:58
It's a little bit like a kid improving a book report where you're like, Okay, I know you didn't read that book. But I'm actually kind of respecting your level of creativity and faking that you read that book, you're making up some fun shit. Sure.

Dan  48:11
It's like if a kid improvised a book report that was super disrespectful to a bunch of people who died a bomb. Right,

Jordan  48:17
right. Yeah, that would be Where the Red Fern Grows, is actually the Civil War burial ground? Yeah, that's a really worse book.

Dan  48:27
So Alex doesn't just stay on this topic, all episode. He also just yells about stuff to share.

Alex Jones  48:34
Its death squads, folks. And that's what Homeland Security in the National Police are. That's what the SWAT teams are. They're setting up death squads in America. It's in Patriot Act, wanting to be able to come and kill you and never even tell people why they killed you never charge you never indict you never arrest you. I mean, this is textbook classical tyranny. We're gonna take calls and I got a bunch of other news, we're gonna get to toll free number to join us.

Dan  49:03
So that's a little severe. Yeah. I think that you could make an interesting argument that in some ways, the police are acting as not always but sometimes do operate as a death squad. I mean, I think that's not what Alex is talking about. No, Alex doesn't seem to really have that much problem with police brutality. That's kind of the issue. So it's it rings a little hollow.

Jordan  49:28
I mean, if you are putting together and Alex Jones was right clip I don't understand why that's not on there. Unless because Alex, it doesn't work and the President for his

Dan  49:38
own that narrative in the past late Exactly. And it's not it's not worthwhile for him to to really hang his hat on

Jordan  49:44
can't go back to Tality. Not now. No, no, too late. You

Dan  49:47
have to defend too many people on the left. Yeah, he can't do that. Nope,

Jordan  49:51
nope. He has to literally be above the left right paradigm in order to do that. And he's absolutely not the Yep.

Dan  49:59
So I'm in this next clip, Alex goes to calls. And unfortunately, a caller asks a question that Alex was not prepared for.

Unknown Speaker  50:08
What does VA RPA stand for?

Alex Jones  50:11
It's the advanced. I've got to dig it out. But it's the advanced military research system. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  50:20
Thank you very much.

Alex Jones  50:21
You bet. It starts. When you hear somebody talk about DARPA, they start with advanced they never put it but it's the Defense Advanced Research. Agency. There you go. Forgot the

Dan  50:35
P. The one of the things I thought was really interesting about that, first of all, that was not a gotcha question. The caller was not trying to stump him. He was just, he was interested. Yeah. Alex should know that. The thing the thing that stuck out in my mind was that like on the stand, in Alex's case, when Daria was testifying, they asked her what DARPA stands for. He

Jordan  50:56
knew. Yeah, that is true. That is funny

Dan  50:59
that in 2003, Alex would fumble around with what is DARPA stands

Jordan  51:04
for? Yeah, that's weird. If that way, if that was scripts, he would have heard that doing real fast. I underslept DARPA stand for advanced.

Dan  51:14
I understand if he would have trouble with like harp. Sure. He doesn't talk about harp that much. I don't know if that has come out. But DARPA is like, and he's in the middle of like this. I mean, it's been a while since we've done 2003 episodes. Yeah. But he just had that whole thing about how they were trying to gamble on terrorist attacks and stuff. Yeah, set up a stock market on deaths. So it's, it's it's pretty front and center of his narratives. Yeah, you should not be

Jordan  51:41
a conspiracy theorist. You should have DARPA on the ready. On his back foot. Yeah. If you're a math teacher, you have to be able to do long division in your head like you have to you can't fumble around with that shit. Otherwise, no one respects you.

Dan  51:53
So Alex, take some other call. And this is the level of discourse that's going on on the show, man, it's heavy stuff. Okay.

Caller 1 (720)  52:00
I want to get your opinion on a couple of things. It's reading that on August 27. Mars is going to be closest to the earth and 60,000 years.

Alex Jones  52:12
Yeah, it's gonna be the closest to Earth and 60,000 years and now

Unknown Speaker  52:15
we know let's use globalists or into the call as one we do know that opinion about if that has any significance are now

Alex Jones  52:24
absolutely I don't believe in astrology I don't believe in in quackery. But the globalist Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, Bush Clinton, they got shamans they're doing seances there. They admit they they run off of astrology. Exactly. with it and I keep meaning to measure this. I'm glad you brought it up with with with Mars, the closest it'll be in 60,000 years. That's an human conscious reflection. In 60,000 years, these guys are totally obsessed with numerology. You know what that portends? The astrology. And that's why they're moving so hard and it is very dangerous. Go ahead.

Unknown Speaker  53:15
And do you think that they would celebrate that day with another attack? I mean, is that, but you need to be looking at Oh,

Alex Jones  53:24
make predictions on things like that when I don't have enough data. But I have to admit that reading about it and then saying over the last year that we've been worried about August 24, when it will be the closest to Earth has been in 60,000 years. Okay.

Dan  53:39
All right. That is amazing. I don't make those kinds of predictions. But I mean,

Jordan  53:43
look, that's amazing. That is amazing to go from not knowing a thing to suddenly just being like this thing is central. We're terrified. Oh, is that true?

Dan  53:57
I'm crunching the numbers. There's a preponderance of evidence bars is gonna be the God of War

Jordan  54:05
was it? Was it I just

Dan  54:12
was simply that is true. That was it was an event that did happen right.

Jordan  54:17
I just appreciate that instantaneous. Absolutely. Yeah. Is that something we should worry about? Absolutely. You bet brother.

Dan  54:26
Just fill in the blank. If there is something you're asking Alex if you should be worried about it absolutely. Nailed there is a reason to be afraid you. You're

Jordan  54:37
not crazy for having this fear of something that nobody has literally ever thought before. You are right my friend. Let's

Dan  54:43
kill minutes of valuable time on my show. Talking about being worried about Mars being close. I don't know bliss celebrating. Celebrating one. Mars being close.

Jordan  54:56
That's another problem here. You didn't explain how this is related to a difficult situation. Like Oh, I bet because why this bars is close this time they're gonna be like this is important.

Dan  55:10
I'm hearing the words you're saying, but you sound dumb. It makes so much sense. Just it. Really, really. You marked you reveal yourself to be a mark when you ask questions like that. Like, it's just understood that the globalists bomb things when planets are close.

Jordan  55:31
How much closer? Oh, much closer. Couldn't be that much. It's not like a million miles closer on this one day. It was pretty.

Dan  55:42
I think it was quite a bit closer. Much closer. I don't know. I don't remember I looked it up. But I don't I don't remember the exact right right. I did look up if there was any bombing on, Sheriff. Well, you had to the Little League World Series to place maybe some balls? Yeah, maybe

Jordan  55:59
so homeruns are hit that shouldn't unnecessarily made it out. Yeah.

Dan  56:03
applicational pull of those right over the rafters but

Jordan  56:07
check power got got a little bit stronger. Yeah.

Dan  56:11
I mean, look, this is just dumb. But yeah, it's interesting that you have that response of like, Why do you even would you why would that even be something that the globalists are interested in? Because to me, I mean, I'm joking around scolding you, or like making fun of you, but like, to me it is like, I'm external. So

Jordan  56:30
it's just a little bit closer. Yeah. But to me

Dan  56:33
that there's magical powers.

Jordan  56:36
Okay. But if that's the case, then it suggests that as the moon as Mars gets further away, something else changes that makes you less likely to celebrate, right? It being further away than Venus gets? Or is it just like, is it just a day? Is it just like, oh, this is a it's like a solar eclipse. They all go outside? They look up and they're like, Oh, look at that. And then they go back to their lives?

Dan  57:00
Well, they can see a solar eclipse and then they got a bomb. Got it?

Jordan  57:05
That's right, you're right. Yeah, you just it is it is so much. You're cavemen just like anything is aside just like, oh, there's a shooting set. That's aside. Oh, there's about Mars is a little close. That's aside, it is such that it is just caveman thought. That's all it is. Well, and

Dan  57:22
Alex takes, like, the kind of a simplistic understanding of symbolism occultism and, and just applies it sort of universally, right? So anything that seems like it could be like an equinox or something. Anytime there's a like, a date that has like, every like, oh, it's doubles. So it's like, it's like, march 6 2000 936 Shine? Sure. Very suspicious date. magical powers on this date.

Jordan  58:00
I like that. One thing that's never really addressed is how many holidays a cult people have to have. It is every day there is a holiday,

Dan  58:11
there is something they should take away the bombing. And we should all live like that. Every day is special and worth celebrating.

Jordan  58:18
Every but not every day. Mars is the closest it's going to be in 60,000

Dan  58:22
years. No, that's true. It's gonna be 59,009. And something years before we get that again someday, and look at it because there will be 1000 years. So

Jordan  58:36
know that Yeah, put it on your calendars. So Alex,

Dan  58:39
we know that his dad was a big JBS guy, and bad influence on him. Turns out his uncle wasn't better. My uncle

Alex Jones  58:47
really is an expert on the New World Order. He started it for years. I had an argument with him about five years ago, I said yeah, the New World Order is gonna set up a beast system and biometrics but I said it's gonna take time to do that. He said, No, they build it. They lined it all up. They get it ready, and they announce it. And boy, how true his knowledge on that is. That's what they do. They just, they set the whole thing up we go gee, what's mine these curtains? They lift the curtains and it's a total dehumanizing Satan pit. Oh, interesting. Ladies and gentlemen.

Jordan  59:25
I like that image

Dan  59:26
like a goblin. Demon feast

Jordan  59:29
is a dehumanizing Satan pit

Dan  59:33
and his response to that is interesting. Yeah.

Jordan  59:36
Well, that is interesting. I would like to know what that is. Ladies

Dan  59:40
and gentlemen, I regret to inform you we are in Satan.

Jordan  59:44
Okay, so you trip and you fall into the dehumanizing Satan pit? Yeah, what is dehumanizing specifically inside the pit

Dan  59:55
i don't know i I'm trying to visualize this right

Jordan  59:59
I appreciate First off, my favorite visual is lifting up the curtain to reveal Tada. That's that's just great. That's good showmanship. Okay, if you reveal if you open a curtain to a pit, it's good stuff. Yeah. All right. Oh, it's in the pit.

Dan  1:00:15
It could be anything, man.

Jordan  1:00:16
I mean, it would have to be it. There's got to be more than one Satan in the pit. First of all, there need to be multiple Satan's in this pit.

Dan  1:00:25
Is that possible?

Jordan  1:00:27
I mean, I assume he can split himself up. He's got classic Marvel powers these days. All

Dan  1:00:31
right, right, right. Sure. Yes, not my say.

Jordan  1:00:39
This is like the argument that Alex and his uncle had. Probably.

Dan  1:00:43
I think that's cousin Buckley's dad. Oh, yeah. That's my guess. Because he's definitely someone who Alex is brought up before right. I read talks about uncle's with information. So fun. Oh, yeah. There's another news story that Alex touches on here.

Alex Jones  1:00:58
Bush picks news Selective Service Director, Crawford, Texas President Bush has picked a former lobbyist and ex marine as director of the Selective Service. Bush said Tuesday intends to nominate William A Chatfield for the post. The Selective Service will provide manpower for the military of an emergency force to draft Oh, and they've got all the bills lined up. Now one more terror attack universal draft. It collects young men's names through the Selective Service registration system to try to change the law for women. Chat. Phil is currently a government relations consultant with kindness and Chatfield associates in Washington. So that's real, real, real nice.

Dan  1:01:48
And all the things where people talk about how accurate Alex is. They seem to just forget his constant obsession with how a universal draft was right around the corner and how the globalist had it set up. So the next time there was a terrorist attack? That was it, and all your sons and daughters were going to be conscripted? Yeah. Big Wave on that. And he was very Evans brings it up all the time. Yeah. One wonders if Alex made a big stink when Trump nominated Donald Benton to this position in April 2017. If that was evidence of Trump trying to reinstate the draft, I would imagine it wasn't I don't think he probably even noticed. Yeah, this is a small government office that has existed since World War One, and could probably just be abolished. Even though it's not a pool for a draft, the names and information gathered from Selective Service registration are used by the Joint advertising marketing research and studies program out of the Department of Defense, which uses that information to recruit volunteers into the armed service.

Jordan  1:02:44
Anyone anything not evil? It's not.

Dan  1:02:47
It's not cool. Right? Right. But there isn't a draft and there wasn't one in 2003. Now, that being said, let's do x this office.

Jordan  1:02:54
There's Yeah, get rid of that. That's that's bad. I mean, there's it's obvious there won't be a drugged out, we can barely afford the military we have now can you imagine if we just had an influx of, I don't know, 10 million people just to walk in there? How much would it cost to outfit them? We've got to spend a trillion dollars on one plane,

Dan  1:03:14
I kind of understand the thinking of something like this in past days, although I think that there is a social contract that has come into place. That is we will never have a draft again, ever. No, that is not something that is going to be seen as appropriate on any level. And because of that, I think it would be a show of good faith for the government. Just get rid of this office. Yeah. Because there's this premise of it. That is like in case we need, right, this registration break glass. Yeah, right. Yeah. Go ahead and get rid of that, because you're not going to need it because we're not doing the draft again. Yeah.

Jordan  1:03:53
Well, I mean, you know, it is it is always a pretty a universal step towards fascism. Whenever you have a standing army at the call, you know, like part of that that idea of a medical army? Well, no, I mean, the current standing army, though, we have, you know, the part of that hypothetical draft is you're not really supposed to have an army. That's, you know, so everybody has their own skin in the game, so to speak. And now it is kind of an imperative. You know, that's kind of part of our agreement. You know, we don't have a draft and then we'll look the other way. Whenever you start wars all the time.

Dan  1:04:31
We can go ahead and get rid of that part of it, too.

Jordan  1:04:33
Yeah, that would be nice. Get rid of most of these offices.

Dan  1:04:37
So look, Alex in the present day talking a lot about being broke, and being in debt. And, you know, he needs money. Yeah. I found the first time he ever said this, okay, on the very

Jordan  1:04:52
first time. Well, I

Dan  1:04:53
mean, if you believe what he's about,

Jordan  1:04:54
oh, so he says,

Alex Jones  1:04:55
the first time Gotcha. And I have to do this. I've never done this in five Your settlers and they're not want you. I am with a shortwave bill. And Jim Shepard has been helping me so, so it's paid to the shortwave outlet. I'm about $15,000 behind and, and folks, we need you to simply buy the videos, I let you make copies of them, and buy the books and, and, and buy the products from sponsors like Jim Shepard, because because when we when, you know when I have a sponsor that covers part of the cost, and I covered the other part of the expanse, very important that that sponsor be supported, especially when they got a real product. That's amazing. I don't mean to make this a long rant. I'm not gonna start doing this all the time. But I want to keep reaching the people in that French. In that French village. I want to keep reaching the people in hiding and Indonesia. I want to continue to reach people in Japan and and in the Highlands of Scotland. Jim Shepard, good to have you on the show. 

Jim Shepard  1:06:01
Always a pleasure to be with you, Alex. 

Alex Jones  1:06:03
And I'm sorry to sit there while I went through that diatribe. 

Jim Shepard  1:06:05
But Alex, I really respect the way you do things. Know this, but you know,

Jim Shepard  1:06:12
several times I've mentioned to you, you know, Alex maybe to give next response or on there. And invariably what you tell me is Jim, I'm not going to turn my show into an infomercial into a merchandising infomercial document do and I want to get news out and that's my primary objective

Dan  1:06:28
to wow, yeah, that's kind of a bummer

Jordan  1:06:31
that to hear someone else say back to him in the past. Woof. Woof fair

Dan  1:06:37
news, Jim. Yeah. Yeah. Jim. Show did largely a marketing infomercial II Ike's? Yeah. So he's the water filter sponsor. Right. So basically, it's just the introduction of an infomercial. With this. A I'm behind on my shortwave bill. Right, right. Cuz we pay for air time on the shortwave station. Sure. And my water filter guy helps pay that bill. So here he is, by his water filter, it

Jordan  1:07:09
does seem very difficult to square someone saying, You know what, I like that you don't do infomercials, and you've got the integrity to not turn your show into. Anyways, my water filters are the best

Dan  1:07:23
I do. I agree with you. It does bear mentioning that it is not as intrusive at this. No, no, of course, it's not the whole show, right? It's at least like Alright, here's a chunk that they're doing. And it's pretty transparent that this is this guy selling his shit right now at the same time. A lot of Jim's sales pitch for his water filter is about the evils of fluoride. Sure. And so like there is still like content that's being used as marketing, right. So there's still that like blurry distinction, but on Kanye, but man, it's it is a far cry from the deterioration into infomercial city. And leaving behind the information. Yeah, that Alex becomes later

Jordan  1:08:05
it is it is like I appreciate most of all that $15,000 number, you know, that I see like

Dan  1:08:13
Tito's when you look at Alex, you

Jordan  1:08:15
know, but I feel like that's where you got to stay at the $50,000 is important to you. Because then look at rim. Now he's got shell companies, he's got to have accountants willing to lie for him. And then he's got to have accountants that his accountants lied to, in order to launder their lies, right. Like that is a web of bullshit. Think about this. He's just got a bill.

Dan  1:08:36
He's in such dicey legal situations that he has to be friends with Barnes.

Jordan  1:08:40
Yeah. All you've got to do is pay your shortwave bill. You stay there. Yeah, stay there. It's a good sweet spot. Yeah, absolutely.

Dan  1:08:49
Poor Alex. Yeah. There's a lot of folks who, you know, defend Alex. Yep. And one of the things that they say I think you would agree with and that is that he tells it like it is.

Alex Jones  1:09:03
I tell it like it is. I don't pull my punches. I fight evil I expose the New World Order. Evidence is now coming out the bombing in Jakarta, Indonesia, was the work of the globalist they were pulling their people out hours before it took place from the very hotel itself, not other hotels. They had threatened the government to submit to total globalist control or terrorists would strike telling it like

Dan  1:09:27
it is. Telling It Like It

Jordan  1:09:32
Is no one who says no one who says I tell it like it is ever actually one does or two has anything good to

Dan  1:09:41
say what about people who call them like they see them?

Jordan  1:09:44
Well that that's delicious as long as you add the literal Yeah, it calls them like a season. That's That's good stuff. Okay, so that one's All right. That's a little bit that has a

Dan  1:09:54
an irreverent tone, but a straight shooter,

Jordan  1:09:56
straight shooter. No, no, no. It's something that other people describe you as that makes me think that you are a liar. Yeah.

Dan  1:10:04
So Alex takes more calls here. And he gets a call from a guy who I think doesn't believe in laws.

Jordan  1:10:11
I appreciate this man.

Dan  1:10:12
It's kind of difficult to tell exactly where he's coming from. But he believes, I think maybe in a God's law kind of situation,

Jordan  1:10:22
I got that self evident law, yet natural law,

Dan  1:10:26
perhaps not specific enough for me to really nail down but he does believe that just because laws are signed into law, that doesn't mean they're laws. So he's not in the jurisdiction. He's more

Jordan  1:10:38
the law of the jungle kind of guy.

Dan  1:10:42
Based on his voice, I don't think he lost in the jungle.

Jordan  1:10:45
Yeah, well, that's probably true,

Dan  1:10:46
but maybe spiritual. Okay. Anyway, he has a request, Alex.

Alex Jones  1:10:51
Fred, I keep running all over you. But I've had you on a couple of segments. Anything else you wanted to add from New Mexico?

Caller Fred (720)  1:10:57
Just want to know if I can get a time to call you out for a few minutes or half a year? I got some thanks to hash. Oh, we're just gonna take some thought.

Alex Jones  1:11:06
Unfortunately, from the time I leave here until about midnight tonight, I'm going to be working good excuse. I don't know when I can talk to you sir. I mean, I'm not trying to say I'm a big shot or anything. I'm I'm in deep trouble. I have hundreds of phone calls, hundreds of emails, faxes with folks want to talk to me. And I mean, let's talk about it here on the air. Go ahead. What's going

Dan  1:11:32
on behind the eight ball?

Jordan  1:11:34
I like I like it when trying to let him down easy gets away out of hey, I'm

Dan  1:11:38
in big trouble.

Jordan  1:11:40
To the point where he's like, Listen, I'm on the run from the cops right now. I can't be taking phone calls. At any point in time.

Dan  1:11:47
I can't even be doing radio show. Honestly.

Jordan  1:11:50
Listen, I had to get rid of my phone. I've got burner phones, I throw them into the ocean after I use them one time,

Dan  1:11:56
I'm in a bunker that is sealed with lead. And they'll never find

Jordan  1:12:01
me. I'm buying the eight ball. I'm working for the next six hours. I'm being chased by the cops. I've got to take my daughter fishing at some point. Yeah. So I can't call you it seems

Dan  1:12:13
really obvious. The way you could just handle this. Yeah. And that is that like it is unsafe for me to talk to you off the air? Yeah, I don't know what you're up to. There's a lot of ways that this could expose me. It's just, if you're Alex, this is the simplest thing in the world. But you don't want to give that message. Because it's too likely to make the audience think that you think that they're crazy. Yeah. Whereas Alex is a big public figure there is there is a very acceptable boundary to be like, I'm not talking to you on my like, off air, we don't know each other. You can send an email or something. But it's not we're not going to do that.

Jordan  1:12:56
When you when you court when you actively court people who blur the line between reality and fiction, it's going to be a little bit more of a tighter walk to let him down easy, on account of you don't know what part of the fiction that's going to add you into? That's true, you know? Yeah.

Dan  1:13:12
And, you know, you see that through a lot of interactions that Alex has with his fans over the course of time. Yeah, is there is an unwillingness to be honest about what the boundary is because of that. I know

Jordan  1:13:24
who you are. Right? You know, I know. And we just need to keep this separate. You know,

Dan  1:13:30
the only thing I know about you is you believe what I say, you

Jordan  1:13:33
know, you like me, and that's bad. Yeah,

Dan  1:13:37
it's you know, that Groucho Marx thing, I don't want to be a member of any club that would have a member Sure. Surely, that's used to describe low self esteem, right? But with Alex,

Jordan  1:13:46
who completely different I made this club and I don't ever want to visit this club, I keep it closed, I lock the door with them. I don't say I

Dan  1:13:54
don't want to be around anybody who would be a member of my club. Listen,

Jordan  1:13:59
I own the double deuce. And I'm not stepping foot in that fucking place.

Dan  1:14:03
So. So anyway, this caller, here's what he wants to discuss with Alex off it here.

Alex Jones  1:14:09
Let's talk about it here on the air. Go ahead, what's going on?

Unknown Speaker  1:14:12
Well, to conserve the interpretation of the Bible, nobly, and we are not supposed to fear and he says to expose the devil and he will flee from you, oh, boy. And it's a long story. Hopefully, pieces of this puzzle are scattered from one end of the Bible to the other. Together, right order. They're gonna take some serious thought, because the price shed that describes will revert the Scripture. And there are some places it takes real research to figure out what was changed. This is not a total Holy Word of God. It is the perverted Word of God. And I think it would take half an hour I mean, and

Jordan  1:15:02
probably probably longer than that, sir. Sir. You have just explained why I do not want to talk to

Dan  1:15:07
you off air. People have been Bible for quite a while now you didn't you have cracking get there you crack the code, you're telling me and it'll take you half an hour to explain.

Jordan  1:15:23
Yeah, it's I'm sure you're gonna stop at a half hour, I'm gonna start the watch and that you, you don't get on with things. Yeah.

Dan  1:15:31
So you have one last clip here. And I know that another thing that was making the rounds on social media was recently was a clip of Alex saying that there was gonna be false flag globalist terror attacks. You know, before the midterms, this is another clip that will run flip kowski decided to post without context, relevant context that Alex says that all the fucking time pretty much every day. Yeah, it is not worthwhile or meaningful to post at all to make people think this is like, Oh, look at him. Look at him. He's making a desperate weird prediction. No, this is what he does every day. Yeah. And has since 2003.

Alex Jones  1:16:10
I've already read Patriot Act Two and allows them to secretly grab you blow your head off for any misdemeanor charge and

Unknown Speaker  1:16:16
get business records without a court order. And Ashcroft is going to go on a 10 state tour to promote this. Well,

Alex Jones  1:16:24
I know he's already promoting it. I'm sorry. 20 State I think we state to her but but but you're telling me that

Jordan  1:16:31
he's recording especially

Unknown Speaker  1:16:33
today's New York Daily News, if you want you could get the

Alex Jones  1:16:36
Daily News online. Well, the fact that they're introducing this now tells me you're getting ready to do some boom, boom. Oh, you're gonna do some

Dan  1:16:41
boom, booming.

Jordan  1:16:44
I mean, let's see. We've had explosions before the midterm. We've had nukes before a presidential election. Sure. We've had they were gonna ramp up school shootings but

Dan  1:16:55
helicopter into Trump's inauguration.

Jordan  1:16:57
Yep. Yeah. I mean, they were there. Obviously, the polonium poisoning was rampant for a while. There

Dan  1:17:03
were two incidents now to the same person. That also didn't happen. Right. Right. Right. Yes, there was that? Yeah, I mean, it's just it's constant. It's a Hallmark and feature of his career. And anybody who doesn't understand that. It's window dressing. Yeah. It's again, just like we were laughing and joking about this before it just like, if you ask Alex, is there a reason to be scared about something? Absolutely. Yeah. And one of the things he always uses to scare people is that specter of the coming false flag attack? Yeah, that is justified by some piece of his his narrative. There is obviously Democrats are scared that they're going to lose the midterms. And so they must do bombings in order to make sure they win the midterms. Right. Ashcroft wants to get Patriot Act to in but there's opposition to it from the Patriots. He's better do some boom booming in order to make sure that this goes through. It's always, it's always this, and I don't understand how it's been 20 years. I know it's years, and it's still an effective thing. It's still something that people can

Jordan  1:18:16
it's because people dip in and out. It's because people like Ron Phillips ski get to dip in and out a fucking youth baseball coach. turned by the media into some fucking alt right hero for just being a fucking idiot. I hate him so much. But yeah, I mean, it is it is that like, Oh, if you dip in every three or four months, then you have in your head this idea? Well, he can't do this every day, right? Because you assume that because there's no way he could do this every day.

Dan  1:18:48
I mean, even if you have an awareness of who Alex is, and you don't pay much attention, like Jon Ronson even was like, does he repeat things? Absolutely. Yeah, there is there is a awareness of what Alex does that you only really get by watching a bunch of it. And unfortunately, I don't think that most people should do that. Because it's obviously

Jordan  1:19:06
well, I mean, the problem is our own assumptions based on how everything else works. It is to us unsustainable to do the same thing every day,

Dan  1:19:17
where you imagine how bored you would get if a show that you watch.

Jordan  1:19:21
You see a clip every few months, and you go, Wow, this must be an unusual thing. It wouldn't be newsworthy. Yeah, he's on one. It wouldn't be newsworthy events every day. But it's newsworthy because it's manufactured for you. It's created for you.

Dan  1:19:37
I think there's that the dipping in and out for sure. Yeah. Is is a piece of it. And I also think that one of the reasons that it stays effective is you know, there is just pain in the world, like negative traumatic events do happen. Sure. And those are things that Alex will then attach these ideas to right and that people I guess people will just excel uriens that as being the confirmation and they'll forget about all the countless times that he's been making up vague warnings about boom, boom.

Jordan  1:20:10
And yeah, I mean, the thing that's most suspicious is like in 20 years the globalists would have to have taken a break for a bit at least they have never stopped not once there's no a despite the fact that they celebrate a million holidays every year. It is always a work holiday. They never even take a vacation. Well,

Dan  1:20:30
they're like Alex that way. Yeah. Even the he's not working ever. No, but that just gave me an idea for a movie.

Jordan  1:20:40
globalist vacation they finally take a Lampoon's Vacation.

Dan  1:20:45
Now we have two movie pictures. Okay, that's why that's the second one. The globalists are on vacation. Sure, but there's still need to be false flags naturally. So they bring in the junior varsity globalist temps Right, right. Right,

Jordan  1:20:59
right. Absolutely. Somebody gets somebody gets promoted. This is their big shot, right? But it turns out this that eager young person, this is

Dan  1:21:07
a this is a if they were younger, or we would made this movie like 15 years ago, this would be a Vince Vaughn Oh, and Wilson Absolutely. They're the guys who come in and they

Jordan  1:21:16
ragtag band of misfits, they they screw everything up. But at the end, they come together and really the cast of

Dan  1:21:23
old school as the

Jordan  1:21:28
club was vacation, no the globalist

Dan  1:21:31
turn. Yeah,

Jordan  1:21:33
what would we call them? I mean, you got to call them something like the nation squad. You know, they're not global now. That sucks. Sure. We'll work on Yeah, we'll workshop this and have it back for you in about six months, we'll get a treatment going. Yep. Yep. So I'm

Dan  1:21:51
glad to have gone back to the past because at least there is something concrete going on to be discussed. It's been that that is

Jordan  1:22:01
refreshing. I appreciate the past a great deal.

Dan  1:22:04
And so we'll check back in on the present day, keep people posted on dumb bullshit Alex is up to is the the terror of the midterms,

Jordan  1:22:15
the midterms, but until then, Jordan, we have a website. We do have a website. It's outright.com. We're also on Twitter. We are on Twitter. It's at knowledge underscore fight. We will be back

Dan  1:22:25
but until then, I'm Neo. I'm Leo M D ZX clerk. I'm Gerald Snuggles. No, Wilford

Jordan  1:22:30
Sybil Sabol of the dribbles. J Yeah, I was wondering where Gerald?

Dan  1:22:35
Wilford cousin Ah, yeah, Wilford Sybil Snapple of the Gribble. Pebble, and now here

Alex Jones  1:22:42
comes the sex robots. Andy in Kansas, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:47
Well, Alex, I'm a first time caller. I'm a huge fan. I love your work.
