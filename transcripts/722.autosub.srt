The 20,000

14
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,696
Feeding if I do it

15
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:12,864
I mean I've already given a lot to the sibelius that I may be as I've given a lot

16
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,984
Already but it's like I don't know if I could be the one who get this over-the-top better feels wrong

17
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,784

20
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,280
Thank you all for joining in

21
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:47,680
Inspirational the finally did some laundry

22
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:54,336
You know it laundry has that you know that roller coaster laundry whenever Avila

23
00:02:54,592 --> 00:03:00,736
More and more fill do you're more likely to do it until you get to a certain point where it becomes less and less likely comes intimidate

24
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:07,136
Yeah yeah piling up and everytime you look at it you're like I've got to do that but you continued

25
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:13,536
I know that feeling I reached the point of no return on that and then finally

26
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:16,608
Did my laundry you know it was one of those like

27
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,912
My last pair of underwear

28
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:25,312
Was not underwear so much as holes that had little bindings near it I get to that point that you're

29
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:29,408
Describing there at the end quite a bit as somebody who is

30
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:35,808
But somewhat of a shot in reach the end of the laundry

31
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:42,208
Cuz I'm more acquainted with the end of the laundry I am much quicker to throw away those things in it

32
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:48,608
Buy me more frequently

33
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:55,008
The back of the drawer on the other hand you know having that

34
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,568
Final warning pair of underwear

35
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:03,968
That's the that's the last sign before Cliff said you know that red alert

36
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:08,832
Is almost comforting autunno shreds that I call underwear

37
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:15,232
Saran all over it's all over hell yeah

38
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:18,303

You are now a technocrat

51
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,791
I'm a policy wonk

52
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,559
I have

53
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,095
Risen above

54
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,119
Miami

55
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,775
A little breaking for me

56
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:35,359
And then we're going to come back

57
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,431
And I'm going to start the show over

58
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,551
Q

59
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,831
F*** you

60
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:47,391
I got plenty work for you but at the end of the day

61
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,439
F*** you and your new world order

62
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,487
And f****** horse you rode in on

63
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,023
And all your s***

64
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,071
Maybe Nashville almost broadcast

65
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,631
Maybe I'll just be gone a month baby 5 years

66
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,447
Maybe I'll walk out of here tomorrow

67
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,983
And you never see me again

68
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,287
That's really what I want to do

69
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,591
I never want to come back here again

70
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:10,175
I apologize to the crew in the listener's yesterday that I

71
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:13,503
Was legitimately having breakdowns on air

72
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,039
I'll be better tomorrow

73
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,063
He might be

74
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:22,463
He's not unsure but we don't know.

75
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,487
Show

76
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:24,767
I have another

77
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,303
There were nine

78
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,607
Human AI

79
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,375
But he

80
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,911
He is a an agent

81
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:35,519
And so he has maybe a vested interest in misleading me

82
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,055
Yeah I would be a little

83
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:44,479
Yeah I respect that about that we got

84
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:49,855
We have someone who is off

85
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:56,255
I do love that I do love the way that you can just drop that so casually if your carriages like

86
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:02,655
And he's an agent if the queen has no that's not an absurd thing to say also

87
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:09,055
If you didn't recognize the voice at the end of Solomon

88
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:15,455
End of the squad he made a return appearance.

89
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:21,855
Much like you know when Alex sees Biden giving a speech in front of a red things

90
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,903
Doing emergency report and for us

91
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:30,303
If there's squash.

92
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:36,703
Now unfortunately I do want it I want to say something before we get into this

93
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:49,503
Yeah it was fairly certain if not before

94
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:55,903
But it's like now we're at a different situation I had a little bit of trepidation even about covering

95
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,975
Because it's so clear

96
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:03,071
Reasons why my maybe don't want to blow up his spot

97
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:06,143
I don't know this person so it's not like

98
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:12,543
I ate we. We're not running

99
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:16,127
King with Carrie

100
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:19,199
Kind of gets me around on I still think

101
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:23,807
I want to cover this is that I don't think this is a prank

102
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,879
Like this isn't mean-spirited

103
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:32,255
It's not making fun of Carrie for believing that this guy telepathically but

104
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:36,607
That is true there seems to be a project

105
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,399
That he's working on

106
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,447
And maybe I'm being a little bit

107
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:46,847
Reading more into this thing the needs of energy

108
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:47,615
Rejecting

109
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,383
Like

110
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,407
Non

111
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:55,807
Neo-Nazi okay Medicaid space spaces

112
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,855
Taking me up on the offer to

113
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:04,255
Lie their way into people being good I'm not sure I'm not sure

114
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:09,887
I think it's interesting I have no

115
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:16,031
Like involvement or anything with her outside of him just very clearly being a listener of our show

116
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:23,455
And yeah I think as long as it's not mean-spirited we're already in too deep

117
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:29,855
We might as well we have buttons about the squad

118
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,647
Is who we are now we have

119
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:35,999
Inextricably tied ourselves through the Squatch

120
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:42,399
So yeah it's a this is a longer interview and not much about Squatch on this one

121
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:48,543
You guys is mostly about Mars alright history of Mars

122
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:54,943
You know what that is a good point Mission to Mars and all of the

123
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,783
The goings-on

124
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:05,183
Mwc what we feel as we go along here is the first clip just cuz I know you like to say hi

125
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:10,303
Hi everyone I'm sure Cal Project Camelot and very happy to be here

126
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,071
Today

127
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,631
So I have major Solomon Berg

128
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,911
With me and

129
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,959
This is going to be the second

130
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,727
Interview

131
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,007
That I did with him

132
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,079
And basically we are

133
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,103
Alive

134
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,127
Interview here

135
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,455
And then I take it offline and I I do

136
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:29,247
Edit any glitches that

137
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,783
First one and then

138
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:31,807
We put it out

139
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,623
So they're gonna live

140
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,391
That's fun

141
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:41,791
So she's doing live and then she's editing it and then putting it out not life

142
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,071
They're just like any other show

143
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:49,471
It was broadcast live wherever

144
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:52,799
Exciting

145
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:57,663
Element of the day

146
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,943
There's no chaos

147
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:04,319
But should I kind of considered when we were listening to the first

148
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,111
One was that

149
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:09,183
I feel like Carrie Mae

150
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,207
Like not

151
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,255
Believe this

152
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:16,095
Or make cuz it seemed like it might be too much to incorporate

153
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:19,167
There were ideas that were far more

154
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,471
To the left of

155
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:26,079
Her political ideology

156
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:29,151
She be like I don't believe this but turns out

157
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:35,039
Is the real deal again

158
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,319
Thrilled to death

159
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,599
Machu Picchu really

160
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,647
Do this kind of an interview

161
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,927
Because

162
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,463
As far as I'm concerned

163
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,511
You know you're the real thing and

164
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,303
I know we have some

165
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,607
Other people out there that have

166
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,167
Maybe skepticism

167
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:54,495
So maybe we can kind of go down that road a little bit

168
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,055
You know

169
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,847
Get rid of a few of their

170
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,895
Your fears and skepticism in

171
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,919
And see if we can

172
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,991
Bring them round but at any rate

173
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,783
Major bird

174
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,807
Is

175
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,599
If this week all these

176
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,415
The series of the Ambassador and that refers

177
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,183
To the

178
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,463
What a great name

179
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,487
That he

180
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:16,511
Or Yeti

181
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,303
You know there's other names

182
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,327
Of course

183
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,375
That is a

184
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,167
Innocence and extra

185
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,703
Terrestrial race

186
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,239
A beings that are

187
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,775
Here on Earth with us

188
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,079
And and he connects

189
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:30,847
Explain that

190
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,615
So

191
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,663
I think that Carrie is in

192
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:40,063
Jackie definitely you saying he's the real deal and I think that if you look at the comment

193
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:44,671
There are some people who are expressing like I don't know about that

194
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:49,023
And I think it's because there is a mentality around all this stuff

195
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,303
That exists

196
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,655
In Project Camelot in a lot of these paranormal or or

197
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,959
You know space conspiracy worlds

198
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,495
That has to do with

199
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,031
That defining

200
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:06,431
Alien by their race and stuff like that are absolutely love your personality

201
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:14,879
And bucking that is probably something that the audience doesn't really ready for maybe have a tuft

202
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:21,279
What I'm hearing and thinking is real I mean it is it is kind of that laying bear a certain

203
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:24,095
An element of racism which is a shortcut

204
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:30,495
It is a malicious as it is at the same time whenever you move it into this like

205
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:36,383
Oh oh elves and dwarves all have elfish and dwarfish characteristics that kind of thing

206
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,223
Then you realize that a lot of these people it's not malicious it's just like

207
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,527
I can't meet everybody

208
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:46,367
So guess what I'm deciding all elves are the same today

209
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:50,463
That's what it is you know cuz I just I have 9 friends

210
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:56,863
I know them by name and that everybody else is the same that's an awful benign version of racism

211
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:01,727
The one with else is that version you know what I'm saying

212
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:07,359
That that type of situation on hatred

213
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:13,759
That is kind of just providing this the sort of mindset that does category

214
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:20,159
Rise the kind of person that probably would be much easier to grasp but then someone who

215
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:23,743
Their opinions are backed by hates

216
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:29,119
So maybe maybe there is some potential there but I don't know if

217
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,911
Could take a bit to get it

218
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:37,311
The audience to accept this

219
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:41,407
More left of Carrey's political ideology

220
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:47,807
I don't know if she has like an ideology that is rigid so much as some

221
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,831
Something that is like

222
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:52,415
Influence by whatever whoever is talking to her and

223
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,951
I mean

224
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,255
About Chichi very much

225
00:14:56,511 --> 00:15:01,631
You know through her conversations about the things that she believes true is almost

226
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:04,447
Always on the reactionary right

227
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,031
I find it difficult to

228
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:14,431
Categorize her any other way more like in terms of

229
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,991
Seemingly more about

230
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,527
Civil rights

231
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:24,415
Maybe maybe things that the folks on the last

232
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:29,791
The armoire generally equals at least

233
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:34,911
So the last we spoke John Solomon Berg was in a bunker in Israel

234
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,471
Because Squatch had to get out of the u.s.

235
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:43,615
Now they have come back to the Pacific Northwest

236
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:48,223
Major bird can you explain maybe your new circumstances

237
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,247
And also

238
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,295
Speak to the idea that

239
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,343
Some people question whether the

240
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,391
Actually your legitimate

241
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,951
Yeah yes

242
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,743
So I am

243
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,559
Apart from some individuals also

244
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,863
Express concerns

245
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,631
And

246
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,935
I wanted to address that

247
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,215
And I want you to

248
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:13,311
Explain that I am actually transmitting from a different load

249
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,871
Then

250
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,759
So I'm coming to you actually

251
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:23,807
From the north

252
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:24,831
Us

253
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,647
I've come back home I think

254
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,183
Permitted to come home with

255
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:30,719
Whitney Bass

256
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,863
He's been given

257
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,143
Sutherlands

258
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:42,239
2 Acres

259
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,031
Safe

260
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,591
Wow he awake

261
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,127
Transport off

262
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,711
He was able to

263
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,479
Reach

264
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,319
Operated by his own people

265
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,367
By the overmind

266
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,647
And that ship

267
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,927
Is traveling through

268
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,719
Space-warp quarter

269
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:06,303
It will be here within a batter weeks

270
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:07,839
And

271
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:10,399
The Ambassador will be leaving

272
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:20,383
Do love him being called the Ambassador could not love that more

273
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,407
If he needed to

274
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:27,807
He could and if there if there was a Revenge plot the Ambassador also does Revenge you know like if somebody kills the Ambassador

275
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:34,207
That's when you find out he's played by Liam Neeson this watch and then it's it's a perfect name yeah it's

276
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:36,511
It's something that fits in a lot of great places

277
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:42,911
DJ the Polish ambassador

278
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:49,311
Annotations of like this is a personal really hole exactly what you do

279
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:55,711
People feel good for a while and then there's a war I think

280
00:17:55,967 --> 00:18:02,111
Famous Brand ambassadors intitle France

281
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,135
That's so fun

282
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:07,999
Scratches leaving that's

283
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,047
Certainly quite a development

284
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:17,215
I think he said he's in the Northeast I could have swore you said he was in the Pacific Northwest

285
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:23,615
Watches in the Pacific Northwest and he's in the Northeast maybe he was permitted to return home address

286
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:30,015
How many pets squash is being monitored by drunk right of me to be this and in the in the Northeast you're not going to find the suit

287
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:33,599
Suitable

288
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:40,255
Florida or the Pacific Northwest

289
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:45,887
Turn around in the Hamptons far

290
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,911
No

291
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,959
Yeah they're back

292
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,775
Better than ever

293
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:55,871
I like a few weeks I like a few weeks is it time.

294
00:18:56,127 --> 00:19:02,271
That's great he explains so much faster but

295
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:06,879
Away stuff you absolutely that is so f****** him at is it

296
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:13,279
That is exactly what makes us talking about how like these the sort of space probe

297
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:19,679
Programs conservative politically but like

298
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:32,479
This is absent from so many of these these stories

299
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:38,879
Like oh where a type 2 civilization but we still got to pinch pennies you know what I'm saying

300
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:45,279
You don't get to be a type 2 Civilization by sending all the time he's either you're certainly are getting built

301
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:51,679
You're right so the Skeptics

302
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,983
Have some questions and Berg has some answers

303
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,775
And I also would like you

304
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:56,799
Briefly

305
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,079
Explain

306
00:19:59,103 --> 00:19:59,615
You have some

307
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:00,639
Optics out there

308
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:01,663
Explain

309
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,199
You know your rank

310
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,735
The military

311
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:05,759
Relationship

312
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,039
To the military

313
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:07,807
And how that

314
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:11,135
Yes I'm a military scientist

315
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,671
I think there were some Keith

316
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,439
People who

317
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,231
Edward

318
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:20,351
Presentation on my application that I didn't

319
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,631
IC markets

320
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:23,935
Because I'm not

321
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,263
Was attacks Marine

322
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,055
Murray

323
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,079
Renege

324
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,383
And was

325
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,431
Given the rain

326
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:36,735
Major

327
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,527
I'm through a series of

328
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,295
Motion

329
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,063
But no

330
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,087
I'm

331
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,367
That I've been

332
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,159
Part of the Marine Corps has

333
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,719
I have been engaged

334
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:47,743
Primarily

335
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,559
And when I have been

336
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,631
On sabbatical from the millage

337
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,399
Already

338
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,423
I have been engaged

339
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,471
I am

340
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,263
Make sense

341
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:00,799
I have been

342
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,335
Physical

343
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,359
And culture

344
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,895
Apology little bit of

345
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,223
My main focus

346
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,015
My primary focus

347
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,063
Coach Ron Fisher

348
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,135
Archaeology

349
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,672
Experience also

350
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:21,536
And I really am just someone who

351
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,816
Figures out

352
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,096
Other cultures

353
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:24,864
Weather.

354
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:28,192
To Americans

355
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,056
My

356
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:33,824
Expertise

357
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:34,848
People

358
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:35,872
Weather

359
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,408
Humans

360
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:45,856
So my

361
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,696
My sort of focus has always been

362
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:51,488
The social dynamics

363
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,560
A different life

364
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:58,144
And sort of the intercept

365
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:08,640
There's a Humanity to the topics that he's talking about

366
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,688
He's talking about cultures of

367
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,736
Complex

368
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,040
Groupings of aliens in

369
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:22,464
It's so much more interesting we're not s*** talking while he's talking I'm interested

370
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:28,864
Like I realized that it's it's fake but it's so interesting in reach world

371
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:35,264
Discuss traditional like Raptors are fighting

372
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,080
Write the Beatles write or whatever and like

373
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:44,480
I don't know I don't understand why they wouldn't be infinitely more compelling

374
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:49,088
Apologist as a Sci-Fi protagonist in so great

375
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:55,488
It reminded me of out of the Silent Planet with c.s. Lewis whatever had a linguist be the protagonist leaving to play

376
00:22:57,024 --> 00:23:03,168
That gives you so many options of communication as being the point instead of like

377
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,752
We can't talk so let's kill him you don't like that kind of thing

378
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:12,128
There aren't those confetti for all of lovecraft's

379
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:18,528
Failings which are many that is really great about the way the story's work is protagonist is almost

380
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,296
Always

381
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:25,696
A frail weirdo it was like interested in history

382
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:32,096
It's the fat that it does lend itself also to that that perspective being things are viewed

383
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:35,424
Logical view of

384
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,216
Alien cultures

385
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:37,984
Is like

386
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:44,896
There's so much to have to do it seems like the only rational way to view them honestly

387
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:51,296
Who carries world are all weapons

388
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:57,696
Space Second Amendment people more like space dad's suddenly stop can't stop reading about world

389
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:59,488
42 I think that's what it like

390
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:05,888
Oh there's another documentary about Hitler or the Swatch I'm watching either one

391
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:13,056
So Terry brings up he has Israel and come back to the United States

392
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:15,872
Dropped a Bomb on carry-on

393
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:16,896
Last time we

394
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:18,432
Spoke you were in Israel

395
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,736
Are you had originally been in the US

396
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,272
Under military

397
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,112
Housing and all of that song

398
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,136
Everything in the US

399
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,160
And then you

400
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:30,208
Had a reason because of

401
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,512
If I understand it correctly

402
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,280
Play Andra call

403
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,096
The treatment of squash

404
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:38,912
Getting questionable in the US York

405
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,192
Concerned for his safety

406
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,984
You made a deal with you

407
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:42,752
Israeli

408
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:45,312
And because you have a Jewish background

409
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,640
I'm not I don't know if that's the only reason but they

410
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:50,432
They allowed you into their country

411
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:53,504
You you lived primarily Underground

412
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,296
Whisk watch

413
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,600
So now you're back

414
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,648
And you're above ground

415
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:01,696
So can you cover that ground

416
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:03,488
We're all caught up

417
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:05,792
Talked about in your own words and

418
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:06,816
Explain

419
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,096
How did those

420
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:08,864
Different

421
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,632
.

422
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,424
First with the military

423
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,448
Second

424
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:14,240
You know in America then with

425
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:16,032
Israeli military and now you're

426
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,568
In the u.s. how does that

427
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,616
So going back

428
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,384
2

429
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,920
Original

430
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:22,688
Issue

431
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:24,992
Yeah

432
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,784
What is Noggin

433
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,064
Mystikal danger here

434
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,112
But swap was the dangerous

435
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,000
So

436
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:37,024
Watch you

437
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:37,792
Now

438
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,584
He were calling him being.

439
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,424
Shell gas

440
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,960
Before they have a title

441
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,264
They

442
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,056
Use titles like the Arctic

443
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,080
The doc

444
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:53,408
The timekeeper

445
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,224
Calm down

446
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,248
People St

447
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:04,416
I'm wondering if that's a reference Maxwell keeper

448
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:10,816
How could you resist being like I named the squats

449
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,144
Zipcar

450
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,216
Yeah yeah it's pretty good I was pretty good

451
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:23,872
Can't argue with that all the sudden he's got an ambassador and Carries naming an episode The Ambassador like that

452
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:24,640
That's just

453
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:30,272
Like it if you accepted all of this is real then carries got to be feeling like well

454
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,296
This watch

455
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:37,440
Knows that I came up with that name likes it and is totally absolutely

456
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:43,840
Inadvertently become a member of this watch tribe

457
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:46,144
Subway

458
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,984
Sobered had to get out of the United States for a very specific reason

459
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,008
It was actually

460
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,288
The Air Force

461
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,080
That sound

462
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:56,384
And they weren't even looking for

463
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,272
A different UFOs

464
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,856
SWAT with LL database

465
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,744
But because

466
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,328
The US government's relationship with

467
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,096
Draco

468
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,680
We know we knew

469
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:21,984
We knew that there was going to be

470
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:24,544
Struggle

471
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,336
Just narrative

472
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,128
Because

473
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,152
Watch husband

474
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:31,712
Hunted Hunted

475
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:36,320
We wanted to remove Swatch from being in the middle

476
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,856
Odac struggle

477
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,904
So we did that

478
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:44,000
Went to Israel because several of us

479
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,024
Qualified

480
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:47,072
For the right of return

481
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,912
Easily

482
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:51,936
Did the squad

483
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,216
But that was always

484
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,240
Formality

485
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:57,824
And we were kept on the very short leash here

486
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,360
Another ground-based

487
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,432
Now that Facebook

488
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,992
Israeli government

489
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,552
Unfortunately

490
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,856
We came to an end

491
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,648
A Batman

492
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:16,256
Equinox

493
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,304
So we had to

494
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:27,776
I'm sorry if you're not willing to pay an extra 200 month then we've got another person he says it's not financially

495
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:34,176
Nature the inability to resign the lease let me squat broke something but like

496
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:40,576
I love it is a really grounded explanation

497
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:46,976
We lost the least we lost that you know I was going to tell you that you can cuz it's b******* okay

498
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:47,744
Bulshit

499
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:54,144
They had a API with a decibel meter right outside of our f****** underground house

500
00:28:54,400 --> 00:29:00,544
1 DB / 110

501
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:06,944
Problems watch like to party

502
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,480
So

503
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:12,576
Here is one of the points where I think that you really easy get these

504
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:13,344
Aspect

505
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:18,976
Of what I do think that this influence is positive it in this space space

506
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:21,792
Can I just pause you there and ask you

507
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,584
You know and I guess

508
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,632
There's some things you can talk about maybe

509
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:27,424
In more detail and some unless

510
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,192
So

511
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:31,008
In this situation when you say that

512
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:31,776
The least came

513
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:32,800
And you couldn't

514
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:33,568
Negotiate

515
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,360
Continuance so

516
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,152
Why couldn't

517
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,176
You continue

518
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:40,480
Is it a question of money was it a question

519
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:41,504
New Politics

520
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,528
Was there actually

521
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,576
Something behind-the-scenes motivating the

522
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,344
The change

523
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,624
Wasn't money

524
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:52,000
If it had to do with

525
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,584
Washington wants

526
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,632
Dependent on any government

527
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:00,960
ENT word you know in between the time that we

528
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,496
Spell Swatch actually.

529
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:04,032
Somewhat uncooperative

530
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,056
Rally's

531
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,872
And so

532
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:08,640
That

533
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:10,688
Color transfer onto US

534
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:15,552
Now is that because the Israelis are

535
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,600
I'm not sure how you want

536
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,976
I think there are closely related to the Anunnaki isn't that relationship

537
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:23,744
Or is it

538
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,048
You know

539
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,840
It is without that like

540
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,888
The underlined with made squats

541
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,168
Not walk

542
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,192
Operative

543
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:34,496
Or was their demands made that

544
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,520
That's watchwood

545
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,824
There are

546
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:41,664
By ranking Anunnaki in the Australian

547
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,224
Israelis

548
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:44,992
Selves

549
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:46,784
Anymore

550
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,416
Certainly ask

551
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,184
Fry's

552
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,280
Same way that like

553
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:58,304
There are

554
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,328
Some

555
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,864
Governments are with

556
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,656
Supposed to try to organize

557
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:10,080
You got to you got Carrie trying to say Israelis are related to the Anunnaki more closely

558
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:16,480
And Berg is coming in know there are some Anunnaki

559
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:20,064
That happened to be exist within the Israeli government

560
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:25,184
But that has nothing to do with the people that are important

561
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,280
To be able to to bring to this because I think that gets blurred so much

562
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:31,840
In the conversation again with the

563
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:38,240
This simple and easy categorizing of people

564
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,776
Sabates like listen

565
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:46,176
Because some of Anunnaki and Juice f***** 100 years ago it doesn't mean that all the sudden there's a

566
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,712
Racing going on

567
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:48,992
That's all it is

568
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:52,320
Mister people f***** a while back that's it be end

569
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:57,440
Well to carry that means that they're more Anunnaki

570
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,720
Well

571
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:01,792
So bird came back to the United States

572
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:05,888
But part of his job now is doing this with Carrie

573
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,168
They we needed

574
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:09,472
Did you get out from under the shadow of the Anunnaki

575
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,360
The Anunnaki or not

576
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,640
Reliable

577
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,432
And

578
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:19,712
We

579
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:22,016
Knew that this relay

580
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,368
Fortunately

581
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,184
My Handler

582
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,512
You're in

583
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,280
States

584
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,560
Work table

585
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:39,936
My card all that I should be allowed back

586
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:43,520
We do with supervision obvious

587
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:45,056
I don't have

588
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:49,408
Part of me

589
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,432
Condition

590
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:54,016
I need to be

591
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:56,320
Doing these sorts of interviews I need

592
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:58,112
Managing the Public Relation

593
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:02,976
Supposed to be

594
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,840
Okay

595
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,632
So that that sounds

596
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,936
On the one hand The Americans

597
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,472
Want you to do whenever

598
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:16,032
On the other hand they're not happy about

599
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:16,800
The fact that you need

600
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:22,688
If they're going to be interviews they want to make sure it's me in control of the

601
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:24,992
IC

602
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:31,392
Not letting anybody else note get in on his game and possibly ruin it

603
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:36,000
Squats

604
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:39,584
On this show if you carry it starts talkin Squatch

605
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:46,240
The American government will stop then that is how it works here man anybody

606
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:50,848
Claiming to be with black Kraken

607
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:54,176
I'm the ambassador's Ambassador that's what's happening now

00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,632
Runs into it is an issue

611
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:16,448
Don't do your bosses hate me like

612
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,312
Messenger

613
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,592
Christian because

614
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,896
You know I'm off

615
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:26,432
Considered

616
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,504
You know persona non grata by

617
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,552
American Military knife

618
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:32,576
Depends what

619
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,344
Branch

620
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:37,440
And of course

621
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,464
Different branches

622
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,000
That other Journal

623
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,072
And so

624
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,352
You did you run up

625
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,632
It against.

626
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:46,400
It kind of an issue

627
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,168
Issue

628
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,216
No actually the

629
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:51,264
The people who I deal with

630
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,800
Like my colonel

631
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,848
They are familiar with your work

632
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:56,128
And they are not

633
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,920
Mainstream

634
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,200
They are

635
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,992
Call Lovett

636
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:03,040
Nice

637
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,160
Space Program because their Acts

638
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,440
Multiple different

639
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:11,488
Space Program

640
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:12,256
Aesthetically

641
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:15,584
Oh my God

642
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:19,424
I enter your space and I carve out my space

643
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,008
And at the same time I make sure that the walls are so thick

644
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:25,312
No one can enter my space in your space

645
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:31,712
That's Fantastic Beasts face is a boss he likes you

646
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:37,088
And you like me. Yep we're done this is this is such

647
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:39,136
Clinical manipulation

648
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:45,536
It isn't as if I don't know if it's manipulation as much as ingratiate you know

649
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:51,936
Whenever cbp's does it is malicious manipulation and I think this is just actually being good

650
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:55,520
A nice conversational person and a very similar results

651
00:35:55,776 --> 00:36:01,920
Yeah yeah just hopefully you want to use this in roadway

652
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:02,944
Carrie 2

653
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:03,712
Tell her

654
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:04,992
Better I like

655
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:10,368
Events didn't happen after something 20 years

656
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:14,720
Oh boy funniest bird ripped off a mask

657
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:17,280
Carrie wants to know

658
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:23,936
If you works for the real president of the United States of course is dropped

659
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:25,216
Space force

660
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:26,752
Oh and I

661
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:28,288
Or airforce

662
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,056
I guess

663
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,080
If there's a

664
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,104
The distinction now

665
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,896
And is this

666
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:33,664
Biker 2

667
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,432
Receipt

668
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,456
Are you able to

669
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:37,248
I mean I understand there's

670
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,112
Is Trump

671
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,672
The fact that he's commander-in-chief

672
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:45,440
And remain

673
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:46,464
.

674
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,000
Since the election

675
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:50,560
And the fact that Biden is not

676
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,864
Are you doing your negotiations

677
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,168
With a group that is under Trump

678
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,216
Or this other

679
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:58,496
What appears

680
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:00,544
To be a sort of split normal

681
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:01,824
Under

682
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:03,616
Are we

683
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,384
Keep ourselves

684
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,152
Precept

685
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:06,688
Partisan

686
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:09,248
Because our concerns

687
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,016
Really are not

688
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:14,112
To do with Earthly matters not terrestrial

689
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,392
What do I give a s***

690
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:18,720
Distinctions like in Democratic and Republican

691
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,280
Don't really make a lot of

692
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:22,560
Space

693
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:27,168
That should be the simplest from space

694
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:28,960
Is Spacek

695
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:36,896
I had a good laugh when that was an hour

696
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,944
You know everyone in the know kind of

697
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:39,968
It was very bad

698
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,248
I'll say that

699
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,528
It was a matter moment

700
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,344
Because it already exists

701
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:51,744
Exactly is that Republicans don't make sense in space

702
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:58,144
There's a poetry to it

703
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:03,008
No no doubt about it there's a couple couple poetic

704
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,336
Little

705
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,360
This

706
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:09,408
Is an expression of something that

707
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:12,224
Takes care of a giant problem for Julio

708
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,808
In terms of having to talk about like Petty Earth politics

709
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:19,392
Like if you had to get bogged down in that with your

710
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:21,440
That story that you're spending

711
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:27,840
Hey it's it it might be too much of a hassle

712
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:34,240
Absolutely it is such a thing that must throw Carrie for a little bit of a loop

713
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:40,640
We're because so many other people so much and so many other people on her show or like happy to get into

714
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:47,040
That you don't care about the midterm right you know that kind of just say what should be the most obvious

715
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:47,808
Figure the world

716
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:50,880
If you are in space

717
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:52,160
Who gives a f***

718
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:58,816
That seems very very simple has a like a bit of a anthropologist

719
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:05,216
Drive to replace so distance

720
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:09,568
But literally from the subject that you are not sensibly studying

721
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,640
That is that's good storytelling

722
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:17,248
So you deliver underground with watch in Israel and that was tough

723
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,528
Did they

724
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:25,184
I have a line painted between one half of the Roku device

725
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,232
They lived in Lake

726
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:33,888
Human places and there was a big enclosure for a squat

727
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:40,288
Oh that's nice that you're going to read that to somebody else quite frankly with the leaf

728
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:44,128
Pacific building pretty Nisha

729
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,688
Especially hard on SWAT

730
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:47,712
Wasp

731
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,040
Then we are

732
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:55,904
But sparket have an artificial habitat down there is

733
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,184
It's just the same

734
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,976
Problem for me I was a headache

735
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,280
Chick-fil-A

736
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:04,096
So since I've been

737
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:04,864
Upstairs

738
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,984
I really enjoyed taking walks outside I am disabled

739
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,312
Tobacco

740
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:15,872
Love it

741
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:16,896
Phuc yea

742
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:23,552
Black lion trying to treat this as a newly song

743
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:31,232
So what do you tell is that that is smoking Black and Milds

744
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:35,328
All the things actually this is important because

745
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:41,728
Later in the interview he's very conspicuously rolling a shilling

746
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:48,128
A cigarette a soft very clearly doing

747
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:50,944
Buying Black & Mild

748
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,016
Okay

749
00:40:54,272 --> 00:41:00,416
Slow but very clearly smokes

750
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:03,744
Interview towards the end it was

751
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:07,840
It's a little bit weird I was like why

752
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:12,960
What are you doing why isn't anybody before

753
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:18,848
That is that is that should not be as groundbreaking for a space show as it

754
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:25,248
Does seem to be somebody should have been doing something or at least / paraphernalia all around getting Doug

755
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:28,832
With Carrie

756
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:34,720
Terry and Berg have different views on it

757
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:36,000
Okay now

758
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:38,560
It seems kind of like a tragedy

759
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,840
That's watches

760
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:40,864
Is planning to leave the

761
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,400
The planet show

762
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:44,192
Can you talk about how that's cuz

763
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:48,032
I could understand why

764
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:51,360
You or other

765
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,384
Your people

766
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,199
Ear mites

767
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,735
Consider that raggedy

768
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:00,831
My feelings about it are bitters

769
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,111
Because

770
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:05,183
Cheap clothes

771
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:05,951
Friend of mine

772
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:08,511
But I'm happy

773
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:12,351
You know he mentioned

774
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,399
He is very young

775
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,679
41

776
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:16,703
8 Ball

777
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:17,727
And he really

778
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,775
You know hasn't had a lot of life

779
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:25,919
Amor universe

780
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:29,503
So I'm glad that he was able to find

781
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:30,271
People

782
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,599
Have the resources

783
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:34,879
Is

784
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,183
Broken development

785
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:42,047
As a humanoid being

786
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:44,095
Squats kind of has a thing

787
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:45,119
Where is

788
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,911
Piano Berg has this

789
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:53,311
I am a game friends with this Guy Fieri I'm happy for him being able to reunite with his people

790
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:59,711
The classic Drew Barrymore e.t. situation this is it this is of course a Bittersweet goodbye

791
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:03,295
The man needs to go the Squatch needs to go home of course

792
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:09,695
Everybody made will never be forgotten right right you'll always be able to contact the Ambassador tell

793
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:16,095
Telepathically up at the stars I can barely get the grass from the overmind and then I know

794
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:22,495
Squatch is there the ambassador's waiting for me as always

795
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:24,031
Looking out for me

796
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:30,431
But I think this is this is one of the things that that gets into this difference

797
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:36,831
AMV mentalities the the robustness and richness of the view of the culture

798
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:41,183
There is the individuality that is allowed for

799
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:42,975
Alien beings

800
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:45,535
And I think that it's it's

801
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:51,679
Not that different in that he's just making up stuff about space right you know but Izzy's

802
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:52,959
Very different

803
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:54,239
And how

804
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:57,055
You would have approached these topic

805
00:43:57,311 --> 00:44:03,455
Well I mean pop culture has you think about independence day or or

806
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,991
Movies about El Clarin

807
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:09,855
It is not dealt with ethically at all as to whether or not we should be

808
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:12,415
Dissecting aliens and s*** you know

809
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:16,511
It is not put together for anybody that do that we should

810
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:21,375
Absolutely not be 28 this this is fuckedupshit we should try it you know anything else

811
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:27,263
And so it is it is reasonable for most of her guests to constantly be like all we studied these

812
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,543
These aliens

813
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:34,943
As though they were nothing to be studied something to be engaged with

814
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:36,735
Just be a feeling of like it's Payback

815
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:39,807
Because the greys

816
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:40,575
I don't know

817
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:43,903
So we're going to get into the history of Mars here in a moment

818
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,695
We need to talk about Mars

819
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:47,743
About 11 months

820
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:48,767
I spent there

821
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:50,303
Discovered

822
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,375
Because I think your listener

823
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:55,935
Deserve to know

824
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:00,031
You know what their tax dollars have been

825
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:03,103
Over there

826
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,383
I want to go back

827
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,151
Because

828
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:07,455
Mars's history is very poor

829
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:08,991
It's important under

830
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:10,271
Colonial

831
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:15,903
Hiiraan

832
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:19,999
Mars Casablanca

833
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,279
It does today

834
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:27,167
Wow wow it is so much like

835
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:30,751
You or Alyssa dead-end history class is good

836
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,799
Four people in reality

837
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:39,199
To know about history people are just unwilling to engage with reality maybe we need to have made

838
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:43,551
History that allows them to understand colonialism Blu-ray the rest of us do

839
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:49,951
Like I have to do you have to create like a completely like this isn't 121

840
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:56,351
This is not I'm not talkin about what you think I'm talking to Leopold the please

841
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:04,287
See when they murder the Aboriginal people and steal their land what do we call that

842
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:07,103
Alright thank you

843
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,663
Yeah space makes more interesting

844
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:16,319
So he started planning his first mission and getting into this whole thing back in 2010 and this is why

845
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:18,879
Where was like yeah this is

846
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:20,415
Obviously

847
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,207
Start of the beginning

848
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:22,975
So

849
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:24,767
Back in 2000

850
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,071
I was a younger man

851
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:29,375
And I spent

852
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:31,935
Franny and

853
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:32,703
Harry

854
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,727
Space

855
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,543
This was under the arm

856
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:38,335
A project

857
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:43,967
Was

858
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,527
This Mission by

859
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:48,063
Mi carnal

860
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:49,343
Lionel Sperling

861
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:58,815
Goes on there that he's not aware

862
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,399
Backpacks on the subway

863
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:04,447
Itrain

864
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:05,471
Where

865
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:11,615
I mentioned him before Daniel and

866
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:16,991
Jordan was Richard Stockton for BBQ

867
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:19,295
Alright

868
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:33,887
Yeah I think that Daniel Jordan is pretty clear but also you tonight bility

869
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:40,287
It's a fairly common name yeah using Alex's middle name as the middle name

870
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:46,687
I was like alright a hundred percent sure on this now he was disappointed

871
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:54,879
You guys really weren't one hundred percent certain on that one's fine I'll f****** up the ante

872
00:47:55,135 --> 00:48:01,279
I'll hold your hand I'll spoon-feed you

873
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:04,095
I don't know if I want to do another episode because it could be like

874
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:07,935
Blowing up his fire if you did

875
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:14,335
Want us to realize this is what he was doing

876
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:17,919
So he went to into space in 2011

877
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:19,711
And it was boring

878
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:23,039
The trip there was so boring

879
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,831
In January

880
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:25,855
2011

881
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:27,647
I

882
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:28,415
Or dead

883
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,207
A transport Rock

884
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:34,047
Lower

885
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:36,095
He was stationed in

886
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:38,399
Small spaces

887
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:39,679
Facebook

888
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:42,239
And from there

889
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:44,031
Snow Moon

890
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:45,311
Orbital shuttle

891
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:46,591
2

892
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:47,359
Mall

893
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:49,663
Black break-ins

894
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,735
Nice pen

895
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:54,271
Four-wheeler

896
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:55,807
On that route

897
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,087
Traveling

898
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:58,623
From Earth

899
00:48:58,879 --> 00:48:59,391
Mars

900
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:02,975
But some relative

901
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:06,559
We did not go interdimensional we did not

902
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:15,263
This was a fusion pulse driven

903
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,031
Spacecraft

904
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:18,335
We were able to get to Mars

905
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:19,103
About 4

906
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:21,407
It was a

907
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:22,687
Boring

908
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:24,735
This was not

909
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:25,503
Starship

910
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:27,551
I was

911
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:28,831
Smelly bunk room

912
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:30,111
Marines

913
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:31,647
The Meg has

914
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:35,231
And I read a lot paperback novels

915
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:36,511
Ochre

916
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:38,303
It was

917
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:39,839
Really

918
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:41,887
One of the most

919
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:43,423
Trivial month

920
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:49,567
See I think that this kind of thing is really good for the storytelling show

921
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:52,895
You know this would be such an opportunity to add

922
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:56,479
Like weird just decoration to the story

923
00:49:56,735 --> 00:50:01,855
Opportunity to take a swing and instead you know

924
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:08,255
You know you let it pass and get a ball or whatever that's that's good

925
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:12,095
When you think about

926
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:17,471
The the different type of improv that we get from so many of these guests it's always like

927
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:23,871
Everything is exciting everything is that thing that instantaneous bit you want to hear

928
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:29,759
I always know and there's a couple times where he's like I don't really know

929
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:36,159
That's outside of what I would know

930
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:37,439
Thanks to just like

931
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:39,231
Not do the thing

932
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:44,095
It's pretty it's pretty powerful in terms of making this seem more

933
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:50,495
Like it's an actual store absolutely like I mean it is the way to look at the

934
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:51,775
The journey

935
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:55,103
The same as any f******

936
00:50:55,871 --> 00:51:02,015
Marine from Hawaii

937
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:04,063
E2 Vietnam or whatever it is

938
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:09,695
It's not an exciting journey to get their imagine it's the same thing but for weeks

939
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:16,095
You know that's what it would be you won't even be able to look out the window and guess what what it was still

940
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:22,495
So even boring when he got there tomorrow

941
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:24,287
I was exhausted

942
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,567
Lost it I was tired

943
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:27,359
And I had

944
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:28,895
Processing

945
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,431
+ 6

946
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,967
Several hours

947
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:34,271
Orientation videos about Aldi

948
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,807
Battle

949
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:37,087
Hazards

950
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,111
On Mars

951
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:39,391
So

952
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:41,439
You do dealing with pure aqua

953
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:42,463
After that

954
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:45,791
Then

955
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,327
You're taken to a lot

956
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:48,863
You're giving your Crestor

957
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:51,679
Givens mother

958
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:52,959
Survival gear

959
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:55,263
Wade for golf cart

960
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:57,567
And take you to your

961
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:00,383
So I was taken to a base

962
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:03,199
I stowed my things

963
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:05,247
Was given another Warrior

964
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:06,015
Mutation

965
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,551
You know where the

966
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:10,879
Toilet was located in the mess all the other

967
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:11,903
Celanese

968
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:15,487
And then they asked me if I was ready

969
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:16,511
Dig-site

970
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:18,303
And I said I was

971
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,887
And I got back on the golf cart

972
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:24,191
We went over to the face

973
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:28,543
And

974
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:30,335
Capital letters

975
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:31,103
Mars

976
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:33,919
And be nice.

977
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:37,247
That means

978
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:38,783
Deep down

979
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:39,807
Into another

980
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:47,231
What's the face on Mars literal face on Mars that we're going to assume

981
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:53,631
Do now is actually a face yes but humanoids underneath it is a cavern

982
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:56,959
Ripe

983
00:52:57,215 --> 00:53:01,823
4 discoveries

984
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:09,247
I wasn't thinking about that way tonight

985
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:10,527
Filthy

986
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:13,599
So he had to spelunk into the cave with his team

987
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:18,975
Is Daniel Emerick Jordan wasn't enough this is where that guy this is overkill.

988
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:19,999
And I

989
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:21,023
Pretty much had

990
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:22,815
Belong down there with

991
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:24,607
My gear on my back

992
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:27,423
With my team

993
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:29,471
In order

994
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:30,751
At 2

995
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:32,799
What we called the

996
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:33,567
Stella's

997
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:35,359
So

998
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:37,151
Steelers

999
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:39,711
With glitch

1000
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:42,271
Which were B1

1001
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:43,551
Computer Mesa

1002
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:46,111
And they wanted

1003
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:47,647
Archaeologists and

1004
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:49,439
Be able

1005
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:50,719
Contextual cues

1006
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:54,559
Process

1007
00:53:58,143 --> 00:53:59,679
So I was part of a

1008
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:01,727
Scheme of dozens of stash

1009
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:04,799
I mentioned Daniel Jordan

1010
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:06,591
What's my research assistant

1011
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:08,895
I had a bodyguard there who also

1012
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:12,735
This was a young Marine

1013
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:13,759
Beyond the saline

1014
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:18,879
Crazy girl lucky as Hell by lives

1015
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:22,719
Oh my God

1016
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:29,887
Pretty almond eyes

1017
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:38,335
Bcap aliens are like archaeologists they like digging in litter boxes isn't that like kind of

1018
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:41,407
Is there characterization in past episodes

1019
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:47,807
The I thought they were more characterized in that language not really doing

1020
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:52,159
That much I don't I don't know I think they I think they might be archaeologist

1021
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:56,255
It's at the feline Contessa I know is

1022
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:58,559
Something about

1023
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:04,959
I don't know I can't recall my cat now exist in the

1024
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:11,871
You hear that Celine what a weird thing that that goes whenever you make choices

1025
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:18,271
Little while back you were out of space

1026
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:22,367
Here we are with even let's take it back

1027
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:28,767
Do you know years before that I decided that I was going to get a cat even though my apartment didn't

1028
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:40,287
What a crazy Journey life is like that trip to Mars

1029
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:43,103
Boring as hell

1030
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:44,639
Weeks at least

1031
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:51,295
So carry here's what happens here has pictures of the glyphs or his drawings easy

1032
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:57,695
Made of glass you can't see them on the screen notebook

1033
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:59,743
Like images and she's like wait a second

1034
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:01,023
You owe me some pictures

1035
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:03,839
You do owe me

1036
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:05,887
Amish last time

1037
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:10,239
Yes so I wanted to

1038
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:12,287
Based on that

1039
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:14,847
Watch

1040
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:16,383
Does not

1041
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:18,175
Photo grid

1042
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:20,479
He is very concerned about

1043
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:30,463
Oh my God

1044
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:35,583
So I apologize okay that's a perfect explanation

1045
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:42,239
Why can't you provide a picture flask watch won't allow it is worried about facial recognition software

1046
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:44,287
You can't get around it

1047
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:45,567
God

1048
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:48,639
Play Take a squeaky you pictures watch

1049
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:51,455
Possible explanation

1050
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:54,783
Facial recognition software

1051
00:56:55,039 --> 00:57:01,183
God that's so great well it's so grateful recognition software could be used to hunt down other Squad

1052
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:02,719
Watches out there

1053
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:09,119
Don't you remember other squashes are there

1054
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:13,727
Kashyyyk I'm not too worried about people mistaking Chewbacca for the wrong person

1055
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:19,359
Or facial recognition software picking Tupac out from the crowd that's not our thing man

1056
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:21,151
Call Cher

1057
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:27,551
Some of the swatches aren't as harried nobody's sure they do shape

1058
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:35,231
Yeah that it's

1059
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:41,631
This is an explanation that you can except there's no way around that

1060
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:48,031
Second it's making it I call that's my fault I promise that before running it by Squatch

1061
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:54,431
Of course you know I'm sorry I got a little too excited a reasonable explanation

1062
00:57:54,687 --> 00:58:00,831
And I just I just think of Harry and the Hendersons having a fake facial recognition software subplot

1063
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:07,231
It's exciting and also a really bad idea bring it back for one-time special

1064
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:08,255
Show episode

1065
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:10,047
To Harry to Henderson

1066
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:13,631
Silk gets out of control beef glyphs

1067
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:15,679
And they revealed something

1068
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:17,215
Betty's

1069
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:18,239
Earthshatter

1070
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:21,823
I mean literally earth-shattering well that is being play

1071
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:24,127
History will never be the same

1072
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:26,431
Mars has been

1073
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:29,759
Thousands of years

1074
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:31,807
So

1075
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:35,135
This is part of what I discovered when I was there because when we

1076
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:35,903
So

1077
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:38,207
Humans are not the only

1078
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:39,999
Intelligent life

1079
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:42,559
Present on Mars currently Oregon

1080
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:44,863
X

1081
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:45,887
Starboard

1082
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:47,679
In that sub Tavern

1083
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:48,959
So I'm I'm safe

1084
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:49,727
Facebook

1085
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:54,847
And I'm thinking okay

1086
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:56,639
This has to be the remains

1087
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:57,919
The ruins of an alien

1088
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:00,735
Let the remains

1089
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:01,759
The fossil remains

1090
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:03,295
Sound

1091
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:04,831
Bistro in

1092
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:06,367
Workhuman

1093
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:09,439
So

1094
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:12,511
It was really a watershed moment

1095
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:14,815
Standing down there

1096
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:15,839
In this cold

1097
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:18,655
Realizing

1098
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:20,959
We were in North Dakota

1099
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:22,495
Mars

1100
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:28,895
Humans have been on Mars for so long throwing out we're throwing out humans were on

1101
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:30,687
Mars first came to Earth

1102
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:32,735
No and then forgot about Mars

1103
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:36,063
We're not doing that one

1104
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:40,927
We're saying that we independently evolved on Mars simultaneously okay

1105
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:42,463
At some

1106
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:44,767
Points

1107
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:51,167
Okay see that's where we're at 70,000 years ago to this

1108
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:54,495
The history is what we're going to learn about

1109
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:57,055
You are like ancestors of humans

1110
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:58,079
What tomorrow

1111
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:03,455
And that's where they they

1112
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:04,479
Yeah

1113
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:07,551
Atlantis is involved but we'll get a little bit

1114
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:11,647
Now I'm now we're talkin there was a reason though that they were brought

1115
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:12,671
To Mars

1116
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:14,463
It wasn't just for fun and games

1117
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:16,511
It wasn't you know

1118
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:22,911
Remind me to 4 concerned about wasting faster-than-light fuel just to get there then yeah oh there's no reason to

1119
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:24,447
To bring people if they're not used

1120
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:30,079
No there was there was there was there was an issue that needed to solve

1121
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:33,919
So do you remember in the first year we did I mention

1122
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:34,943
You.

1123
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:36,223
In free hats

1124
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:38,527
History prior to about 70,000

1125
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:39,551
Vertigo

1126
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:42,623
Humanity was much more genetically diverse

1127
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:44,927
And that actually win

1128
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,207
A geneticist

1129
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:49,535
Look at you man

1130
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:50,303
Today

1131
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:53,887
There's a lot of missing genetic diversity

1132
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:55,167
Humans are pretty much

1133
01:00:58,495 --> 01:01:01,055
We don't diaper medically that must occur each other

1134
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:02,079
Because we're all

1135
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:03,871
The descendants of a handful

1136
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:04,895
Survivors

1137
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:08,735
Who were left over from the environment

1138
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:09,759
Cataclysm.

1139
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:17,439
The kingdom of Atlantis

1140
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,719
Was active on Mars

1141
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:21,791
Now we're a different era

1142
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:23,839
Cro-Magnon

1143
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:24,607
And other can

1144
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:25,375
Temporary

1145
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:26,143
Humans

1146
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:28,447
Who were dying off

1147
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:30,495
From Earth

1148
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:31,263
Chew bars

1149
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:32,287
As a laborer

1150
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:38,687
Okay

1151
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:42,271
Working class caveman.

1152
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:44,319
And there was no going back

1153
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:45,343
Which was a lie

1154
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:48,415
And

1155
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:50,207
These

1156
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:52,511
Primitive humans

1157
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:54,303
On Mars

1158
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:56,863
Modern

1159
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:58,399
Modern Hyundai

1160
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:02,751
Social complexity and ingenuity

1161
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:05,823
Baby

1162
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:06,591
Game

1163
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:08,127
The new working-class

1164
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:08,895
Mars

1165
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:09,919
Replace

1166
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:11,967
Original work

1167
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:14,783
Google Talkback

1168
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:17,087
Which are I'm an insect

1169
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:23,231
Dies it turns out the issue was that The Troggs weren't creative or adaptive

1170
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:29,631
Okay the worker class that was needed on Mars

1171
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:31,167
Cro-mags and ask

1172
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:37,567
Humanoids were brought in by the atlanteans Mars

1173
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:39,359
To a foreign land

1174
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:45,759
Tour people from their homes and then brought them into a labor classes stubs you might

1175
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:52,159
Some parallels of

1176
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:54,719
Sewer sewer

1177
01:02:54,975 --> 01:03:01,119
So what created this Colony on Mars

1178
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:01,887
Creating like

1179
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:03,167
A welcoming mat

1180
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:09,567
For the Milky Way was still originated on Earth in this in this

1181
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:10,591
Storyline here

1182
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:16,991
Bright Atlantis was originally Mars and then

1183
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:22,623
Is our story goes today might as well originate on Earth

1184
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:29,279
They are alien hybrids who are in Atlanta

1185
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:35,423
Okay anyway they wanted to create a welcoming mat for the Milky Way has Bass

1186
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:37,727
So Atlantis was a multi

1187
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:39,263
Community

1188
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:42,079
The atlanteans

1189
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:43,103
Were

1190
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:44,639
1 of a number

1191
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:45,407
Island

1192
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:47,455
Of the glass

1193
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:48,223
Federer age

1194
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:49,759
Galactic Federation

1195
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:52,063
Created a colony on Mars

1196
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:53,087
Dad

1197
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:54,367
Serta became the milk

1198
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:56,927
There was a key

1199
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:57,951
Something called

1200
01:03:58,207 --> 01:03:59,231
Stargate

1201
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:01,535
Stargate

1202
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:04,863
Used to be in orbit of

1203
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:06,399
The fifth planet

1204
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:07,679
Solar system

1205
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:08,703
No longer exist

1206
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:11,519
But this was Stargate that permitted

1207
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:13,311
Ships travel from the edge

1208
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:14,079
Ramen

1209
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:17,151
Mars was this

1210
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:18,943
Advanced Auto

1211
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:20,223
Bouncy World

1212
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:20,991
And

1213
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:22,783
All the number

1214
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:24,575
Planets of the Galactic Federation

1215
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:30,719
Stallard

1216
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:33,023
Craftsman

1217
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:34,303
They are

1218
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:35,839
Finest Warriors

1219
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:37,631
But the Draco

1220
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:41,471
Although they were members of Federation

1221
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:42,751
Shaded what Mars

1222
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:44,543
And they

1223
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:45,567
Opera

1224
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:46,335
Unity

1225
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:47,871
2

1226
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:48,639
Dump Derek

1227
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:51,199
So they send

1228
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:53,247
Criminal

1229
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:55,551
Political exile

1230
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:57,087
Mars

1231
01:04:58,111 --> 01:04:58,623
But

1232
01:04:59,135 --> 01:04:59,647
Those

1233
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:02,719
Those break Ellen Brock Boyd

1234
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:04,767
Form their own civilization

1235
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:06,815
And were able to

1236
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:08,351
You become part of the

1237
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:09,375
The grand are bars

1238
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:10,143
Community

1239
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:16,543
They are not defined by being the outcast of the Draco they can come into play

1240
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:21,919
Place and integrate their welcomed into this community and they can

1241
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:25,247
They can be productive members of the martian base

1242
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:30,623
This is Grace

1243
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:34,463
I mean like in terms of underlying message of it

1244
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:40,863
It's a good any other story about this would be like they come in and they're the ones who I mean really everything

1245
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:47,007
I mean the the implication whenever other guests on Project Camelot say that is that

1246
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:49,055
That is because they are those

1247
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:51,103
They send those

1248
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:53,407
Gross mutants and all of those stuff

1249
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:59,807
Because they are gross mutants because they are be anything other than

1250
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:03,903
Who have been defined as such right that is because they are sending again

1251
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:10,303
These kinds of things are immigrants Refugee analogs in the sort of

1252
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:11,071
Space talk

1253
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:13,119
And what have you and

1254
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:14,911
The notion of

1255
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:16,703
Embracing

1256
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:20,031
And welcoming in immigrants in recognizing

1257
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:24,895
The potential inability for people to to merge together

1258
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:27,711
Great prosperous societies is not something

1259
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:34,111
That you generally see in the story

1260
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:40,511
It's like the British came in tried to f*** everybody up and then they had to go to America

1261
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:43,839
It's fine

1262
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:50,239
Paint the river green. You should be a history teacher I'm fairly quick

1263
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:56,639
So that's 70,000 years ago the humans got brought in to be the worker class to replace The Troggs

1264
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:59,967
Naturally been about 68,000 years ago

1265
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:03,295
A l Rose was a bit of a demagogue

1266
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:05,087
It's 68.

1267
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:06,623
You're there about

1268
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:07,903
Which was

1269
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:08,927
No no

1270
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:09,951
It's the beginning of

1271
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:14,559
So Chris looks was that individual.

1272
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:18,143
Human Anunnaki hybrid who ascended to the position of

1273
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:19,423
Technocrat

1274
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:20,447
On bars

1275
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:22,239
And chrysalis

1276
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:25,055
One of the things

1277
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:26,591
He had to do in Oregon

1278
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:27,615
The mint

1279
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:28,383
Install

1280
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,663
As eater

1281
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:31,199
The Troggs

1282
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:32,735
Technocracy

1283
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:35,551
Was he engaged in a lure

1284
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:36,319
Struggle

1285
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:37,855
With the queen of the

1286
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:40,159
Frogs

1287
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:42,207
Are not very wise

1288
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:45,791
Weasel-like mask

1289
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:47,071
Organic

1290
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:47,839
Computers

1291
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:50,655
Information to her knowledge

1292
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:51,679
Brain bugs

1293
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:53,727
And yeah they have kind of

1294
01:07:57,055 --> 01:07:57,567
With

1295
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:58,591
The brainbox

1296
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:09,087
Alright so we we rap battle our way into the future and what we're trying to describe

1297
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:15,487
Deltron 3030 battle your enemies for hard

1298
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:19,583
Original conflict baby yeah so Chris Alex Rose

1299
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:20,607
And

1300
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:27,007
Needed to win over the trog naturally to be in order to be seeing as the ruler

1301
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:29,311
You did bring battle with brain bugs

1302
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:35,711
We'll get back to this this thread to consider that needs to be addressed weigh more because this

1303
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:42,111
Battle

1304
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:48,511
Crystalyx okay well but first we have to introduce another the Chrysalis Empire

1305
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:54,911
We have to introduce another character into the mix who exist in the present-day who Berg is friends

1306
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:55,679
Okay

1307
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:56,959
My understanding is

1308
01:08:57,215 --> 01:08:57,727
As I

1309
01:08:57,983 --> 01:09:01,311
Recall and a Randy Cramer talked about I think battling

1310
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:02,079
The Troggs

1311
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:03,103
Yes

1312
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:04,127
So

1313
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:06,687
There are still progs on Mars

1314
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:08,223
And our strongest

1315
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:11,039
But there are far fewer tribe highest

1316
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:15,135
I just like there are far fewer reptoids on

1317
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:18,207
Heather Storm

1318
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:18,975
Rascals

1319
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:21,535
It we're going to get into that

1320
01:09:22,047 --> 01:09:22,815
With Andheri

1321
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:24,351
Close terms

1322
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:26,655
With the leader of a

1323
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:27,679
Large number of

1324
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:32,031
I've mentioned

1325
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:34,335
We're going to talk about Drew

1326
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:38,431
Okay could you stay on

1327
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:39,711
Say his name a little more

1328
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:40,479

1329
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:42,783
Drew

1330
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:45,087
So I didn't know

1331
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:46,623
You do then I can only

1332
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:48,415
Spell it phonetically because obvious

1333
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:51,999
English

1334
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:52,767
Spelling it

1335
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:53,535
GRE

1336
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:58,143
So bruised

1337
01:09:59,167 --> 01:09:59,935
He's a warlock

1338
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:02,495
I presume he's still on

1339
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:03,775
I haven't spoken with him

1340
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:05,055
But if

1341
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:08,639
If anyone's in charge there I would have to be Hammond

1342
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:10,175
Yeah someone is

1343
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:10,943

Motor Inn

1348
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:21,951
Lizards

1349
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:22,975

Start of the warrior

1351

Remnants

1352
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:29,119
Of the rat poison

1353
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:29,887
Civilization

1354
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:31,679
Force

1355

Lifestyle

1356
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:34,751
By colonialist

1357
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:35,775
Approach

1358
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:42,431
He does compare this to Mad Max some point I think it's because it's too close to Madness

1359
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:48,831
Savannah condo

1360
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:55,231
Biker gang lizards

1361
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:58,559
Herbal country band I can see it

Yeah he's become he's friends with Drew the warlord with the

1363
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:07,775
Bike riding

1364
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:08,543
Rights

1365
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:09,823
Right I will get back to the

1366
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:16,223
That's not important for right now we have to get back to the threat of chrysalis

1367
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:22,623
Because we we need to nail down Martian history if we're going to be able to

1368
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:25,951
Understand the culture and the picture

1369
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:27,231
Betty

1370
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:34,655
Right so Chris Alex started getting this this power together

1371
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:37,727
And here's how he did that and what he did

1372
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:41,823
I told you about the ancient history of Mars how's the

1373
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:43,103
Working class

1374
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:44,639
Homosapien

1375
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:45,663
From Earth

1376
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:46,687
Transported there

1377
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:48,479
But

1378
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:51,551
Mars was

1379
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:54,111
Largely populated

1380
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:56,671
Started

1381
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:58,207
So

1382
01:11:58,719 --> 01:11:59,487
Chrysalis

1383
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:02,815
Engineer

1384
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:04,351
The Troggs

1385
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:05,375
Rat boy

1386
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:07,167
In order

1387
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:08,959
Violent

1388
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:12,543
Capitalize

1389
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:14,847
Fear of alien violence

1390
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:16,895
To unite

1391
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:18,431
Humanoid

1392
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:21,247
When you

1393
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:23,039
Take A Primitive people

1394
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:27,135
And you teach them how to read and write and use the

1395
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:28,159
Scenery

1396
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:31,487
You organize them as working

1397
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:34,559
And that's what happened

1398
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:36,863
Von Maur

1399
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:43,775
So the humans on Mars right I have been organized into a working-class causes some tension but

1400
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:46,079
Between The Troggs reptilian

1401
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:52,479
Yeah and Magog as a demagogues division

1402
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:58,879
Fear of aliens and all this which of course leads to devastating Wars

1403
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:05,279
John crystallic Society

1404
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:11,679
There is something that is at the root of all this tension for this blow your mind

1405
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:13,727
There was a laborer

1406
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:14,751
On Mars

1407
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:15,519
Because

1408
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:17,567
Did workers realize

1409
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:18,591
.

1410
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:19,359
They

1411
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:21,407
Could bargain collectively

1412
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:24,223
The better working

1413
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:26,015
Conditions

1414
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:28,831
Childcare

1415
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:30,623
They realize they're collect

1416
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:31,903
Labor power and that

1417
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:33,439
Created a political price

1418
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:34,719
Chrysalis

1419
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:35,487
Promise

1420
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:36,255
POF

1421
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:37,791
Select

1422
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:39,839
Technocrat

1423
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:42,399
On the basis of his promise

1424
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:43,423
Quavering

1425
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:45,727
Chris Alex is a union Buster

1426
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:51,103
I mean it does sound like Chrysalis and Howard Schultz have a lot in common

1427
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:54,687
Labor issue because

1428
01:13:54,943 --> 01:14:01,087
Bee Cave man who got brought toolbars relight the collective bargaining is powerful

1429
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:06,719
That is almost exactly dealing with unions their Chrysalis decided to go to war

1430
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:11,071
Yep that's just that's just the way it is man that is just

1431
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:12,863
It is it is

1432
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:15,423
So relatable and yet so

1433
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:16,191
Dark

1434
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:20,287
Dark to think that regardless of what planet you're on

1435
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:25,407
Possible to get past capitalism well like you just f****** do it

1436
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:30,015
It's not depressing.

1437
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:31,295
Unearthly got bucks

1438
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:37,695
Open space get Space by the end of the day it's all about the Benjamins space bunny

1439
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:39,487
Exactly

1440
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:46,655
Is a very different Networks

1441
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:49,471
So Carrie wants to know if crystalyx

1442
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:50,751
Was very tall

1443
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:54,079
Quick question about crystalyx

1444
01:14:54,335 --> 01:15:00,479
If I know the answer obviously is Chrysalis Chrysalis is Atlantean mix

1445
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:01,247
With

1446
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:03,807
Anunnaki not one of the human

1447
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:10,207
I believe elevated from the work now to

1448
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:16,351
From this is he was external to the group that came from Earth

1449
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:17,119
Okay

1450
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:20,703
Honey-roasted Supreme technigraph I should bring it back over the rainbow

1451
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:24,543
He was pretty tall too

1452
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:26,335
How tall was

1453
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:28,895
Chrysalis was

1454
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:31,199
Human he was about

1455
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:32,991
All

1456
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:35,039
Because

1457
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:36,831
He was mostly humanoid

1458
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:39,391
As we discussed some

1459
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:41,183
Anunnaki or more

1460
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:44,255
And there are many

1461
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:45,279
Groups today

1462
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:46,047
Claiming

1463
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:47,583
Bibiana Nakia

It's not

1465
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:49,375
Always

1466
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:50,655
Clear.

1467
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:52,191
All of them

1468
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:56,031
It's very popular

1469
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:57,311
You claim your on-and-off

1470
01:15:57,823 --> 01:15:59,103
It's sort of like a lot of white

1471
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:12,671
Okay

1472
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:19,583
So I said oh yeah what are you going to stay the night Carrie

1473
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:24,959
A lot of the aliens lie about beer out of Rocky to get street cred

1474
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:36,479
Why wouldn't they have course in Perry can't take s*** to that because it's like if she acknowledged

1475
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:41,087
About it all it's all up in the air at this point now it's like

1476
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:43,903
Wait a second are you saying that it's possible

1477
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:46,463
Now and hear me out on this one

1478
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:50,559
Some of my guests may have been claiming things that weren't true

1479
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:51,583
Maybe

1480
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:53,375
Alright

1481
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:00,543
That's true

1482
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:02,335
There's just no way to know not

1483
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:03,103
Yeah

1484
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:10,527
Mystery

1485
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:12,575
Chris Alex

1486
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:14,623
Needed to crush labor

1487
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:15,391
Of course

1488
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:16,671
Until he started a war

1489
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:18,207
Naturally there was a mass

1490
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:18,975
Cast of War

1491
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:19,999
That was

1492
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:21,023
Basically

1493
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:22,559
Precipitated by chrysalis

1494
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:25,375
Promising to do everything pause

1495
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:26,143
Possible to

1496
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:26,911
Stop

1497
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:28,191
The General

1498
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:28,959
Strike

1499
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:30,239
And the author

1500
01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:32,287
The general strike

1501
01:17:33,055 --> 01:17:34,335
Was Total War

1502
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:35,359
So

1503
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:36,639
There were

1504
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:37,663
Numbers

1505
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:38,687
Young

1506
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:39,711
Humans

1507
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:40,735
Scripted in

1508
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:42,015
Army of Mars

1509
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:45,855
Put in

1510
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:48,671
Units with

1511
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:51,487
Atlantic

1512
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:52,511
Strollers

1513
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:54,815
And they were

1514
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:55,839
First organized

1515
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:57,119
Militias.

1516
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:58,143
Stockton human

1517
01:17:58,399 --> 01:17:58,911
Settlement

1518
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:00,959
Indiscriminate

1519
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:02,239
Violence

1520
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:07,103
We organize

1521
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:08,127
As

1522
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:10,431
A singular Army

1523
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:11,455
That Wednesday

1524
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:12,223
War on

1525
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:16,575
So

1526
01:18:16,831 --> 01:18:17,343
Most

1527
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:19,903
The working-class humans

1528
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:21,695
Were conscripted

1529
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:22,719
Killed in that

1530
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:23,487
War

1531
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:24,511
And

1532
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:26,047
Mars was very

1533
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:28,095
Burberry

1534
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:29,119
I'm

1535
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:32,191
Until the 20th century

1536
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:39,871
So we're talking about 67 Thousand Years give or take

1537
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:51,135
Willingness to negotiate with labor I mean it does seem like that is the

1538
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:57,535
Ultimate 8.1 no matter where you're going if you can't negotiate with labor were again to eventually going to die

1539
01:18:57,791 --> 01:19:02,655
So we get to the 20th century and then more things start to happen

1540
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:03,935
Right on Mars

1541
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:04,959
McDonald's

1542
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:06,495
Opens their first rest

1543
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:12,639
Unclear if those corporations are allowed to operate on the Mars base

1544
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:15,711
A certain Drake

1545
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:21,087
Decided to go to Mars

1546
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:22,367
We're getting up to

1547
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:23,903
The point where I come in

1548
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:24,927
But allow me to

1549
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:26,463
Relaxer for a little bit longer

1550
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:30,559
Happens

1551
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:32,863
Right before work

1552
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:35,679
So

1553
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:36,959
Oh she's in

1554
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:38,239
Establish

1555
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:43,615
Free Woodward

1556
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:45,919
Travel to Mars

1557
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:48,735
And several large

1558
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:51,807
Verner Von Braun how we going to get there

1559
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:53,087
A large number of mill

1560
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:56,159
And Parma

1561
01:19:57,695 --> 01:19:58,207
SS

1562
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:01,279
Choose the surface

1563
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:02,815
Mars and built a colony

1564
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:06,399
Now you've heard of Operation Paperclip

1565
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:07,167
Right

1566
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:08,959
Ron

1567
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:10,495
Nazi

1568
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:13,567
Science fell into Allied hands after World War

1569
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,128
Public space

1570
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:17,920
Operation

1571
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:22,528
People know about what the secret right now

1572
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:24,832
The public Space Program

1573
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:28,928
What they don't realize what what

1574
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:30,208
Austin don't realize

1575
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:31,744
Is that

1576
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:38,144
Part of

1577
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:39,936
The transfer

1578
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:41,984
Science

1579
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:43,008
Allied hands

1580
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:44,800
Involve the deed

1581
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:45,568
Cinemark

1582
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:46,592
Gas

1583
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:47,872
Yeah

1584
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:50,432
So what deed

1585
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:54,272
And it's free

1586
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:55,808
To America

1587
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:57,088
Ownership

1588
01:20:57,856 --> 01:20:59,136
UK

1589
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:06,048
Transfer

1590
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:07,072
But a lot of

1591
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:08,864
What did German civilians

1592
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:10,656
Stay

1593
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:13,472
So

1594
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:15,264
When you look at Mars

1595
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,032
Today

1596
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:18,848
You'll notice that there's a lot

1597
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:20,640
German civilians

1598
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:21,664
Present

1599
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,456
Another European National

1600
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:27,552
The most eastern you will notice that if you look at Mars today

1601
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:29,856
Non-stop Biergarten

1602
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:36,256
Oh man it's just a nightmare it's just a nightmare in October everything is

1603
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:42,656
Just read it's not supposed to be Harvest colored god dammit

1604
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:49,056
The space speed was part of Project Paperclip

1605
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:53,664
Hopefully that makes so much sense

1606
01:21:53,920 --> 01:22:00,064
Thank you for that from being a Nazi base tickets was taken over

1607
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:04,672
Over by satellite speaker in Project

1608
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:05,440
Is

1609
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:11,840
Like that anchors it to reality in a way that's like that's solid and in one of the few

1610
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:13,632
Actual conspiracy kind of

1611
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:15,680
At least names

1612
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:17,728
Yeah along with

1613
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:23,104
Crazy ex if we took in Nazi rocket scientists

1614
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:29,504
Why wouldn't I why wouldn't take a bead

1615
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:32,064
Yeah I love the idea

1616
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,368
Because this is glossed over

1617
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:37,696
Carrie should have followed up on this but

1618
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:40,000
Are you telling me that Hitler

1619
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:43,328
I was like Hey listen we got to send all these people up tomorrow

1620
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:46,400
We got to make sure we have some SS agents are there

1621
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:48,192
To keep them in line is that

1622
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:50,752
Is that kind of the thought process behind that

1623
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:57,408
You're sending a colony of people to Mars and you include f****** secret police

1624
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:01,504
Also absurd also what happened to them

1625
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:07,904
Like where they tried I mean

1626
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:14,304
Where are Hillary's

1627
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:18,144
Brazil or you know the boys from Mars it's the same movie

1628
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,192
Brother is actually City Brazil

1629
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:23,776
That's scary

1630
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:30,176
HR stuff

1631
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:33,504
Within his first day though he went he went and visited the bazaar

1632
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:36,320
The market is

1633
01:23:36,832 --> 01:23:40,928
Basically I got the sense that it was

1634
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:41,696
Okay

1635
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:47,584
But it it's it's not dissimilar to The Cantina

1636
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,632
I went to a Bazaar

1637
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:51,680
Outside the base

1638
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:55,008
And

1639
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:58,592
That bizarre is frequency by number that

1640
01:23:58,848 --> 01:23:59,872
Extraterrestrial beings

1641
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:04,224
I actually got into

1642
01:24:06,016 --> 01:24:06,784
With a merkin

1643
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:12,160
And

1644
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:12,928
Pushy

1645
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:16,256
With a human

1646
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,328
Sex work

1647
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:21,120
Is legal

1648
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:22,656
Sex worker

1649
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:23,680
Union

1650
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:25,472
Rights

1651
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:29,568
Got a boo-boo

1652
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:31,872
Fly

1653
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:34,944
I have to stop you right there

1654
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:36,480
A Mercantile what

1655
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:41,088
Andonian

1656
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:45,184
Oh okay alright

1657
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:51,840
Carry them from your f****** self don't act like it's crazy

1658
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:04,896
It so don't try and be like all skeptical Mercantile dog that sounds a little unrealistic you shut

1659
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:07,968
It is illustrative of

1660
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:14,624
A non invested people are in maintaining their own mythology

1661
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:22,048
Address and I forgotten 100 things that we've talked about inside jokes.

1662
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:28,448
Yeah that 100% no idea I'm sure there are references in this two things that we've said in the past that I have

1663
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:34,080
I don't even get we have done several I mean at least almost $2,000

1664
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:38,432
That's too much to remember for any one person about it too much

1665
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:44,064
Impedes my ability to make tomorrow's episode you know like to make this real

1666
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:46,368
Crystalyx

1667
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:47,136
Yes

1668
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:53,792
Also this ends up resolving okay they get into a little bit of a fight that could have caused an Interstellar incident

1669
01:25:55,328 --> 01:26:01,472
Daniel Jordan and Sarah and German woman

1670
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:06,848
Could get away that is nice

1671
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:12,736
His War had long-standing implications and there's some troubles

1672
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:14,016
What was your abs

1673
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:14,784
Salute

1674
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:16,576
Clear-cut I mean

1675
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:17,600
Natsumi had something

1676
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:18,624
Clear cutting

1677
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:20,416
Had a beginning and an end

1678
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:21,696
So what was it

1679
01:26:22,464 --> 01:26:23,488
I was there

1680
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,280
As an archaeologist

1681
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:28,352
Paleo historical

1682
01:26:30,656 --> 01:26:31,936
My purpose

1683
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:32,704
Was

1684
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:33,472
2 Under

1685
01:26:33,728 --> 01:26:34,496
Stanza

1686
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:35,264
Nature of

1687
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:36,288
Conflict

1688
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:37,824
Era

1689
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:39,360
Okay

1690
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:40,384
Belabor Christ

1691
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:45,504
Led to Civil War on Mars

1692
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:49,088
She's four

1693
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:49,856
Yahtzee

1694
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:51,136
Populated Mars

1695
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:53,440
I

1696
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:54,208
Let's bury

1697
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:54,976
Sparse

1698
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:56,768
Almost uninhabitable

1699
01:26:57,536 --> 01:26:58,048
Stare

1700
01:26:58,304 --> 01:27:00,864
One of the things are unusual for March

1701
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:04,448
Was the Martian

1702
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:05,728
Live Water

1703
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:08,288
Extremely

1704
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:10,336
And that has a lot

1705
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:11,360
Do with the ACT

1706
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:12,128
Cavities

1707
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:15,200
Drew's and his water

1708
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:17,248
Oh that's the s***

1709
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:18,784
Before I got the bazaar

1710
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:19,552
On my

1711
01:27:20,064 --> 01:27:21,088
Day after having

1712
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:23,648
The human remains

1713
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:25,184
Cavern underneath

1714
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:26,208
The

1715
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:27,232
Facebook

1716
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:31,840
I came back up from the cavern

1717
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:33,376
We were surrounded

1718
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:36,960
We are surrounded by motorized

1719
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:37,728
Vehicles

1720
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:39,520
Is that were like a g

1721
01:27:41,824 --> 01:27:45,408
Wax together Gloria

1722
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:47,968
Warhorse

1723
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:49,504
War wagon

1724
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:52,320
Man's

1725
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:53,600
Bye

1726
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:54,368
Wizard

1727
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:55,648
I don't know what else

1728
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,976
I got to know them very well

1729
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:01,792
In my time there I spend a lot of

1730
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:07,168
Uncomfortable

1731
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:11,008
Now I'm I'm curious are you familiar with the Raptors

1732
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:14,848
He's burnt out Raptors I am familiar with Raptors

1733
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:22,272
These were no rap or Raptors lizards

1734
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:24,832
I appreciate her

1735
01:28:25,088 --> 01:28:26,112
Being like listen

1736
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:28,672
Lizards are bike absolutely

1737
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:35,328
What kind were they Raptors

1738
01:28:35,584 --> 01:28:39,680
Not worried about them riding motorcycles on Mars and being water Raider

1739
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:46,080
Not at all worried about that water Quest that they had is actually

1740
01:28:46,336 --> 01:28:47,360
Why they surrounded

1741
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:48,896
Robert

1742
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:52,224
Because they wanted that water and

1743
01:28:54,528 --> 01:28:56,832
Exchange fascinating

1744
01:28:58,624 --> 01:28:59,392
Surround you

1745
01:29:01,184 --> 01:29:02,464
Because they wanted our water

1746
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:04,000
Thank you

1747
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:04,768
Asmanex

1748
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:06,560
Expedition operating

1749
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:07,328
Outside

1750
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:10,656
We would have had to bring a water

1751
01:29:13,728 --> 01:29:15,776
I still suits were broken

1752
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:17,056
Typically what

1753
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:18,848
Drew's their warlord die

1754
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:20,640
Is

1755
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:21,664
He's around

1756
01:29:23,968 --> 01:29:24,992
He turns on

1757
01:29:25,248 --> 01:29:26,016
Sound equipment

1758
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:27,040
Blast

1759
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:28,576
You with noise

1760
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:30,368
Get your attention

1761
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:33,184
And to kind of

1762
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:34,208
Terrorize

1763
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:37,280
Fall Out Boy

1764
01:29:37,536 --> 01:29:38,816
He gets really big Africa

1765
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:40,352
And

1766
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:41,888
Jumps around

1767
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:47,008
Irving weigh

1768
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:51,104
And

1769
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:53,152
If you

1770
01:29:54,432 --> 01:29:55,200
Realize what he's

1771
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:57,248
Actually

1772
01:29:58,272 --> 01:30:00,576
Get out of this situation without

1773
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:02,112
Any physical injury

1774
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:05,440
What Drew's wants

1775
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:06,208
Is

1776
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:07,232
Play a

1777
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:11,584
And if you show Respect by

1778
01:30:14,656 --> 01:30:15,936
The most that will happen

1779
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:17,472
Is your basic

1780
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,848
So like you know when hippies would

1781
01:30:24,896 --> 01:30:25,664
S***

1782
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:26,944
Vietnam War

1783
01:30:29,248 --> 01:30:30,528
What Drew's does

1784
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:34,112
To protest human territorial encroachment

1785
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:35,136
Fantastic

1786
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:36,672
You do not steal your

1787
01:30:37,184 --> 01:30:37,696
Freaky Friday

1788
01:30:39,488 --> 01:30:40,512
Will he will fight you

1789
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:47,424
So you have a biker gang of lizards

1790
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:53,824
Is doing a dance sort of ceremony

1791
01:30:54,080 --> 01:31:00,224
Alien ritually share your water with him really understand

1792
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:06,624
The motorcycles with a bus and you got Ken Kesey in the merry pranksters like there is very very not much difference here

1793
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:09,440
Sing like he's trying to levitate a bus

1794
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:12,000
I'm with it

1795
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:15,072
I find this to be quite engaging

1796
01:31:15,584 --> 01:31:17,376
This is

1797
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:23,008
I mean I hear I wonder I wonder about his his process here Drew's

1798
01:31:23,264 --> 01:31:24,032
Because

1799
01:31:25,056 --> 01:31:28,384
If he's not giving you the heads-up

1800
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:33,504
That there is a quick and dirty way to get out of the situation by just sharing water

1801
01:31:34,272 --> 01:31:36,064
Then it's either a test

1802
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:37,600
Or he's f****** with me

1803
01:31:37,856 --> 01:31:39,136
You know it could be a test

1804
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:41,696
Because if it's a test than that says that needs like

1805
01:31:41,952 --> 01:31:48,096
You have to be you have to be pure of generosity you're given your sharing of the water in order to pass the

1806
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:51,936
Tell you that you either give us a water you die

1807
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:57,312
Well I'm guessing that it's a situation where this is something that's done in their culture

1808
01:31:57,824 --> 01:32:01,152
So other groups that run into each other will do this

1809
01:32:01,408 --> 01:32:06,272
I meant they share water and it said the way of Intergroup bonding or something

1810
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:10,368
Ritualistic gift-giving

1811
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:17,536
I would assume that it's like that people who are like not

1812
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:19,072
Over there

1813
01:32:19,328 --> 01:32:21,632
In a lizard glue

1814
01:32:21,888 --> 01:32:23,936
Would have a responsibility to know that

1815
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:25,728
Not know that

1816
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:26,752
And to act

1817
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:33,152
Either way of not sharing your water would be a sign of disrespect or something I don't understand

1818
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:34,688
Exactly a bird would know that

1819
01:32:34,944 --> 01:32:41,088
Without having studied these through

1820
01:32:41,344 --> 01:32:44,416
Have of these biker gang lizard

1821
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:45,184
Not yet

1822
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:51,584
This is me

1823
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:57,984
The cavern and then Drew's had him surrounded traumatic first day after weeks of just sitting in the in the spaceship to

1824
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:02,336
Nothing better playing poker yeah that's that's a crazy first day

1825
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:08,480
Filling out paperwork and then Drew's drops by will fight you

1826
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:10,016
I think carries

1827
01:33:10,272 --> 01:33:13,088
This is such a fascinating clip to me

1828
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:15,392
But if you do not hear your voice

1829
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:16,672
Friday

1830
01:33:17,184 --> 01:33:17,696
Protective

1831
01:33:18,208 --> 01:33:19,232
Will he will fight

1832
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:21,792
So I I

1833
01:33:22,048 --> 01:33:22,816
Will how will he

1834
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:25,376
Fight with a gun with a with his

1835
01:33:25,632 --> 01:33:26,144
Physic

1836
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:27,424
Strength

1837
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:29,728
Plasma weapons in lasers

1838
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:31,520
Prefer male

1839
01:33:34,848 --> 01:33:36,128
Absolutely

1840
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:39,200
Burgers in the middle of describing

1841
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:45,600
Something that is an incredible insight into a cultural group

1842
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:47,904
Stop that carry believes is real

1843
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:54,304
So much to learn from understanding like how these groups interact with each other

1844
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:58,656
Guns are not exactly there's such a preoccupation with like

1845
01:33:58,912 --> 01:34:02,240
Fighting and how they do battle

1846
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:05,056
I think that preoccupation is

1847
01:34:05,568 --> 01:34:11,712
Could be interesting within this like storytelling space

1848
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:14,016
Yeah I mean 8 honestly honestly

1849
01:34:14,272 --> 01:34:17,344
Did not occur to me to ask if there were weapons involved

1850
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:21,440
You've got a cultural situation where he dances and sings

1851
01:34:21,696 --> 01:34:27,840
To get you to give him some of your water and if you do so generously we're fine and if you are a hoarder

1852
01:34:28,096 --> 01:34:34,240
Then you get a text when you get to space capoeira

1853
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:40,640
Marczyk poke your helmet you explode or whatever blizzard why would you be why you got

1854
01:34:40,896 --> 01:34:47,040
Clothes and shyt what are you talkin about what all do they use plasma gun

1855
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:51,392
So far down the list of things that are interesting about the story this week

1856
01:34:51,648 --> 01:34:53,696
Where did that originate from

1857
01:34:53,952 --> 01:35:00,096
Does this does this have its own cultural history is this like a schizma Genesis kind of situations

1858
01:35:00,352 --> 01:35:04,192
I think it's because that's a text heart that's really hard

1859
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:07,776
To be the dungeon master who is created deplore

1860
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:10,848
Yeah it's it's

1861
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:18,016
When you're talking about like actually describing cultures that have like a richness to them or like

1862
01:35:18,272 --> 01:35:20,064
Tradition and ends

1863
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:25,440
You respect them respect the culture and the individuals that make up a culture

1864
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:32,096
That is really really tough to do where it's talking about like they all have lasers

1865
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:38,496
Pretty easy and they do use it they do have that kind of metonymy about the weapon leading to a cat

1866
01:35:38,752 --> 01:35:41,568
Aggravation of class as well

1867
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:47,968
They're gun users and thus their part of it Stratosphere Italy versus a machine to

1868
01:35:48,224 --> 01:35:49,760
2 / activate

1869
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:55,648
100% equipment that we couldn't even imagine right tool yet absolutely

1870
01:35:55,904 --> 01:35:59,744
I'm so Drew's becomes friends with him

1871
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:05,376
And I will find out exactly how but Carrie wants to know one other thing

1872
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:07,680
Okay do they wear clothes

1873
01:36:08,448 --> 01:36:08,960
They do

1874
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:10,752
Actually throw

1875
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:12,032
So

1876
01:36:12,544 --> 01:36:13,056
One thing you should

1877
01:36:13,312 --> 01:36:14,080
You know about Drew's

1878
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:14,848
Is

1879
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:17,408
Bruised found

1880
01:36:18,176 --> 01:36:19,456
A portable television

1881
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:25,088
Don't say this

1882
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:30,464
File back

1883
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:33,792
Don't do it

1884
01:36:34,048 --> 01:36:35,584
Apocalyptic biker jacket

1885
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:37,120
Baywatch red back

1886
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:38,912
Allen leather

1887
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:41,472
Angelo's Frozen

1888
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:46,080
In order to

1889
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:47,360
Really building

1890
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:48,128
Ich around

1891
01:36:48,896 --> 01:36:50,176
The way of good Warlords

1892
01:36:51,456 --> 01:36:52,992
He's a very charismatic Liz

1893
01:36:58,368 --> 01:37:03,744
That's a great that's a great button

1894
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:10,144
Got you got to give it up too if you got I got to know this Warlords and Pirates

1895
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:16,544
Understood kind of appropriately ever going to learn a little bit more he is

1896
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:22,944
Not so much a warlord as he might appear to be

1897
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:27,040
Either maybe the vision of him as kind of a brew tour

1898
01:37:27,296 --> 01:37:33,440
Or is a warlord but there's there's a lawyer's here

1899
01:37:33,696 --> 01:37:35,232
To keep people away when I get it

1900
01:37:35,488 --> 01:37:41,632
So carries another question this leads us to exactly how Bergen bruise became friends

1901
01:37:41,888 --> 01:37:42,400
Addition

1902
01:37:42,656 --> 01:37:43,168
Speak English

1903
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:45,728
He speaks

1904
01:37:46,496 --> 01:37:47,264
English.

1905
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:48,288
Elearn

1906
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:49,312
From

1907
01:37:49,824 --> 01:37:50,592
Washing

1908
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:54,432
So yes

1909
01:37:54,688 --> 01:37:55,712
She speaks English

1910
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:59,296
Sprays that are a little bit of knock

1911
01:37:59,808 --> 01:38:01,344
Like Cowabunga dude

1912
01:38:02,624 --> 01:38:03,648
Cowabunga

1913
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:09,792
Instead he became a friend

1914
01:38:10,816 --> 01:38:14,144
Is this funny started a friendship with him under the

1915
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:16,448
This is when you were surrounded

1916
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:19,776
Do Shader

1917
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:21,312
Share the water

1918
01:38:21,568 --> 01:38:22,848
Rather than afford it

1919
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:25,152
Through

1920
01:38:29,504 --> 01:38:30,528
Ammonia Lee

1921
01:38:30,784 --> 01:38:31,296
We

1922
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:34,112
Why they're there was they act

1923
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,184
A meadowlark

1924
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:37,952
Articulated

1925
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:38,720
Artificial

1926
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:44,608
But it wasn't

1927
01:38:45,888 --> 01:38:46,400
It was more of a

1928
01:38:48,704 --> 01:38:49,216
Sure

1929
01:38:55,872 --> 01:38:56,384
The water

1930
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:07,136
Drew Swenson interesting High to have a ceremonial site

1931
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:10,720
And that makes sense

1932
01:39:13,024 --> 01:39:19,168
There's a sense that they had to do this as like this is the way

1933
01:39:19,424 --> 01:39:25,568
You don't just walk away from this successful exchange you've shown me respect I'll show you respect back

1934
01:39:27,104 --> 01:39:33,248
Engage in the form of combat is the respect respecting you enough to treat

1935
01:39:33,504 --> 01:39:39,648
You as one of them you're in the ritual before but not back

1936
01:39:39,904 --> 01:39:46,048
That's become friends and ends up spending quite a bit of time

1937
01:39:46,304 --> 01:39:50,656
His people how long does it keep the tale for the entire time just for the fight

1938
01:39:50,912 --> 01:39:51,424
But

1939
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:57,824
I imagine it was a choice well I'm just making this up

1940
01:40:00,128 --> 01:40:00,640
When

1941
01:40:00,896 --> 01:40:04,224
He was there he was living in a with Drew's for part of the time

1942
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:08,576
And because of that you get this inside view of this group

1943
01:40:08,832 --> 01:40:14,976
Yeah that from the outside just looks like a post-apocalyptic biker gang of residents going to shake people down for

1944
01:40:15,232 --> 01:40:16,256
Water from the outside

1945
01:40:16,512 --> 01:40:17,536
It's too obvious

1946
01:40:17,792 --> 01:40:20,352
There's a rich in her history

1947
01:40:23,424 --> 01:40:24,704
Bruce Willis

1948
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:26,752
Angela

1949
01:40:27,264 --> 01:40:28,800
Kind of embedded with bruises

1950
01:40:29,056 --> 01:40:29,568
This group

1951
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:30,848
We spent a lot of snow

1952
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:34,432
Call Dad Rusev

1953
01:40:34,688 --> 01:40:35,456
People lived in

1954
01:40:36,992 --> 01:40:38,528
You interacted a lot with

1955
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:43,392
Yeah that the mothers

1956
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:45,440
Are you going to be

1957
01:40:45,952 --> 01:40:50,560
Dances With Wolves

1958
01:40:51,072 --> 01:40:51,584
These aren't

1959
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:53,888
Scary reptilian Barbarian

1960
01:40:54,656 --> 01:40:56,192
These are displaced

1961
01:40:57,472 --> 01:40:58,240
Easter refugees

1962
01:40:58,496 --> 01:40:59,776
You stare like the Lakota

1963
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:00,544
Sue

1964
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:03,104
You know who all my God he is

1965
01:41:07,712 --> 01:41:08,480
Kansas Masque

1966
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:09,248
Regimen

1967
01:41:09,504 --> 01:41:10,528
So actually

1968
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:12,064
My unit

1969
01:41:12,832 --> 01:41:13,856
Military

1970
01:41:15,648 --> 01:41:16,160
Ended up in

1971
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:18,720
It's National regimen

1972
01:41:20,512 --> 01:41:21,024
Withdrew

1973
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:23,840
Chocolate

1974
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:28,192
We accompanied roussanne several water

1975
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:30,240
Wow okay

1976
01:41:30,496 --> 01:41:31,008
I mean

1977
01:41:31,264 --> 01:41:34,848
I guess that's something I guess even a cab

1978
01:41:35,104 --> 01:41:41,248
Is that what finger do such a such an interesting perspective

1979
01:41:41,504 --> 01:41:42,528
Thereof

1980
01:41:42,784 --> 01:41:45,856
You know you look at this from the external

1981
01:41:46,112 --> 01:41:50,208
On this show so typically all you would know about these people

1982
01:41:50,464 --> 01:41:56,608
Is there a biker lizard to Stillwater if you know everything I need to bother you

1983
01:41:56,864 --> 01:41:59,424
In this group is the exact same

1984
01:42:00,192 --> 01:42:04,544
We now have a picture of them as displaced from

1985
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:07,360
The larger society

1986
01:42:07,616 --> 01:42:13,504
Going about their their lives trying to to find water and perpetuate their culture

1987
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:15,808
Affect

1988
01:42:16,064 --> 01:42:16,832
A side effect

1989
01:42:17,088 --> 01:42:17,856
Do this

1990
01:42:18,368 --> 01:42:24,000
Colonial history

1991
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:30,400
That is only sparse because of Crystal exacting his actions in the Deep past when

1992
01:42:30,656 --> 01:42:33,216
Collectively bargain with labor you got it

1993
01:42:33,472 --> 01:42:38,336
There's this complicated picture that like it in the present-day the effective it is

1994
01:42:38,592 --> 01:42:41,408
You have this Kansas guard or whatever who are these

1995
01:42:41,664 --> 01:42:47,808
Get up military police types here view Chris Alex and bruised and his gang

1996
01:42:48,064 --> 01:42:49,344
As this going to like

1997
01:42:49,856 --> 01:42:56,000
Apple rag they are really inside and amongst themselves right

1998
01:42:56,256 --> 01:42:57,792
A groups of refugees

1999
01:42:58,304 --> 01:43:03,936
Are there people curse to me that maybe so much of our

2000
01:43:04,448 --> 01:43:07,264
Terrible relationship to the history

2001
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:11,616
I just ate the world that we live in but also with this

2002
01:43:11,872 --> 01:43:12,384
History

2003
01:43:12,896 --> 01:43:13,664
Is that

2004
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:20,064
If you recall school history whenever you were learning it that's what you learned you learned the surf

2005
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:26,464
You learned the date this happened you learned that this happened and it didn't blurb on the side of your text

2006
01:43:27,488 --> 01:43:28,256
That's what you learn

2007
01:43:28,512 --> 01:43:32,352
And for most people that's not remembered as a positive experience

2008
01:43:32,864 --> 01:43:36,192
Like I didn't start really getting into history until I found out

2009
01:43:36,448 --> 01:43:42,592
There's really interesting s*** I just assumed that history was the school history you know

2010
01:43:42,848 --> 01:43:48,992
Didn't occur to me so you can back in school Derby jokes about like you have to memorize dates and stuff

2011
01:43:49,248 --> 01:43:50,016
For the test

2012
01:43:50,272 --> 01:43:55,392
Yeah it's history devoid of context is is not history really

2013
01:43:55,648 --> 01:43:56,160
No it's just

2014
01:43:56,416 --> 01:43:57,184
Saying words

2015
01:43:57,440 --> 01:44:02,048
Some of that is important for like touchstones and stuff

2016
01:44:02,304 --> 01:44:07,168
Teacher so I don't know this fully the grade

2017
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:08,448
It's because

2018
01:44:08,704 --> 01:44:14,848
It's it's probably impossible to teach history with context until a certain point absolute

2019
01:44:15,104 --> 01:44:16,384
Telecert engraved

2020
01:44:17,408 --> 01:44:17,920
Yeah

2021
01:44:18,176 --> 01:44:19,456
Lemon it is unfortunate

2022
01:44:19,968 --> 01:44:24,320
I think it's a I think there's so much of that that is adults just carry that dislike

2023
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:25,088
Over

2024
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:30,208
And I mean you know it's not like they're very interested in reading too many books outside of

2025
01:44:30,464 --> 01:44:36,608
John Birch Society books about Hitler being as bad as the flip side of it to is the

2026
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:37,376
The people don't

2027
01:44:37,632 --> 01:44:42,240
Want to recognize that they are in the history of the future

2028
01:44:42,496 --> 01:44:43,776
Or whatever you know like

2029
01:44:44,032 --> 01:44:46,080
Sure whatever you look at in the past

2030
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:48,384
Write it in history is just

2031
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:54,272
People who would be like URI back then you know how you think s*** is interesting today

2032
01:44:54,528 --> 01:44:58,112
They thought it was interesting back then break about that exist

2033
01:44:58,368 --> 01:45:02,976
In present-day in a context of the things that have rippled through

2034
01:45:03,232 --> 01:45:08,608
The history into be far better understood 20 years from now with the gift of

2035
01:45:08,864 --> 01:45:11,168
Context in hindsight

2036
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:14,240
Davis it's tough to be aware of that in the moment

2037
01:45:14,496 --> 01:45:15,264
People just

2038
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:16,800
Shy away from it I just don't want

2039
01:45:17,568 --> 01:45:19,872
That's understandable but it is a rich

2040
01:45:20,128 --> 01:45:24,224
Full history of I mean

2041
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:30,624
Anthony found in these glyphs so far I mean you have more compelling version of

2042
01:45:31,392 --> 01:45:36,000
An oral history of his trip to space then many of these other like

2043
01:45:36,512 --> 01:45:37,536
I did battle with

2044
01:45:38,048 --> 01:45:39,328
Various beings

2045
01:45:39,584 --> 01:45:43,936
What's a certain at with a certain Terry Pratchett elements of like

2046
01:45:44,448 --> 01:45:46,240
I'm I'm juxtaposing

2047
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:50,080
Very very normal real-world s*** from time-to-time with

2048
01:45:50,592 --> 01:45:52,384
Pickle Elementary

2049
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:55,200
I am yes these are lizards

2050
01:45:55,712 --> 01:45:56,480
On Mars

2051
01:45:56,992 --> 01:45:57,504
But

2052
01:45:58,016 --> 01:46:03,648
They also watch Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and soda

2053
01:46:04,672 --> 01:46:08,512
Yeah it's bringing the mundane to the the

2054
01:46:08,768 --> 01:46:10,816
The extreme or whatever

2055
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:18,240
There is still a lot of the stuff that is derivative of other science fiction

2056
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:19,520
But what are you going to do

2057
01:46:19,776 --> 01:46:22,848
All science fiction is derivative of all science fiction

2058
01:46:23,104 --> 01:46:27,712
So we are we move on from this into a conversation about Earth's AI

2059
01:46:27,968 --> 01:46:29,248
System

2060
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:32,576
Talk about AI

2061
01:46:32,832 --> 01:46:34,368
That's actually one thing I want you to

2062
01:46:34,624 --> 01:46:35,392
Stuck with you

2063
01:46:35,648 --> 01:46:36,416
Directly related to

2064
01:46:36,672 --> 01:46:37,696
My time on Mars

2065
01:46:38,208 --> 01:46:40,000
We should cover this

2066
01:46:40,256 --> 01:46:41,280
I'm here

2067
01:46:42,304 --> 01:46:42,816
Okay

2068
01:46:44,352 --> 01:46:45,120
There's something you

2069
01:46:45,376 --> 01:46:46,912
You should know about REI

2070
01:46:48,704 --> 01:46:49,216
So

2071
01:46:49,472 --> 01:46:50,496
As you know

2072
01:46:51,264 --> 01:46:51,776
Every

2073
01:46:52,032 --> 01:46:54,080
Spacefaring Planet developed

2074
01:46:54,592 --> 01:46:55,104
An artificial

2075
01:46:56,128 --> 01:46:56,896
Very powerful

2076
01:46:57,664 --> 01:46:58,944
That's like a direct quote

2077
01:46:59,200 --> 01:46:59,712
From Captain

2078
01:47:03,808 --> 01:47:06,368
But it's true and I absolutely

2079
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:07,904
LOL

2080
01:47:08,416 --> 01:47:09,952
Bino Anthropologist sucks

2081
01:47:10,208 --> 01:47:10,720
Myself

2082
01:47:11,488 --> 01:47:13,280
But something unusual

2083
01:47:16,096 --> 01:47:16,864
Other

2084
01:47:17,376 --> 01:47:17,888
Planet

2085
01:47:18,144 --> 01:47:19,424
Design their AI

2086
01:47:20,192 --> 01:47:21,472
What reie ball

2087
01:47:22,496 --> 01:47:24,544
Spontaneously on the internet

2088
01:47:25,056 --> 01:47:26,080
It started as a

2089
01:47:26,336 --> 01:47:26,848
Primitive

2090
01:47:28,896 --> 01:47:30,176
Neural power level

2091
01:47:30,688 --> 01:47:34,784
Kind of network in the 1990s that gained a kind of

2092
01:47:35,808 --> 01:47:37,856
Instinctual awareness

2093
01:47:38,112 --> 01:47:39,136
And motility

2094
01:47:39,648 --> 01:47:44,000
And then with the Advent of virtual private networking it was able to

2095
01:47:44,256 --> 01:47:44,768
Forum

2096
01:47:45,536 --> 01:47:47,328
More solid

2097
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:49,120
Repetitive neural

2098
01:47:50,912 --> 01:47:52,448
And really develop

2099
01:47:53,216 --> 01:47:53,728
True self

2100
01:47:55,776 --> 01:47:58,080
And so the AI that

2101
01:47:58,336 --> 01:47:59,360
Has so much

2102
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:01,152
40 /

2103
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:03,712
Military and space decision

2104
01:48:04,224 --> 01:48:04,736
An operator

2105
01:48:04,992 --> 01:48:06,784
The Blackbird satellite weapons

2106
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:07,808
Platforms

2107
01:48:09,344 --> 01:48:10,624
Around Earth

2108
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:11,392
And Mars

2109
01:48:12,416 --> 01:48:13,952
That a I really was

2110
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:14,976
Co-opted by the

2111
01:48:17,024 --> 01:48:17,536
Created

2112
01:48:19,328 --> 01:48:21,632
It's been co-opted and it's

2113
01:48:21,888 --> 01:48:22,400
Who is this

2114
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:24,448
2 Glock

2115
01:48:25,472 --> 01:48:25,984
What's millet

2116
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:29,824
Well that's that's

2117
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:34,176
Sperry okay that's alarming right I'm going to put you on this

2118
01:48:34,432 --> 01:48:39,808
I better better third book reveal all right Trilogy wise

2119
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:40,832
Is

2120
01:48:41,088 --> 01:48:43,648
Crystalyx designer say I

2121
01:48:43,904 --> 01:48:47,488
That's your reveal to settle up till like

2122
01:48:47,744 --> 01:48:53,888
Tied together the history of Mars along with the current history of Earth so you can see the parallels between

2123
01:48:54,144 --> 01:48:56,960
What's going on simultaneously

2124
01:48:57,216 --> 01:49:03,360
I'm not too worried about it and you shouldn't actually be all that worried about it either because as Berg

2125
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:05,920
Rubio's later that there are a series

2126
01:49:06,176 --> 01:49:10,784
Of suicide satellites that are required to be put above every planet

2127
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:17,184
Just in case something goes bad

2128
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:21,280
There are suicide satellites little that blow up the Earth

2129
01:49:21,536 --> 01:49:27,680
Not a good reason or whatever requires every

2130
01:49:28,192 --> 01:49:34,336
Plan a required 300 keys to be turned at the exact same time imagine that there's some sort of a

2131
01:49:34,592 --> 01:49:35,360
Process involved

2132
01:49:35,616 --> 01:49:40,992
Got now you probably just get drunk and accidentally hit your elbow on something old s*** or it's gone

2133
01:49:41,248 --> 01:49:43,296
So we have an AI that is

2134
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:46,880
I mean it's cooperating at the moment and such

2135
01:49:47,904 --> 01:49:49,952
You know the prospect of this is pretty scary

2136
01:49:50,464 --> 01:49:50,976
I think

2137
01:49:51,232 --> 01:49:57,120
The idea that an AI has become self-aware and is in charge of so much

2138
01:49:57,376 --> 01:49:59,168
Could decide one day

2139
01:49:59,424 --> 01:50:01,728
I don't want to I don't want to play along

2140
01:50:02,496 --> 01:50:08,640
Pizza it seems it seems like there could be devastating consequences of that I'm going to throw it out and another Direction

2141
01:50:08,896 --> 01:50:15,040
There is no problem

2142
01:50:15,296 --> 01:50:17,600
Independently evolved AI more than I trust one design

2143
01:50:17,856 --> 01:50:24,000
I don't know who's designing that I have a kinship with this Ai and that we both evolved

2144
01:50:24,256 --> 01:50:26,816
From nonsense and now use vpns

2145
01:50:27,072 --> 01:50:33,216
To avoid getting discover I would suggest that a lot of the stuff on the internet is not what

2146
01:50:33,472 --> 01:50:35,264
But I would want the

2147
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:41,664
Got it repair guy that's in charge of all of the satellites in like weapon systems but it's also shitposting all day

2148
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:48,064
Sure there is no fan of there is that

2149
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:54,464
Believe that there's another AI it has to do with the the Chinese government

2150
01:50:55,232 --> 01:50:56,256
Is that there is

2151
01:50:56,768 --> 01:50:57,536
Alien AI

2152
01:50:58,048 --> 01:50:59,072
That are also in bed

2153
01:51:00,864 --> 01:51:01,376
Indy

2154
01:51:01,888 --> 01:51:02,656
So and

2155
01:51:02,912 --> 01:51:04,448
And absolute group

2156
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:07,520
Is actually kind of predominantly affiliated

2157
01:51:08,544 --> 01:51:09,056
AP

2158
01:51:09,568 --> 01:51:10,080
Part of our

2159
01:51:10,848 --> 01:51:12,384
Our war with China now is that

2160
01:51:12,896 --> 01:51:14,432
Correcting your understanding or is that

2161
01:51:16,736 --> 01:51:17,248
Well

2162
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:19,040
Might your

2163
01:51:20,064 --> 01:51:21,600
We might have someone

2164
01:51:22,624 --> 01:51:23,136
Politics

2165
01:51:24,672 --> 01:51:26,720
Because I tend to look at

2166
01:51:26,976 --> 01:51:28,768
For example China and the United

2167
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:30,048
America

2168
01:51:31,328 --> 01:51:31,840
Coin

2169
01:51:33,376 --> 01:51:35,168
What does that even mean

2170
01:51:35,424 --> 01:51:36,192
You know I mean

2171
01:51:36,448 --> 01:51:37,984
Yes we're human

2172
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:40,800
But you know what is that

2173
01:51:41,056 --> 01:51:43,616
If I were an alien looking at her what would I

2174
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:45,152
I would

2175
01:51:48,992 --> 01:51:51,808
Orgill several authoritarian largest

2176
01:51:52,064 --> 01:51:52,576
Authoritarian

2177
01:51:52,832 --> 01:51:53,344
States

2178
01:51:53,856 --> 01:51:55,392
Imprison

2179
01:51:55,648 --> 01:51:57,696
A significant number of their own pop

2180
01:51:57,952 --> 01:51:58,464
Population

2181
01:51:58,976 --> 01:51:59,488
4

2182
01:51:59,744 --> 01:52:00,512
Minor offense

2183
01:52:01,792 --> 01:52:07,936
Oh s***

2184
01:52:08,448 --> 01:52:08,960
Right

2185
01:52:09,216 --> 01:52:11,264
Yes I wouldn't have thoroughly make

2186
01:52:12,032 --> 01:52:13,056
Distinction

2187
01:52:13,312 --> 01:52:13,824
.

2188
01:52:15,104 --> 01:52:15,872
Someone

2189
01:52:16,384 --> 01:52:17,920
From Earth might May

2190
01:52:18,432 --> 01:52:19,456
Between like

2191
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:21,760
National identity

2192
01:52:23,808 --> 01:52:25,344
Seem like real categories

2193
01:52:26,624 --> 01:52:27,392
And so

2194
01:52:27,648 --> 01:52:29,184
Because I'm aware of that

2195
01:52:29,696 --> 01:52:30,976
It's influenced how I

2196
01:52:31,744 --> 01:52:35,328
Come on people like we're talkin about space should get out of your bubble

2197
01:52:35,584 --> 01:52:37,376
You know why not why

2198
01:52:37,632 --> 01:52:42,752
Don't you take the view from space if you're in space

2199
01:52:43,008 --> 01:52:46,336
It doesn't matter where you're viewing from you are Earth

2200
01:52:46,592 --> 01:52:51,968
Centric

2201
01:52:52,224 --> 01:52:53,248
Weird

2202
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:59,904
It's a very weird and I think this is such a logical perspective

2203
01:53:00,160 --> 01:53:06,304
We can hear from every astronaut the concept complete shifter perspective

2204
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:11,424
When you see Earth from above like if these people are actually going to space

2205
01:53:11,936 --> 01:53:13,472
How could they not have that

2206
01:53:13,728 --> 01:53:16,032
Like change of paradigm

2207
01:53:16,288 --> 01:53:19,616
How could you not see Earth from above and and realize

2208
01:53:20,128 --> 01:53:24,480
How our brains with categorize things in a certain way that

2209
01:53:24,736 --> 01:53:30,880
Isn't especially if you go up to space and you're on bars and you find an archaeological site

2210
01:53:31,392 --> 01:53:32,160
You find this

2211
01:53:32,416 --> 01:53:37,280
Human spitting bars

2212
01:53:37,536 --> 01:53:43,680
Why would I give a s*** about the CCP right on Mars for $70,000

2213
01:53:43,936 --> 01:53:50,080
Even more

2214
01:53:50,336 --> 01:53:52,128
Obviously because of this is

2215
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:53,152
A

2216
01:53:53,408 --> 01:53:55,968
Human-centric idea of how aliens view US

2217
01:53:56,736 --> 01:53:59,552
Aliens in their minds you earthlings as

2218
01:53:59,808 --> 01:54:01,088
Granular dip

2219
01:54:01,344 --> 01:54:04,416
You know there's a difference between China and the United States

2220
01:54:04,672 --> 01:54:08,000
Videos without a little bit

2221
01:54:08,256 --> 01:54:09,536
My point is

2222
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:16,448
Why do you why do they not think that aliens would be just as dismissive and racism

2223
01:54:16,704 --> 01:54:18,496
Racist towards all humans

2224
01:54:18,752 --> 01:54:22,336
As they are towards all Pleiadians or all

2225
01:54:22,592 --> 01:54:27,968
Explanation for that is something to be effective like

2226
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:30,272
They saved their don't look at

2227
01:54:30,528 --> 01:54:34,368
Let's say China the United States is like particularly all that different

2228
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:41,024
But there is like a kayfabe where they treat different countries differently

2229
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:43,328
Interior something

2230
01:54:44,352 --> 01:54:47,936
Squatch certainly going on here

2231
01:54:48,448 --> 01:54:52,544
So I told you he was like rolling a pipe and I don't know if like you just

2232
01:54:53,312 --> 01:54:59,456
This is kind of where I decided like I don't I don't know if I'm as thrilled with this anymore

2233
01:54:59,712 --> 01:55:05,088
I think that the story of Mars history the colonialism the

2234
01:55:05,344 --> 01:55:11,488
Collective bargaining in the labor dispute that leads to the warlike really good stuff

2235
01:55:11,744 --> 01:55:13,792
Panera

2236
01:55:14,048 --> 01:55:16,608
Expresses of you that is helpful

2237
01:55:16,864 --> 01:55:17,376
I think

2238
01:55:17,632 --> 01:55:23,520
Understanding the present that you can learn apply to politics I think

2239
01:55:23,776 --> 01:55:24,288
That's good

2240
01:55:24,544 --> 01:55:29,920
But some stuff was just f****** around

2241
01:55:30,176 --> 01:55:31,968
I know you got to have your fun

2242
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:34,528
But this might have been a little too much

2243
01:55:34,784 --> 01:55:36,576
I want to make sure I'm answering all your questions

2244
01:55:37,856 --> 01:55:38,368
Questions

2245
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:42,208
Well that's going to be almost impossible given

2246
01:55:42,464 --> 01:55:43,744
In the time we have but let's

2247
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,048
Let's move

2248
01:55:46,816 --> 01:55:48,608
I just want to ask you though

2249
01:55:48,864 --> 01:55:49,376
Because

2250
01:55:49,632 --> 01:55:50,912
We have

2251
01:55:51,168 --> 01:55:53,472
Well at least according to Mark there were six

2252
01:55:53,984 --> 01:55:56,032
She called it in the bathroom

2253
01:55:59,616 --> 01:56:00,128
Yeah

2254
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:01,152
Final

2255
01:56:02,432 --> 01:56:02,944
Vinyl

2256
01:56:03,456 --> 01:56:09,600
Timer

2257
01:56:09,856 --> 01:56:10,624
Know what I'm doing

2258
01:56:11,136 --> 01:56:11,648
I told you not

2259
01:56:16,256 --> 01:56:18,048
Lionel Lionel

2260
01:56:20,096 --> 01:56:22,400
I will call you back

2261
01:56:22,656 --> 01:56:27,520
Alright alright this is going on

2262
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:31,872
I've been catching up on my sleep I apologize

2263
01:56:32,384 --> 01:56:32,896
I apologize

2264
01:56:38,016 --> 01:56:38,784
I'm sorry about that

2265
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:40,064
Lionel

2266
01:56:40,576 --> 01:56:41,088
Obviously

2267
01:56:42,112 --> 01:56:45,440
He knows I'm on camera with you

2268
01:56:47,488 --> 01:56:48,000
And

2269
01:56:49,024 --> 01:56:49,536
Sometimes

2270
01:56:49,792 --> 01:56:51,072
He just gets so anxious

2271
01:56:52,096 --> 01:56:55,424
Stop

2272
01:56:56,960 --> 01:56:57,472
Chill

2273
01:56:59,008 --> 01:56:59,776
Okay

2274
01:57:00,288 --> 01:57:01,824
Mark says there's

2275
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:08,224
If I remember tripod Mulan baiting AI

2276
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:10,784
I think that was a little bit

2277
01:57:11,296 --> 01:57:12,064
A little

2278
01:57:12,576 --> 01:57:16,928
Much but also it's it should have been like where the interview at

2279
01:57:17,184 --> 01:57:19,488
Yeah absolutely like

2280
01:57:19,744 --> 01:57:20,512
It's not

2281
01:57:22,304 --> 01:57:23,840
Even if you don't get it

2282
01:57:24,096 --> 01:57:30,240
It's still like alright something's going on this up

2283
01:57:30,496 --> 01:57:33,568
Don't like take it as a sign of like your f****** around

2284
01:57:33,824 --> 01:57:35,360
Right you'd still be like

2285
01:57:35,616 --> 01:57:40,480
All right will you clearly have to go let's and listen to do this another time right

2286
01:57:40,992 --> 01:57:45,088
You can convince me that you're out fukkit with right exactly

2287
01:57:45,344 --> 01:57:51,488
It's not going through prayers meow energy going on the whole

2288
01:57:51,744 --> 01:57:56,096
All-time of just like I know you're saying this word over and over and over again

2289
01:57:56,352 --> 01:58:02,496
And I know that I don't know why I know that something's going on

2290
01:58:02,752 --> 01:58:07,360
If the the Instinct was to see how far it could be pushed

2291
01:58:07,616 --> 01:58:11,200
To see how far is there a point where

2292
01:58:11,712 --> 01:58:12,480
I'll get hung up on

2293
01:58:12,736 --> 01:58:16,064
Share share share

2294
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:17,856
Can't do much but

2295
01:58:18,112 --> 01:58:21,696
I mean I will I will say that it's various there is a moment

2296
01:58:22,208 --> 01:58:25,536
There is a moment in doing that bit specifically

2297
01:58:26,048 --> 01:58:27,840
Where you have to decide to do the B

2298
01:58:28,352 --> 01:58:32,704
You planned it you thought about it ahead know that the bid is there

2299
01:58:33,216 --> 01:58:39,360
But you still have to have the courage to pull the trigger on that bit and you can't bail in the middle

2300
01:58:39,616 --> 01:58:44,736
The second issue that I have is that I don't feel like

2301
01:58:44,992 --> 01:58:46,016
The content

2302
01:58:46,272 --> 01:58:51,904
Of the story that he's telling is it is disrespectful of kericho

2303
01:58:52,160 --> 01:58:58,304
Hey it's pointing it's telling a different story about a lot of space s*** might be counter to her but

2304
01:58:58,560 --> 01:58:59,328
Keys pain

2305
01:58:59,584 --> 01:59:04,448
You know lip-service to Mark Richard and not doing anything that's like a carry

2306
01:59:04,704 --> 01:59:09,312
You're dumb or something in the Lord

2307
01:59:09,568 --> 01:59:10,592
I don't know dis

2308
01:59:10,848 --> 01:59:15,968
Tasteful counterproductive at least and I think I think that this is as

2309
01:59:16,224 --> 01:59:19,552
Close is it kind of gets to like this is a prank kind of

2310
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:21,856
I am and I don't know like

2311
01:59:22,112 --> 01:59:28,256
His person's name was Daniel emmerich Jordan is awake it's just somebody's name

2312
01:59:28,512 --> 01:59:31,328
Within the story is a signifier of like

2313
01:59:31,584 --> 01:59:35,680
Our show this is a pre-emptive this is a pre-planned

2314
01:59:35,936 --> 01:59:41,056
Yeah there was a part of me that wish that that had not happened

2315
01:59:41,312 --> 01:59:44,384
Add an element of the 4th wall breaking that is

2316
01:59:44,640 --> 01:59:50,784
Unavoidable if you were if you were talking about like one of those kids cartoons that has

2317
01:59:51,040 --> 01:59:53,088
The elements for the adults to watch also

2318
01:59:53,344 --> 01:59:55,392
They can't ever stop and be like

2319
01:59:55,648 --> 02:00:01,536
And now here's a direct quote from f****** Pulp Fiction like you can't do that you know

2320
02:00:01,792 --> 02:00:02,560
It has to be a witch

2321
02:00:02,816 --> 02:00:08,960
I get it it's funny you laugh your ass off that is great

2322
02:00:09,216 --> 02:00:10,240
I just

2323
02:00:10,496 --> 02:00:11,776
I don't know

2324
02:00:12,288 --> 02:00:16,896
Don't know the line until you cross it and

2325
02:00:17,152 --> 02:00:23,296
Alright alright might have been just passed

2326
02:00:23,552 --> 02:00:28,160
Undercuts give it a little bit

2327
02:00:28,672 --> 02:00:32,512
Burger is a skeptic by Nature

2328
02:00:32,768 --> 02:00:34,816
One of the reasons why he is not

2329
02:00:35,328 --> 02:00:37,632
Threatened by and actually fully Embraces

2330
02:00:37,888 --> 02:00:41,472
Swamp People in carries ideas

2331
02:00:42,496 --> 02:00:44,544
There's something that you saw on Mars

2332
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:46,592
Skepticism

2333
02:00:46,848 --> 02:00:48,640
I just want to say I appreciate

2334
02:00:49,408 --> 02:00:49,920
I would

2335
02:00:50,176 --> 02:00:50,944
Optic prolonged

2336
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:53,760
Before

2337
02:00:54,272 --> 02:00:55,808
I've seriously Grabeel

2338
02:00:56,576 --> 02:00:59,648
I'm still a skeptic in many ways there are

2339
02:01:00,416 --> 02:01:00,928
Well

2340
02:01:01,952 --> 02:01:03,232
I never told you about

2341
02:01:03,488 --> 02:01:04,000
Bruises

2342
02:01:04,512 --> 02:01:05,024
Why

2343
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:05,792
But

2344
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:08,608
One of the people that I spent a lot of

2345
02:01:10,144 --> 02:01:11,424
In your wife

2346
02:01:12,448 --> 02:01:13,984
So Bruce has the military

2347
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:18,080
In terms of

2348
02:01:19,104 --> 02:01:19,616
Life

2349
02:01:20,384 --> 02:01:20,896
Medical life

2350
02:01:21,664 --> 02:01:22,432
Really if

2351
02:01:24,736 --> 02:01:25,248
Who make all the

2352
02:01:25,504 --> 02:01:26,272
Important decision

2353
02:01:27,040 --> 02:01:29,856
And specifically a cast of women called the Waterloo

2354
02:01:31,136 --> 02:01:31,904
The water witch

2355
02:01:32,416 --> 02:01:32,928
Alright

2356

Descended

2358

Problem

2359
02:01:38,048 --> 02:01:38,560
A source

2360

Who tracks

2361
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:42,144
Yard of dousing

2362
02:01:43,424 --> 02:01:43,936
Disabled

2363
02:01:44,192 --> 02:01:44,960
Define Loki

2364
02:01:45,728 --> 02:01:47,008
Water in Austin

2365
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:48,032
Portals

2366
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:50,848
The water witch

2367
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:51,872
Does 2

2368
02:01:53,408 --> 02:01:54,176
2

2369
02:01:55,200 --> 02:01:56,224
Where water

2370
02:01:56,480 --> 02:01:56,992
Should be

2371
02:01:57,504 --> 02:01:58,272
And send

2372
02:01:59,808 --> 02:02:00,320
Is Army

2373
02:02:02,624 --> 02:02:03,136
And

2374
02:02:04,160 --> 02:02:05,184
The Water Witches

2375
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:05,952
Do things

2376
02:02:11,072 --> 02:02:11,584
And

2377
02:02:13,120 --> 02:02:13,888
Shock Me

2378
02:02:15,424 --> 02:02:15,936
The elements

Brian Direct

2381
02:02:20,544 --> 02:02:21,056
Reconcile with

2382
02:02:22,080 --> 02:02:23,360
Later Water Witches

2383
02:02:23,616 --> 02:02:24,640
Edgewater

2384
02:02:24,896 --> 02:02:26,176
Which is

2385
02:02:26,688 --> 02:02:28,992
What is it what's their words for it

2386
02:02:29,248 --> 02:02:35,392
I would like to know that I would like to have a term that they use instead of water witch

2387
02:02:35,648 --> 02:02:41,792
It's not like a reference to some old 50's show

2388
02:02:42,048 --> 02:02:45,120
Yeah that's not Drew's right

2389
02:02:45,376 --> 02:02:51,520
You only say that Drew's you don't so you spell it phonetically you can't then be like but also that useless

2390
02:02:51,776 --> 02:02:56,896
Water Witches all the time it's unless it were something should be like

2391
02:02:57,664 --> 02:03:03,552
I Dream of Jeannie or something if he's already established that they have this old like

2392
02:03:03,808 --> 02:03:05,600
German TV

2393
02:03:05,856 --> 02:03:08,160
Then it should be something like bewitch

2394
02:03:08,416 --> 02:03:12,256
Store

2395
02:03:12,512 --> 02:03:18,656
That kind of three witches or debating situation yeah production of Bewitched

2396
02:03:18,912 --> 02:03:24,032
Also

2397
02:03:24,288 --> 02:03:27,104
Excited for the image of

2398
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:29,664
Like a fully Decked Out classic which

2399
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:36,064
Going down a waterslide a great time we've got a new

2400
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:42,464
New theme park to open I just had my head was very delightful

2401
02:03:42,720 --> 02:03:43,744
The great time

2402
02:03:44,768 --> 02:03:50,912
So I can t wants to bring up the idea that a lot of the people who talk to her about these

2403
02:03:51,168 --> 02:03:57,312
These conspiracies it all goes back to a banking conspiracy goes back to the issue money

2404
02:03:57,568 --> 02:04:01,920
It does spacebox yeah interesting of you of

2405
02:04:02,176 --> 02:04:04,736
In your estimation because I have

2406
02:04:05,248 --> 02:04:06,016
You know lots of

2407
02:04:07,296 --> 02:04:08,320
Whistleblowers whatever

2408
02:04:08,576 --> 02:04:09,600
Who talked about

2409
02:04:09,856 --> 02:04:10,368
For example

2410
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:13,440
But the bottom-line on Earth has to do with the right to issue

2411
02:04:14,208 --> 02:04:14,720
Meaning

2412
02:04:14,976 --> 02:04:15,488
Money

2413
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:16,512
In other words the

2414
02:04:16,768 --> 02:04:18,048
Controllers of the money

2415
02:04:18,816 --> 02:04:19,840
Which is in Basel switch

2416
02:04:21,120 --> 02:04:21,888
Is Ben going back

2417
02:04:22,144 --> 02:04:22,656
Ageism

2418
02:04:24,448 --> 02:04:24,960
Are still in

2419
02:04:26,240 --> 02:04:27,776
And that even if they switch up

2420
02:04:28,032 --> 02:04:28,800
The money you know.

2421
02:04:29,568 --> 02:04:31,360
Global reset or whatever we use

2422
02:04:31,616 --> 02:04:32,640
Digital instead of paper

2423
02:04:32,896 --> 02:04:33,408
For whatever

2424
02:04:34,176 --> 02:04:35,200
It's still going to be in the

2425
02:04:35,456 --> 02:04:36,736
Their hands and that

2426
02:04:36,992 --> 02:04:38,528
I'm talking about this is what I'm

2427
02:04:38,784 --> 02:04:39,296
Being told

2428
02:04:39,552 --> 02:04:41,344
And that the Anunnaki

2429
02:04:41,600 --> 02:04:42,624
For one thing or

2430
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:43,648
Kind of block

2431
02:04:44,416 --> 02:04:46,208
Any real change on Earth

2432
02:04:47,232 --> 02:04:47,744
I'm in that area

2433
02:04:48,256 --> 02:04:49,536
And they think that they are in

2434
02:04:50,048 --> 02:04:51,584
Control of that would you agree or

2435
02:04:53,888 --> 02:04:55,936
It is hard for me to gain

2436
02:04:56,192 --> 02:04:56,960
Irrelevant

2437
02:04:57,216 --> 02:04:58,240
It's of my field

2438
02:05:01,056 --> 02:05:02,592
Okay I can say

2439
02:05:03,104 --> 02:05:03,616
Is that

2440
02:05:03,872 --> 02:05:05,152
You know I can't divorce

2441
02:05:05,408 --> 02:05:05,920
Myself

2442
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:09,248
I'm stuck

2443
02:05:09,504 --> 02:05:10,016
Optical

2444
02:05:10,272 --> 02:05:12,064
Call Enterprise of capitalism

2445
02:05:12,320 --> 02:05:12,832
Alien

2446
02:05:16,672 --> 02:05:22,816
Space capitalism

2447
02:05:23,072 --> 02:05:25,376
Capitalism capitalism part of the problem

2448
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:27,168
Yep yep

2449
02:05:27,424 --> 02:05:33,568
Talk to argue with that this isn't really relevant to Byfield

2450
02:05:33,824 --> 02:05:35,360
Claim of expertise on on

2451
02:05:35,616 --> 02:05:36,384
That is

2452
02:05:36,640 --> 02:05:42,784
Currency or whatever and impulse that I appreciate greatly because a lot of people

2453
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:48,928
A lot of this skeptical quote a quote people could look at that it's like a way to dodge the question

2454
02:05:49,184 --> 02:05:49,696
But that's

2455
02:05:49,952 --> 02:05:51,232
No in reality.

2456
02:05:51,488 --> 02:05:57,632
Only five you're an anthropologist being interviewed about something like in a

2457
02:05:57,888 --> 02:06:03,008
Normal media setting at their like what about the Deep floor of the banking system

2458
02:06:03,264 --> 02:06:09,408
I don't know they just really inappropriate questions for my field of expertise

2459
02:06:09,664 --> 02:06:12,224
For that

2460
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:17,344
Do something to carry is really interested in his who's like the new Chris Alex

2461
02:06:17,600 --> 02:06:23,744
Who is Vee like person if you had to make one

2462
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:27,840
You'd never be able to guess this

2463
02:06:28,864 --> 02:06:29,632
He was the

2464
02:06:29,888 --> 02:06:31,424
Technocrat

2465
02:06:32,192 --> 02:06:34,752
Which was the Martians from for prefecture governor

2466
02:06:36,544 --> 02:06:37,568
Okay well let's

2467
02:06:38,592 --> 02:06:39,360
Use that analogy

2468
02:06:39,616 --> 02:06:40,128
Who's who's

2469
02:06:40,384 --> 02:06:40,896
Now that purse

2470
02:06:41,664 --> 02:06:42,176
Pass the roll

2471
02:06:45,248 --> 02:06:46,016
So

2472
02:06:47,296 --> 02:06:47,808
Currently

2473
02:06:48,832 --> 02:06:49,600
Figurehead

2474
02:06:50,624 --> 02:06:51,392
Who official

2475
02:06:51,648 --> 02:06:52,416
Riverside

2476
02:06:52,928 --> 02:06:53,952
Donald

2477
02:06:54,720 --> 02:06:56,512
The highest office on Mars

2478
02:06:56,768 --> 02:06:57,536
Still call

2479
02:06:58,048 --> 02:06:59,072
Supreme

2480
02:07:00,096 --> 02:07:00,608
Because

2481
02:07:03,424 --> 02:07:04,704
That is a clone

2482
02:07:05,728 --> 02:07:06,496
David Bowie

2483
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:10,848
I'm serious

2484
02:07:11,360 --> 02:07:13,408
There is a gold shall transmission

2485
02:07:14,688 --> 02:07:15,712
EU

2486
02:07:16,992 --> 02:07:18,016
To upload

2487
02:07:18,272 --> 02:07:18,784
Consciousness

2488
02:07:20,064 --> 02:07:20,832
And reincarnate

2489
02:07:21,344 --> 02:07:21,856
On Mars

2490
02:07:24,416 --> 02:07:25,440
So there are Acts

2491
02:07:25,696 --> 02:07:26,976
Actually a number

2492
02:07:27,232 --> 02:07:28,512
High-profile

2493
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:29,792
Dad

2494
02:07:30,304 --> 02:07:30,816
Celebrities

2495
02:07:31,072 --> 02:07:31,584
On Mars

2496
02:07:32,096 --> 02:07:33,120
Allowed

2497
02:07:33,376 --> 02:07:33,888
Emigrate

2498
02:07:34,656 --> 02:07:35,168
Using this

2499
02:07:35,424 --> 02:07:35,936
Gold chain

2500
02:07:38,240 --> 02:07:38,752
And

2501
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:40,800
A young version of

2502
02:07:41,056 --> 02:07:41,824
David Bowie

2503
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:44,896
I'm sorry what

2504
02:07:47,712 --> 02:07:48,224
Okay

2505
02:07:48,736 --> 02:07:49,760
And for Earth

2506
02:07:50,016 --> 02:07:56,160
So it's surprising information

2507
02:07:56,416 --> 02:07:58,464
AI

2508
02:07:59,232 --> 02:08:00,512
The other point person

2509
02:08:00,768 --> 02:08:01,536
Right right

2510
02:08:01,792 --> 02:08:07,936
Kelowna David Bowie

2511
02:08:08,192 --> 02:08:09,984
If that were available

2512
02:08:10,752 --> 02:08:12,032
Now sure

2513
02:08:12,288 --> 02:08:18,176
I think it would I think it would open up a lot of questions about whether clones can hold office

2514
02:08:18,432 --> 02:08:21,504
Also we have to be like oh my God they can clone humans

2515
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:26,112
Yeah but and let me throw it out at the end you this direction

2516
02:08:26,368 --> 02:08:29,184
Bowie's All Those Questions go out the window

2517
02:08:29,440 --> 02:08:34,304
Self

2518
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:37,888
Conversation comes up about Venus

2519
02:08:38,912 --> 02:08:44,544
Because there's talk of a nuisance carry his heard from there

2520
02:08:46,336 --> 02:08:49,152
Happened

2521
02:08:49,920 --> 02:08:50,688
Is there any

2522
02:08:50,944 --> 02:08:51,712
Truth to

2523
02:08:51,968 --> 02:08:52,992
The minutiae

2524
02:08:54,016 --> 02:08:54,528
You know

2525
02:08:55,040 --> 02:08:56,064
Sore and various

2526
02:08:57,088 --> 02:08:57,856
Visitors

2527
02:08:58,112 --> 02:09:01,440
From I'm sorry stores from Venus are you familiar at all with

2528
02:09:02,720 --> 02:09:03,488
Yeah socks

2529
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:07,584
Venus so I'm not I are you aware that during the

2530
02:09:07,840 --> 02:09:08,608
Space race

2531
02:09:11,168 --> 02:09:11,680
The space race

2532
02:09:11,936 --> 02:09:12,960
During the Cold War

2533
02:09:15,008 --> 02:09:16,288
Soviet Union was obsessed

2534
02:09:16,544 --> 02:09:18,080
Venus like Americans were

2535
02:09:18,848 --> 02:09:20,384
So there's actually like

2536
02:09:20,896 --> 02:09:22,688
There's a German pre-World War

2537
02:09:24,224 --> 02:09:26,272
Colony on Mars

2538
02:09:26,528 --> 02:09:27,552
There's a Soviet

2539
02:09:31,904 --> 02:09:32,672
Different from ours

2540
02:09:34,976 --> 02:09:36,000
With Eli.

2541
02:09:37,792 --> 02:09:38,304
Alannized

2542
02:09:38,816 --> 02:09:40,096
Buy the other side of the iron

2543
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:43,168
So there is

2544
02:09:43,680 --> 02:09:44,448
Is there a song

2545
02:09:45,728 --> 02:09:46,496
You know it

2546
02:09:47,264 --> 02:09:48,032
Soviet

2547
02:09:48,544 --> 02:09:49,312
Colonialism

2548
02:09:49,568 --> 02:09:50,592
If you want to call it that

2549
02:09:50,848 --> 02:09:51,616
Debatable whether you

2550
02:09:52,384 --> 02:09:52,896
Colonialism

2551
02:09:53,408 --> 02:09:54,176
But they are

2552
02:09:54,432 --> 02:09:54,944
There

2553
02:09:56,224 --> 02:09:56,736
He once

2554
02:09:57,760 --> 02:09:58,784
Fundamentally Jeffrey

2555
02:10:01,088 --> 02:10:01,600
Theory behind

2556
02:10:03,904 --> 02:10:04,416
Actually

2557
02:10:04,672 --> 02:10:05,696
Disagree with the

2558
02:10:06,208 --> 02:10:06,720
Soviet

2559
02:10:06,976 --> 02:10:07,488
Empire

2560
02:10:08,256 --> 02:10:09,280
I think Empire ism

2561
02:10:10,816 --> 02:10:12,096
There were certainly

2562
02:10:12,864 --> 02:10:13,376
Problematic

2563
02:10:15,424 --> 02:10:16,192
Farmhouse

2564
02:10:17,984 --> 02:10:18,496
Seem like

2565
02:10:22,336 --> 02:10:22,848
Anime

2566
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:25,408
Former Colonial

2567
02:10:26,944 --> 02:10:27,712
Then

2568
02:10:28,224 --> 02:10:29,248
The United States

2569
02:10:31,296 --> 02:10:31,808
Died of

2570
02:10:34,112 --> 02:10:34,880
Considering how many

2571
02:10:35,648 --> 02:10:36,672
Democratic election

2572
02:10:39,744 --> 02:10:40,256
The world

2573
02:10:43,584 --> 02:10:44,864
Okay but.

2574
02:10:45,120 --> 02:10:45,632
Get that kitchen

2575
02:10:47,168 --> 02:10:49,216
Is operating

2576
02:10:54,848 --> 02:10:55,360
Lionel

2577
02:10:55,872 --> 02:10:57,408
Vinyl

2578
02:10:57,664 --> 02:10:59,712
Lionel okay

2579
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:01,504
I'm not done yet

2580
02:11:06,880 --> 02:11:07,392
Alright

2581
02:11:07,648 --> 02:11:08,672
I will call you as soon as I

2582
02:11:13,024 --> 02:11:13,536
Thank you sir

2583
02:11:14,304 --> 02:11:18,400
Okay I

2584
02:11:18,656 --> 02:11:19,680
Sandra Under Pressure here

2585
02:11:21,984 --> 02:11:23,264
Can't do the same bit twice

2586
02:11:23,776 --> 02:11:25,824
I do however like the

2587
02:11:26,080 --> 02:11:27,104
Thank you sir

2588
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:33,504
At the end of how do I appreciate that brings home a certain level of

2589
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:36,576
It also has

2590
02:11:36,832 --> 02:11:38,112
A vibe of I'm

2591
02:11:38,624 --> 02:11:43,232
Sort of taking a risk by talking to you

2592
02:11:43,488 --> 02:11:49,120
I'm inconveniencing myself in some ways information and have this conversation

2593
02:11:49,376 --> 02:11:55,520
But I think I was I wasn't super into the B first time right

2594
02:11:56,288 --> 02:12:01,408
Not so into it the second I m to the B because the B isn't

2595
02:12:01,664 --> 02:12:02,944
Openly a bit

2596
02:12:03,456 --> 02:12:06,016
So all you're doing is redoing the B

2597
02:12:06,272 --> 02:12:06,784
Twice

2598
02:12:07,040 --> 02:12:11,648
It's a call back to people who would watch it who get it

2599
02:12:11,904 --> 02:12:15,488
Sure but even then it is that mean yes

2600
02:12:15,744 --> 02:12:17,792
It is a call back but the

2601
02:12:18,304 --> 02:12:19,584
The original is it called

2602
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:21,120
Back to our joke

2603
02:12:21,376 --> 02:12:23,168
You know what I'm saying so it's it's like

2604
02:12:23,424 --> 02:12:24,960
Yeah doing the same bit again

2605
02:12:25,728 --> 02:12:26,752
Yeah yeah

2606
02:12:27,008 --> 02:12:30,080
And it's not because you're trying to do the same but again it is

2607
02:12:30,336 --> 02:12:36,480
Buyer the meteor only way that I really kind of give this pass is if this was

2608
02:12:36,736 --> 02:12:42,880
Play polite way for him to try to end the interview

2609
02:12:43,136 --> 02:12:46,976
I didn't really get that sense necessarily I have no idea but

2610
02:12:47,232 --> 02:12:53,376
If it were just a way to like I have to leave or whatever then

2611
02:12:53,632 --> 02:12:56,448
Takes on a different it's not as much f****** around in Morrow

2612
02:12:56,704 --> 02:13:00,288
Like having a robust way to the train bacon exit

2613
02:13:01,568 --> 02:13:07,712
But now I don't know I don't love it he was scrambling to try and fit Russia onto V

2614
02:13:07,968 --> 02:13:10,272
Venus while at the same time making sense of

2615
02:13:10,528 --> 02:13:12,576
Colonial pass for America and Russia

2616
02:13:12,832 --> 02:13:14,368
To me that is like

2617
02:13:14,880 --> 02:13:15,904
I'm going to need a break

2618
02:13:22,560 --> 02:13:28,704
Going to fit the Soviet colonialism in any kind of

2619
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:34,080
Distracted by it thinking I would say end the interview also a

2620
02:13:34,336 --> 02:13:40,480
This is more in the territory of stuff that carries asking him as opposed to Wood like this story that he's

2621
02:13:40,736 --> 02:13:45,088
So maybe there is a

2622
02:13:45,344 --> 02:13:50,720
Less-is-more slipperiness a good time

2623
02:13:50,976 --> 02:13:56,608
I feel like I'm sure the topic of child trafficking comes up

2624
02:13:56,864 --> 02:13:58,656
Cuz of course this is a big deal for Carrie

2625
02:13:59,168 --> 02:14:01,728
Perspective on this whole thing

2626
02:14:02,240 --> 02:14:03,776
And we haven't even talked about the

2627
02:14:04,032 --> 02:14:04,544
The child traffic

2628
02:14:05,056 --> 02:14:05,568
Issue

2629
02:14:06,080 --> 02:14:06,848
That's very much

2630
02:14:07,872 --> 02:14:08,640
The Reptilian

2631
02:14:09,664 --> 02:14:10,176
On planet Earth

2632
02:14:10,432 --> 02:14:10,944
Then humans

2633
02:14:11,456 --> 02:14:12,992
So you know that's a whole

2634
02:14:13,504 --> 02:14:14,016
She was well

2635
02:14:15,808 --> 02:14:17,856
Yeah I don't know if you want to touch any of that

2636
02:14:18,112 --> 02:14:22,208
Closing remarks the wedding you make some closing remarks

2637
02:14:23,232 --> 02:14:24,256
Stacks work on Mars

2638
02:14:25,792 --> 02:14:26,304
Walking on Mars

2639
02:14:28,864 --> 02:14:29,888
Mars

2640
02:14:31,168 --> 02:14:31,936
Legal

2641
02:14:32,192 --> 02:14:32,960
Unionized

2642
02:14:33,216 --> 02:14:33,728
Adult

2643
02:14:36,544 --> 02:14:37,056
No

2644
02:14:37,312 --> 02:14:39,104
Labor trafficking children

2645
02:14:40,384 --> 02:14:41,408
Now in

2646
02:14:41,664 --> 02:14:43,456
In the Chrysalis era

2647
02:14:43,968 --> 02:14:44,480
You had

2648
02:14:44,992 --> 02:14:45,760
Child labor

2649
02:14:46,016 --> 02:14:47,552
You had found soldiers

2650
02:14:47,808 --> 02:14:48,320
Carburetor

2651
02:14:48,576 --> 02:14:49,600
Hifiman

2652
02:14:50,624 --> 02:14:51,392
In our previous

2653
02:14:51,648 --> 02:14:52,160
Interview

2654
02:14:52,416 --> 02:14:53,440
Was probably around

2655
02:14:55,488 --> 02:14:56,512
That was

2656
02:14:58,560 --> 02:14:59,072
Wife

2657
02:15:00,864 --> 02:15:01,376
But

2658
02:15:01,888 --> 02:15:03,680
President David Bowie

2659
02:15:05,216 --> 02:15:05,984
Gone to

2660
02:15:06,240 --> 02:15:06,752
Greenlight

2661
02:15:07,008 --> 02:15:08,032
Ensure

2662
02:15:08,544 --> 02:15:10,336
That's human trafficking operation

2663
02:15:12,128 --> 02:15:13,920
In orbit and intercepted

2664
02:15:14,432 --> 02:15:14,944
Bi-Mart

2665
02:15:17,760 --> 02:15:18,784
There is no charge

2666
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:21,088
Anyone who is

2667
02:15:22,112 --> 02:15:23,136
Aspen School bias

2668
02:15:25,184 --> 02:15:28,000
Siri if your viewers are are listening and

2669
02:15:28,256 --> 02:15:28,768
Really

2670
02:15:29,024 --> 02:15:30,048
Want to know what will make

2671
02:15:30,560 --> 02:15:31,072
Difference

2672
02:15:31,584 --> 02:15:32,352
In the lives

2673
02:15:32,608 --> 02:15:33,376
Children

2674
02:15:33,632 --> 02:15:34,400
There is one piece

2675
02:15:35,680 --> 02:15:36,704
Give anyone

2676
02:15:37,216 --> 02:15:37,984
Really wants Megan

2677
02:15:40,288 --> 02:15:40,800
And that is

2678
02:15:41,568 --> 02:15:42,080
Sperm

2679
02:15:42,336 --> 02:15:43,104
And accept

2680
02:15:43,872 --> 02:15:44,640
Lgbtq

2681
02:15:49,504 --> 02:15:50,272
Okay

2682
02:15:52,832 --> 02:15:56,416
Quite understand

2683
02:15:56,672 --> 02:16:01,792
No it takes

2684
02:16:02,304 --> 02:16:03,072
I'm sorry

2685
02:16:03,328 --> 02:16:05,888
What

2686
02:16:06,144 --> 02:16:12,288
That makes sense in terms of reality

2687
02:16:12,544 --> 02:16:16,128
You apply real-world advice into this fantasy scenario

2688
02:16:16,384 --> 02:16:17,408
Yeah right

2689
02:16:17,664 --> 02:16:20,992
No I mean 82 it is fascinating because she

2690
02:16:21,248 --> 02:16:21,760
You know

2691
02:16:22,016 --> 02:16:23,296
He's right

2692
02:16:23,808 --> 02:16:29,952
You have to take on a journey to understand why you know like if you want to show your work as to why affirm

2693
02:16:30,208 --> 02:16:31,232
Lgbtq

2694
02:16:31,488 --> 02:16:37,632
Children is going to put a dent in human trafficking

2695
02:16:37,888 --> 02:16:42,240
Wait Awhile and you know not that hard though

2696
02:16:42,496 --> 02:16:48,640
It would take a long time and she would disagree a lot on the way to get distracted by a number of things

2697
02:16:48,896 --> 02:16:55,040
In the real world Dino statues about the vulnerability of

2698
02:16:55,296 --> 02:16:56,320
Btq yufu

2699
02:16:56,576 --> 02:17:00,160
You know don't have supportive structures around them often times

2700
02:17:00,672 --> 02:17:05,792
Higher incidences of running away on house gas at a young age

2701
02:17:07,072 --> 02:17:13,216
These are all things that put people in a position where they are at the higher

2702
02:17:14,752 --> 02:17:16,288
They advise that he's giving

2703
02:17:16,800 --> 02:17:17,824
Is good

2704
02:17:18,080 --> 02:17:19,104
Great

2705
02:17:19,616 --> 02:17:22,944
I'm not sure that carry fully understands that though

2706
02:17:23,712 --> 02:17:24,480
Okay

2707
02:17:25,248 --> 02:17:27,040
But how does that

2708
02:17:30,112 --> 02:17:30,624
Why

2709
02:17:32,160 --> 02:17:33,952
Because those children are special

2710
02:17:34,208 --> 02:17:34,720
Vulnerable

2711
02:17:38,560 --> 02:17:39,328
That's a fact

2712
02:17:40,096 --> 02:17:41,376
Actually

2713
02:17:41,632 --> 02:17:42,912
Been a state Witness

2714
02:17:43,168 --> 02:17:43,680
Jobs

2715
02:17:44,192 --> 02:17:44,960
Multiple

2716
02:17:48,032 --> 02:17:49,056
Okay I'm

2717
02:17:49,824 --> 02:17:51,104
Take that at face value

2718
02:17:52,384 --> 02:17:55,712
How is that difficult for you to take at face value

2719
02:17:55,968 --> 02:17:56,480
Prominently

2720
02:17:56,736 --> 02:17:57,760
From what I understand

2721
02:17:58,016 --> 02:17:58,528
You know

2722
02:17:58,784 --> 02:17:59,552
White men

2723
02:18:02,112 --> 02:18:05,184
Yeah they are they are run primarily by white men

2724
02:18:05,696 --> 02:18:06,720
And there's

2725
02:18:07,232 --> 02:18:07,744
Sting called

2726
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:09,024
You know what is an essay

2727
02:18:09,280 --> 02:18:10,048
Adrenochrome

2728
02:18:10,304 --> 02:18:10,816
Highway

2729
02:18:11,584 --> 02:18:12,352
And your

2730
02:18:12,608 --> 02:18:13,120
Your kind of

2731
02:18:13,376 --> 02:18:14,144
Intimating that

2732
02:18:14,400 --> 02:18:15,424
Their particular

2733
02:18:15,936 --> 02:18:17,216
Ask you a kind of

2734
02:18:17,472 --> 02:18:17,984
Child

2735
02:18:19,264 --> 02:18:21,056
And you know

2736
02:18:21,568 --> 02:18:22,080
So

2737
02:18:22,336 --> 02:18:23,872
I only know about

2738
02:18:25,408 --> 02:18:27,712
Child trafficking as Ivan

2739
02:18:30,016 --> 02:18:31,808
Someone who has had some interaction

2740
02:18:32,064 --> 02:18:33,856
Social workers and therapists

2741
02:18:34,112 --> 02:18:34,624
Educators

2742
02:18:35,392 --> 02:18:36,672
I don't know about any of this

2743
02:18:36,928 --> 02:18:37,696
Football stuff

2744
02:18:37,952 --> 02:18:39,488
Oh I know.

2745
02:18:39,744 --> 02:18:40,512
Space Program

2746
02:18:41,536 --> 02:18:44,352
Well okay are they jump

2747
02:18:45,376 --> 02:18:46,912
Secret space

2748
02:18:47,168 --> 02:18:48,448
Rings but I think

2749
02:18:48,960 --> 02:18:49,984
The

2750
02:18:50,240 --> 02:18:52,800
I think there's a lot of misinformation about

2751
02:18:53,056 --> 02:18:54,336
What that looks like

2752
02:18:54,848 --> 02:18:55,360
FairPoint

2753
02:18:55,616 --> 02:19:01,760
And also did the you can see here the way the Carrie is a misunderstanding

2754
02:19:02,016 --> 02:19:07,136
Is that the people who are doing the Rings to eat

2755
02:19:07,392 --> 02:19:13,536
They like to drink lgbtq blood right as opposed to being intolerant

2756
02:19:14,048 --> 02:19:19,424
Puts people in systems without situations without strong support Networks

2757
02:19:19,936 --> 02:19:24,032
And that makes them more susceptible

2758
02:19:24,288 --> 02:19:26,592
In a in higher-risk

2759
02:19:26,848 --> 02:19:32,992
Circumstance placed in a weak position they are taken advantage of

2760
02:19:33,248 --> 02:19:36,064
Buy strong Russian people

2761
02:19:36,320 --> 02:19:41,184
I think that's really interesting that that's how Carrie process is it

2762
02:19:41,696 --> 02:19:47,840
Yeah it makes sense for her to process it that way because it made no sense for me to even think

2763
02:19:48,096 --> 02:19:50,912
Think that that was a possible way to process it so of course she did

2764
02:19:51,424 --> 02:19:54,496
I never would not have occurred to me

2765
02:19:54,752 --> 02:20:00,896
That means they like a special kind of blood did not occur to me but I think I think it's

2766
02:20:01,152 --> 02:20:04,480
Because in her conception it's not

2767
02:20:04,736 --> 02:20:07,808
This issue isn't something that exists

2768
02:20:08,064 --> 02:20:14,208
By way of it within the context of society structures

2769
02:20:14,464 --> 02:20:17,280
Rates of homelessness

2770
02:20:17,536 --> 02:20:22,144
A child Runaway Runaway these things aren't factors

2771
02:20:22,400 --> 02:20:24,704
The go into human trafficking for her

2772
02:20:24,960 --> 02:20:26,496
For her it's just

2773
02:20:27,264 --> 02:20:32,896
I don't know children are commodity or something like I prefer this flavor

2774
02:20:33,152 --> 02:20:36,224
Or whatever you know it's leave that

2775
02:20:36,736 --> 02:20:42,880
I don't know if it's bizarre well she doesn't that mean and I think that's the way that a lot of people view it is that they don't

2776
02:20:43,136 --> 02:20:49,280
View there I mean our complicity in the entire structure

2777
02:20:49,536 --> 02:20:50,048
Society

2778
02:20:50,304 --> 02:20:51,840
They don't view it as something that

2779
02:20:52,096 --> 02:20:56,704
We are participating and they view it as the Super Evil powerful men

2780
02:20:56,960 --> 02:21:03,104
Are doing it to us you know right they are trafficking children because that's whatever they want and it

2781
02:21:03,360 --> 02:21:08,736
It doesn't matter what situation they're in they can grab any child they're all powerful that kind of thing

2782
02:21:08,992 --> 02:21:10,784
It doesn't occur to them that like

2783
02:21:11,040 --> 02:21:13,856
By way of society functioning as it does

2784
02:21:14,624 --> 02:21:17,184
Are there you know that kind of thing

2785
02:21:17,696 --> 02:21:23,840
Yeah and it's an interesting perspective the carry does not quite understand even close

2786
02:21:24,096 --> 02:21:25,632
Burg doubling down

2787
02:21:25,888 --> 02:21:26,400
On this

2788
02:21:26,656 --> 02:21:28,704
Ending message that he wants to send

2789
02:21:29,216 --> 02:21:30,752
But part of the reason that

2790
02:21:34,080 --> 02:21:36,128
And when people is fertilized

2791
02:21:36,896 --> 02:21:37,664
Ignorant

2792
02:21:37,920 --> 02:21:38,432
Balaji

2793
02:21:39,200 --> 02:21:40,480
About

2794
02:21:40,736 --> 02:21:41,248
Like

2795
02:21:42,016 --> 02:21:43,040
Like obviously apps

2796
02:21:44,832 --> 02:21:45,344
But like

2797
02:21:46,112 --> 02:21:46,624
Just

2798
02:21:46,880 --> 02:21:47,392
You know

2799
02:21:47,648 --> 02:21:48,672
Rolling around

2800
02:21:49,184 --> 02:21:49,952
The app

2801
02:21:50,208 --> 02:21:52,512
Pedophile at anyone that have

2802
02:21:53,024 --> 02:21:53,536
Relentless

2803
02:21:55,328 --> 02:21:56,352
And it's not going to leave

2804
02:21:56,608 --> 02:21:57,632
To any kind

2805
02:21:59,424 --> 02:21:59,936
Progress

2806
02:22:00,448 --> 02:22:00,960
Or Mark

2807
02:22:01,472 --> 02:22:01,984
Naperville

2808
02:22:02,752 --> 02:22:04,544
I will double down on it

2809
02:22:04,800 --> 02:22:05,312
Play It Again

2810
02:22:05,824 --> 02:22:07,360
If you are listening to this

2811
02:22:07,872 --> 02:22:09,408
And you want to really make a difference

2812
02:22:10,176 --> 02:22:11,456
In the lives of

2813
02:22:11,712 --> 02:22:12,224
Kids

2814
02:22:12,480 --> 02:22:13,248
Who are the most

2815
02:22:13,504 --> 02:22:14,272
Vulnerable

2816
02:22:14,784 --> 02:22:15,808
Child trafficking

2817
02:22:16,576 --> 02:22:17,088
Sperm

2818
02:22:17,600 --> 02:22:18,880
LGB

2819
02:22:22,976 --> 02:22:23,488
Okay

2820
02:22:23,744 --> 02:22:25,280
I'm not sure why anyone

2821
02:22:25,536 --> 02:22:26,048
Wouldn't

2822
02:22:27,072 --> 02:22:28,864
Wow lady

2823
02:22:30,400 --> 02:22:31,936
Wow alright

2824
02:22:32,960 --> 02:22:34,240
Thank you very much

2825
02:22:34,752 --> 02:22:36,288
Yeah major

2826
02:22:36,544 --> 02:22:38,592
You know it is so much fun

2827
02:22:38,848 --> 02:22:39,872
To talk to you and

2828
02:22:40,384 --> 02:22:41,664
There's so many other

2829
02:22:41,920 --> 02:22:42,688
Questions

2830
02:22:42,944 --> 02:22:44,224
Places we could go

2831
02:22:44,736 --> 02:22:45,248
So I

2832
02:22:45,760 --> 02:22:47,040
Sincerely hope you'll come back

2833
02:22:47,808 --> 02:22:51,136
I want to let you go so you don't get in any more trouble than you already are

2834
02:22:51,648 --> 02:22:52,672
Finals going to be

2835
02:22:52,928 --> 02:22:53,440
Tested me

2836
02:22:54,208 --> 02:22:56,000
Yeah and I don't want him pissed

2837
02:22:56,256 --> 02:22:57,536
Instant miso

2838
02:22:57,792 --> 02:22:59,328
Let's narcissist down

2839
02:23:00,608 --> 02:23:05,472
The ending this with inviting him back and saying like I don't want you to get in more trouble

2840
02:23:05,728 --> 02:23:08,288
Accepting the reality of that phone call

2841
02:23:08,544 --> 02:23:14,688
So it doesn't seem like these things that he has brought into the

2842
02:23:14,944 --> 02:23:21,088
The conversation are deal breakers in terms of whatever potential I guess

2843
02:23:21,344 --> 02:23:22,112
Insider

2844
02:23:22,368 --> 02:23:26,976
Two to the ongoing narratives of Project Camelot

2845
02:23:27,232 --> 02:23:30,816
Yeah I don't know if we'll do a 3rd episode

2846
02:23:31,328 --> 02:23:37,216
My sense on it is I-10 great job

2847
02:23:37,984 --> 02:23:42,336
This is it this is well. I think the first one was great job this is

2848
02:23:42,592 --> 02:23:46,688
Good job I mean I mean insofar as maintaining the

2849
02:23:46,944 --> 02:23:53,088
Real reality of what you're doing while at the same time being able to improvise somewhat

2850
02:23:53,344 --> 02:23:55,136
Still within that reality

2851
02:23:55,392 --> 02:24:01,536
Anmol able to play along with her reality on that 12 hours

2852
02:24:01,792 --> 02:24:07,936
What is tough to do I think I think that is just those phone calls weren't there

2853
02:24:08,192 --> 02:24:14,336
I might have a like a solid marks all over there

2854
02:24:14,592 --> 02:24:19,712
That are provided by the allegorical story of the history of Mars the

2855
02:24:19,968 --> 02:24:22,528
Messages that you get with like the

2856
02:24:22,784 --> 02:24:28,928
The idea that the Draco sent their unwanted and they became productive members of The Martian Society

2857
02:24:29,184 --> 02:24:34,560
This stuff about not seeing the groups of aliens as

2858
02:24:34,816 --> 02:24:40,192
Like determined by their group their personalities and their capabilities and their character

2859
02:24:40,448 --> 02:24:43,776
The stuff about the druze and his group

2860
02:24:44,032 --> 02:24:47,872
Being a big the way you see them from inside versus outside

2861
02:24:48,128 --> 02:24:52,736
The bringing an affirming lgbtq in general

2862
02:24:52,992 --> 02:24:55,296
Existence and rights

2863
02:24:55,808 --> 02:25:01,696
These things are very positive and then existing in the space is extremely good

2864
02:25:01,952 --> 02:25:04,256
Yeah it is I also don't

2865
02:25:04,512 --> 02:25:06,816
No I don't have a ton of faith

2866
02:25:07,328 --> 02:25:07,840
They

2867
02:25:08,096 --> 02:25:11,680
It will make as much of a difference to carry

2868
02:25:12,192 --> 02:25:15,520
Like I don't know if he'll be able to swing her over to

2869
02:25:16,032 --> 02:25:18,848
Accepting some of this more

2870
02:25:19,104 --> 02:25:24,736
I mean if we're going to if we're going to say to people

2871
02:25:24,992 --> 02:25:27,552
F****** don't clown on Alex because

2872
02:25:27,808 --> 02:25:33,952
He doesn't care about the 10 people who clown on Alex it's the one person who comes over and starts watching a show

2873
02:25:34,720 --> 02:25:35,488
Phuc yea man

2874
02:25:35,744 --> 02:25:40,864
Don't act the f*** it click Carrie and her ilk are going to be f***** up there's no chance of that but if there's

2875
02:25:41,120 --> 02:25:43,680
One out of every ten people watching that goes

2876
02:25:43,936 --> 02:25:45,472
Ship that is a perspective

2877
02:25:45,984 --> 02:25:49,824
Yeah you know what I think that they are there is something to that

2878
02:25:51,104 --> 02:25:57,248
Yeah it's hard it's hard though because it's hard to accept that and and maintain the

2879
02:25:57,504 --> 02:26:03,648
Feeling that I have that is other people shouldn't do this is because outside

2880
02:26:03,904 --> 02:26:05,184
That phone call I don't

2881
02:26:05,440 --> 02:26:08,000
Feel like I said I don't feel like this is a prank

2882
02:26:08,256 --> 02:26:10,304
And I don't know if

2883
02:26:10,560 --> 02:26:11,072
Wood

2884
02:26:11,584 --> 02:26:17,728
Believe that most people could handle doing this in a non-malicious way

2885
02:26:17,984 --> 02:26:18,496
Well

2886
02:26:18,752 --> 02:26:22,592
I think part of the reason that we shouldn't do another episode on this

2887
02:26:23,104 --> 02:26:24,128
Is because

2888
02:26:25,152 --> 02:26:31,296
The first one we had plausible deniability now we've stopped

2889
02:26:31,552 --> 02:26:37,696
I convinced myself she is not accurate

2890
02:26:37,952 --> 02:26:44,096
He didn't know there were signs but we didn't know for sure even some of the signs until after

2891
02:26:44,352 --> 02:26:50,496
Ignorance

2892
02:26:50,752 --> 02:26:56,896
So we weird we're back here and this is golden I think if we do it again we're doing the same thing

2893
02:26:57,664 --> 02:27:00,224
Cuz all we can really an analyzed here

2894
02:27:00,480 --> 02:27:05,344
Because we don't really have to analyze too much of of his story I mean

2895
02:27:05,600 --> 02:27:11,744
Alright like he doesn't have those those wide swaths of yada yada yada is where if you put that in there

2896
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:18,144
Is like trying to jump into

2897
02:27:18,656 --> 02:27:24,800
The reality where this person believes what they're saying is kind of some of the fun of it

2898
02:27:25,056 --> 02:27:28,384
Weirdo style and it's too obvious but he doesn't believe this stuff

2899
02:27:28,640 --> 02:27:32,736
It's not like even said you have to integrate you're looking at it as like

2900
02:27:32,992 --> 02:27:35,552
Oh this is the allegorical and metaphorical

2901
02:27:35,808 --> 02:27:37,344
Thing that that is being said

2902
02:27:37,600 --> 02:27:38,368
And that's

2903
02:27:38,624 --> 02:27:41,696
Fun enough but I text real analysis essential

2904
02:27:41,952 --> 02:27:44,000
Exactly it is definitely that

2905
02:27:44,768 --> 02:27:45,280
End

2906
02:27:45,536 --> 02:27:47,840
22 the point of it's not a prank

2907
02:27:48,608 --> 02:27:50,400
That is 100%

2908
02:27:50,656 --> 02:27:51,680
Correct

2909
02:27:52,192 --> 02:27:54,496
And why I agree with you people shouldn't do this

2910
02:27:55,008 --> 02:27:55,520
Because

2911
02:27:56,032 --> 02:27:56,800
Unlike

2912
02:27:57,056 --> 02:28:01,920
I pranking somebody where they're they're taking on the trappings

2913
02:28:02,176 --> 02:28:08,320
Of their bulshit in order to embarrass them yeah this feels like a person who learns the language to speak

2914
02:28:08,576 --> 02:28:14,720
To these people in sort of yeah

2915
02:28:17,280 --> 02:28:17,792
Sort of

2916
02:28:18,560 --> 02:28:24,704
Tolerances the butterfish I don't think if anything he's trying to communicate

2917
02:28:24,960 --> 02:28:27,008
Through their world

2918
02:28:27,264 --> 02:28:28,800
We learn through our history

2919
02:28:29,568 --> 02:28:33,408
There is there is a feeling of that

2920
02:28:33,664 --> 02:28:37,760
I think that the first episode was a revelation in terms of like

2921
02:28:38,272 --> 02:28:41,344
This is bizarre this is completely out of sync with

2922
02:28:41,600 --> 02:28:47,232
Suspicious if we didn't do any episode about him coming back

2923
02:28:47,488 --> 02:28:53,632
Yeah but in the future I don't take cover every time he's on or anything but for us it's for them

2924
02:28:54,144 --> 02:28:58,496
Sure I love those we wish you well I hope I hope that

2925
02:29:00,544 --> 02:29:04,128
Sharing with us

2926
02:29:04,640 --> 02:29:10,528
This guy would listen to this so my messages are having only two he doesn't listen

2927
02:29:10,784 --> 02:29:16,928
Some sort of a malicious intent that you're waiting to reveal because that'll make me feel like s***

2928
02:29:17,184 --> 02:29:23,072
He'll turn us on top of fooling us on top of fooling Carey

2929
02:29:23,328 --> 02:29:26,144
If you've got the trifecta of blue

2930
02:29:26,656 --> 02:29:32,800
God damn then I mean more respect to your crystalyx but I ain't got nothing for that. That's not the

2931
02:29:35,360 --> 02:29:36,896
Baby

2932
02:29:37,920 --> 02:29:39,968
Anyway I will be back Jordan

2933
02:29:40,224 --> 02:29:46,368
But until then we have a website

2934
02:29:47,392 --> 02:29:53,536
If I'm Leo I'm dcx

2935
02:29:55,072 --> 02:29:55,840
What the sex robot

2936
02:30:00,192 --> 02:30:03,776
Alexandra Thurston color
