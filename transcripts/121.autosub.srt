2
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:19,456
About Alex Jones in some sort of

3
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:24,832
That would make

4
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:26,624
You listen to

5
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:35,072
About an episode

6
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:41,728
As we usually do to our lives I was going to transition today

7
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:44,032
My next turn

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,944
Super-awesome

Great news I don't know if you guys have a great time

11
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,304
How to make it sound

12
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,328
Nice

13
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,864
But I also think

14
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,912
Extra theater playground letting us do that

15
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:14,752
I like I like the way they let us run the show which it seems like

16
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:17,568
When we started the show everybody just left

17
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:23,968
There was the sound guy and then there was nobody else there stuff

18
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:28,832
I have no idea there were more employees

19
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:34,464
There was no rules forgot to make one of the big points that I wanted

20
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:40,608
To the episode that will Air tomorrow

21
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,936
Probably but also that

22
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:46,240
The want the point that I wanted to make about alley

23
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,776
What's John's in that episode

24
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,312
Especially

25
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,336
Almost everything else

26
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,896
Is that he never takes the time to get

27
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:53,920
Stories

28
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:57,248
You know what I'm saying and that's one of the most dangerous things

29
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,808
By the people in media and

30
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,088
Especially people in

31
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,368
Persuasive media

32
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:08,256
Right he knows in this case he knows he has

33
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,536
Like two days or so

34
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,328
To get a story out before the facts

35
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,400
Anyway

36
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,472
Is looking good

37
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:22,592
Keep that in mind that is a really dangerous thing

38
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,872
Closet

39
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,200
And then listen to us

40
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:31,040
I don't do that but anyway I would also like

41
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:36,416
To say thank you

This is something that I found

60
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:57,824
Is that

61
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,896
Every April Fool's Day

62
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,688
I thought that might be some fun

63
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:08,320
Really it wasn't the kind of fun I was looking for like most April Fool's Day

64
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,904

Tells a story

Through most of the show

69
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:18,815
It's one of the best

70
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,351
Experian

71
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,631
This story

72
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,399

73
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:27,007
It's about a vacation that he had taken recently and autobiographical

74
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:32,639
This is the Halloween story all over

75
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:36,479
Perversion

76
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,807
Exciting I love it the first one

77
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:45,183

Company at my house

82
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:05,663
I just was in the hot tub

83
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:09,503
One guy was from Portland Oregon engineer

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,295
Businessman

Alright Google storage

88
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:52,255
All three of them

00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:55,327
How to solve America's problems

90
00:05:56,095 --> 00:06:01,215
Because they're all listeners they know that cyprus's problems are our problem

91
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:01,983
Because if

92
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,287
The globalist

93
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,103
And then one of them no no

94
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:10,687
I didn't hear a different guy I know too much

95
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,967
It's a different guy

96
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:15,039
I heard him

97
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:17,855
Different guy

98
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,647
Different

99
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:23,743
For a secret in this situation

100
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:27,583
Well you'd be thrilled

101
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,423
But it's not a secret globalist in so much as it's one of the people he's hanging out with

102
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:37,823
In the in the hot tub

103
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,895
Chorus and he's like

104
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,527

Nevermind

108
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,767
That's fine story

109
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,303
There's some red

110
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:01,375
But he was going out to break at this point we didn't have time to

111
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,911
To fully flesh out the story

112
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,959
So now he comes back from break

113
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,727

Unnecessary details

129
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,399

I think

158
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,351
Written well by Kate Chopin

159
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,399

00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:33,503
Exactly what the internal monologue of this government scientist globe

Authoritarian

164
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,343
I mean if you see a man

00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,111

00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,415
What will you be wearing that

167
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,439
That makes him look like

00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:50,143
Could have been

170
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,447
You're in luck

171
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,239

Some details

173
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:01,151
About 10 minutes later he tells the story

174
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:10,111
He isn't his Workshop in this story

175
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:17,535
Little bit third telling of it

The most ridiculous

196
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,215
They have real

197
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,695
There's a little more spliff

198
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,743
Do he admires his father

199
00:14:55,999 --> 00:15:02,143
I think there's a little more to the clipboard is like this Authority

200
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,983
Old man was like you stood there for 20 minutes point to get Alex

201
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,263
20 minutes because

202
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,799
Does he say anything or is

203
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:13,407
Apparently I accuse you

204
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,503
Just like

205
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,831
I think he's insinuating authoritarian

206
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,111
Cuz he was around Alec

207
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,159
Like there's something about Alex

208
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:26,207
His toughness that rubs off on other

209
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,559
Okay

210
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:34,911
There's a little more to the clip here let's see the rest of the story holes

211
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:35,935
Those words

212
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,871
Strong winds around me

213
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:47,967
But it was just watching

214
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,111
And he was laughing

215
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:01,023
Smart

216
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,815
People

217
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:05,887
Obamacare raise taxes on

218
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,855
Who was the white guy

219
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,903
All this doesn't make sense like Noah

220
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,463
No one babes like this

221
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:38,143
All of it where's your first hole in this

222
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,935
How can we punch up the store

223
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:41,983
I would have

224
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,775
Like a page

225
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:49,407
Page one rewrite just from scraps start over again

226
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:53,503
Condense the three guys here's what I would do to get rid of

227
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:05,023
It's unbelievable if you hanging out

228
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:05,791
Wyoming

229
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:06,559
Go for it

230
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:10,399
That's an okay you got to have a driving force

231
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:16,799
No because it goes to grocery stores and people turn into demons when they look at him

232
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:23,199
Stephen King

233
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,247
It's like that there's always going to be the guy

234
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:31,647
Right right there is a unreliable narrator situation in anytime

235
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,695
A story about his own

236
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,999
I we know lives Fight Club

237
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:40,863
I think that's what's really going on here everyone else wants to

238
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:44,191
To fight with him part of his psychosis

239
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:48,799
We're having a lot of fun we're laughing because obviously not true story

240
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:51,871
Flowers vacation

241
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:56,223
Now we should be serious about

242
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,759
No you should be serious

243
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,551
This

244
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,599
Event in Alex Jones Is Life

245
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,879
Had some serious.

246
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,143
Nightmares

247
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:18,495
After I talk to that guy Saturday night I woke up I don't really use a nightmare

248
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:22,079
Oh no

249
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,871
I woke up just

250
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,151
Sweat

251
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:36,159
But they're so horrible and so weak and so evil

252
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,999
And so dangerous and so pathetic

253
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,095
Because they hate goodness

254
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:46,143
They hate success

255
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,751
That doesn't track

256
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,031
Viral scientist

257
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:55,103
Also not true but

258
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:59,199
Big deal yeah I mean if he wouldn't be a nobody if that is

259
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:04,319
True

260
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,671
It doesn't track logically

261
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,695
To be like

262
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,999
These people are so evil and they wanted

263
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,023
Destroy ubiq

264
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,303
Cuz they're nobody

265
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,631
How to destroy the world

266
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,167
Text Billy

267
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,191
Well

268
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,751
But that's just a pathetic

269
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,287
George W bush rhetoric

270
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,847
Like they hate our freedom that's like that

271
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:30,943
I hate George W bush

272
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:33,247
I think he's a monster tried to pitch this war on us

273
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,039
Then he uses the same rhetoric

274
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:37,087
Against his imaginary enemy the global

275
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,367
Bizarre

276
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,927
Bright very bizarre

277
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:41,695
Both enemies

278
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:44,511
Ultimately the same thing and that's brown

279
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,519
Well

280
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:56,799
We both hate

281
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,103
Agreement

282
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,127
The whole day

283
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,687
Set story for now

284
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,711
Yeah but

285
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:06,271
April 1st

286
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,807
We do fine

287
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,391
It's not good

288
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,927
It's mostly this story

289
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,487
But at the end of it

290
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,255
We get a visit

291
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,279
From one

292
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,071
Shattuck okay

293
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,911
Make it pushing the Sandy Hook was fake

294
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:23,679
Narrative

295
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,215
Alex

296
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:29,311
Are in the hot tub I can tell you all of it

297
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,615
67

298
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:35,455
Tearing up

299
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,991
Fake fake mustache

300
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,271
Britannic

301
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,575
Alright

302
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,111
Everybody in Alex

303
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:42,879
Is life

304
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:45,439
Is living a concert Make-a-Wish for Ally

305
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:47,743
Everybody always

306
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:53,119
Listen in all of his stories

307
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,679
Give him something

308
00:20:55,935 --> 00:21:02,079
Finger talk about the baby kids

309
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,175
Told every single day that Alex

310
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,479
Needs to be the best day

311
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:13,855
I think there's another theory

312
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,416
But if you use the logic of people like Steve pieczenik

313
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:20,000
You could say that everyone Alex runs into his princess

314
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:25,888
Dugood tray that

315
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:26,912
That's very classic

316
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:31,264
Kind of

317
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,384
Boyhood

318
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,664
12 year long

319
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,688
Wingfield

320
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:42,272
Everybody f****** with Alex Jones I couldn't I couldn't handle watching it

321
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:45,344
Cuz I know the consequences are this

322
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,464
Very good prank but unfortunately

323
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:54,048
Explaining

324
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:56,352
Pretty early on why you believe

325
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,376
Sandy Hook

326
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,144
The false flag

327
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,472
Also DACA what is your take on

328
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,224
Black actors

329
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,272
What's your take on this

330
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:16,320
Xanax

331
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:20,928
Sandy Hook

332
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:23,232
Call erupt

333
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:26,560
Call The Hunger Game movies

334
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,776
Society

335
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,456
Siri

336
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,504
That's where it comes from

337
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,112
Sandy Hook that's a big part of their either Sandy Hook Theory

338
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,672
And because Susan Collins

339
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,208
This from

340
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:57,536
Call her

341
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:00,608

342
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,888
No comment

343
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,776
She doesn't have anything why would she comment other than to an official Outlet possibly

344
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,080
You make a great point

345
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,920
Seacomm how f****** soft is this s***

346
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,224
What else does Susan Collins have today

347
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,576
You could make the argument that like a you know

348
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,600
I don't know

349
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:25,184
Doesn't movie The Faculty

350
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,768
Usher Usher Raymond

351
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,560
Usher did it

352
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,864
Usher wasn't bald

353
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,632
Musician

354
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:38,240
It's cool

355
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,032
Right

356
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:43,616
This is this is this is a disaster

357
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,200
Nobody shall have

358
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:47,968
The Japanese

359
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,136
A person

360
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,416
Millions of dollars

361
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,696
Albert like

362
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,000
It bums me out cuz Alex

363
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,792
Is wrong about so much

364
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:05,376
And I never knew that the like sorted Genesis of

365
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:08,192
This seriously it's coming from Steve

366
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,752
And 100 is one of his big resources on this

367
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:16,640
Look Susan Collins from there she wrote

368
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,224
That's not

369
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,248
That's not any

370
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,808
It's always being plication then

371
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,088
The government hired

372
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:28,416
Her to write the Sandy Hook massacre probably

373
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:35,072
Fluor predictive programming through the Jungle Games book

374
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:41,216
Susan, we don't even know how to fall asleep I get the dog scenario

375
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:43,520
We need a script writer

376
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,800
Because week

377
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:47,104
The Sandy Hook massacre

378
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,664
We need Harrelson

379
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,504
How would you even begin to write

380
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,272
The Sandy Hook Beach

381
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,368
Would you just look back at all of the other school shootings that we've had

382
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:01,184
Better Health

383
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:05,280
Right

384
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:08,608
The Hunger Games is nothing like so I can you do

385
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,448
I feel like we

386
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,984
Shouldn't have to say that

387
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,384
Terms of a

388
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:25,248
All those sorts of things though

389
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,040
The similarities

390
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,208
Kids died

391
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,512
I guess that's the big one

392
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,840
School

393
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:46,496
Alright then he goes on to talk about crisis actors and that's a load of bull.

394
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:51,104
Crisis actors all this

395
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,200
You look into all that those argue

396
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,272
Those are for that macaroni

397
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,040
Not macaroni

398
00:25:59,296 --> 00:25:59,808
Swiss

399
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:03,136
My friend

400
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:08,000
I wish they had something better but they don't

401
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,608
Same thing that we talked about over and over again

402
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:15,168
Telling stories before there is a story

403
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,448
In order to get ahead of

404
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,264
Like right right it just

405
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,544
Making stuff up

406
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,080
Making out

407
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,360
Implications

408
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:26,432
Insinuations that are irresponsible and that's

409
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,272
Caught on

410
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,296
I crazy

411
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:33,600
Alex

412
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:39,232
Maybe that's the connection

413
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:41,024
Conspiracy

414
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:43,840
Yeah

415
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,632
Susan Collins

416
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:50,496
Alex Jones didn't start Sandy Hook shooting like that

417
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,800
But

418
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:53,824
Publicized

419
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,176
One of his big

420
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,968
Big guy pieces of logic is

421
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:01,760
Hunger Games

422
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:02,784
Ridiculous

423
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,064
Anyway

424
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,648
Do We Go From Here onto April 2nd

425
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,672
Is that

426
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:15,584
JK Rowling what are you talkin about what are the highest-grossing

427
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,888
Come on come on come on

428
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:22,496
Alright April 2nd

429
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,032
Headspace on the April 2nd

430
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:27,872
Things off with a little bit of vodka

431
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,408
About the UN

432
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,152
Little in the grass their helmets get big

433
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:08,832
When they're finally done making you hate the police

434
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:19,840
Yeah 77

435
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,632
It sounds great

436
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,448
Sure does

437
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,216
Preceded it

438
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,008
Q76

439
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:29,568
Q78

440
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:31,872
7770

441
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:34,176
Get rid of the entire military

442
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:36,736
I feel like one of the other on either side has

443
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:39,296
Similarly good you're asking stupid questions

444
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,088
Every other one is like

445
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:43,904
Using the toilet

446
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:48,768
Next

447
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:54,912
Mention this before I didn't realize it was such a huge part of Alex Jones

448
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,728
Beliefs about the

449
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,800
Is a duck

450
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:03,104
That was put out

451
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:06,432
Amor

452
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:08,224
The United States program for General

453
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,248
Complete disarmament

454
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,528
Peaceful world

455
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,552
Are released into

456
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,344
September of 1960

457
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,232
Weapons

458
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,024
Taken

459
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,864
Away not weapons taken away from everybody but the escalation of arm

460
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:28,448
The reason for that is there in the middle of the f****** cold war

461
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,472
I don't

462
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,776
Primarily what is about is

463
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:34,336
Reducing the risk of nuclear war

464
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:36,128
It doesn't really have to do

465
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,920
With disarming population

466
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:40,480
As it does with the United States

467
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:43,296
And the f****** Soviet Union getting together

468
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:45,600
And negotiating to not use nukes

469
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:48,416
And to make sure that other countries don't

470
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,696
Operation

471
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,720
The nuclear weapon

472
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:53,280
So this is just something that was written

473
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,304
By the states

474
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:56,864
Submitted

475
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,680
The UN wishlist

476
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:05,056
It's conceivably submitted to the UN but one of the things that you can do is you can go

477
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,080
To the UN

478
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:06,848
Website

479
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:08,384
You know what they have

480
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,664
They have minutes

481
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,712
Of every assembly that they have

482
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:13,248
So I went back to the

483
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:15,808
The 16th General Assembly

484
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,344
From 1961

485
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,368
And look through it

486
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:20,672
Is there anything here

487
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:23,744
Every single Un General Session

488
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,280
Every every single one

489
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:27,584
Even some of the stuff it seems Petty as hell

490
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,352
Like they're just

491
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,888
Making Proclamation

492
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:34,752
That's largely what they do they have General Assembly

493
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:38,848
They generally don't end up saying like

494
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:42,432
What he's doing is that they say

495
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,736
It is our feeling

496
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:47,552
That what we the people should pursue

497
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,320
Is

498
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:54,208
Do you like me not using nuclear weapons at like that

499
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:58,560
So much like the cloward and Piven

500
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,864
And I've discussed by professors

501
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:07,520
Jose

502
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,640
General Assembly

503
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,200
2

504
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,480
The laziness of human

505
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:20,832
That literally every single you and General Session

506
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:21,856
You can go and read

507
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:23,392
And there are still

508
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,160
Conspiracy theory

509
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:31,328
16th assembly pulled up and the 17th

510
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:39,264
He was a good one was great if I was going to rent all of the UN General Assembly

511
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,800
Start with 70

512
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:43,104
The sex was amazing

513
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,920
Of course in the top five

514
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,456
Is number one but that's really just a

515
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:49,248
The Legacy Thing lyrics

516
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,440
You know the general assembly documents they have the entire minute

517
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,464
It's just stuff like this

518
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,280
Admission of the Republic of Rwanda to membership

519
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,048
The United Nation

520
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,840
They're things that are proposed

521
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:05,376
And then they discuss them

522
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,168
And they're all listed in here

523
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,984
And most of them

524
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,544
Some of it is about money

525
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,592
A lot of it is about

526
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:15,872
Disposition

527
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:16,640
Dispensation

528
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:18,176
Money

529
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,712
Steamship status

530
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,808
Stuff about

531
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:24,832
Kneading

532
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:28,672
Fill positions and stuff like that it's the minutes of a boring meeting

533
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:30,464
Order 72

534
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:34,048
But there's also stuff on there about like nuclear disarmament

535
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:39,424
What Alex talks about this rule 7277

536
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,448
He's not

537
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,728
Steven passed as

538
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:42,752
United

539
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:43,520
States

540
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:44,288
And it's not

541
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,824
Something it was even put to the

542
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,128
The floor in the UN General Assembly

543
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:50,944
So it's nothing it's just something that someone wrote

544
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,184
I'm kind of inspired inspired by this level of

545
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,792
He doesn't take the context of documents

546
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:07,072
Exciting into account

547
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:09,376
The fact that he still sites that one

548
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:11,424
Dumbass thing about chemtrails

549
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:15,520
Articles

550
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:20,128
It means like well that was also something that the virus scientist admitted to him

551
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,152
In the hot tub

552
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,224
Nefariously

553
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,784
20 minutes

554
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,832
Now this is a whole new wrinkle on Alec

555
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:31,136
Text that I want

556
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,160
To be in a hot tub

557
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,696
And just happy

558
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:34,720
Say random

559
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:40,352
It's close enough for jazz

560
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:41,376
Now I just am a

561
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,912
Every story of his

562
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:43,680
Hamburger hot

563
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,216
Didn't he wears a chain

564
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:47,008
I feel like he wears a chain when it gets in

565
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:53,664
Probably never never were any other time she'll press

566
00:33:56,992 --> 00:34:00,832
If you wanted to make some other critiques of the unob game

567
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:04,416
For them cuz the UN does have a lot of impotent

568
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:05,440
Enforcement

569
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:07,232
Human rights

570
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:10,816
And a lot of the employees of the UN have been caught doing some

571
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:11,840
Pretty bad s***

572
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,472
I'd be all for it

573
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:18,752
What is there like

574
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:22,848
Focuses on the international

575
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:24,896
As far as

576
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:25,664
Correctness

577
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,272
Vioc view Olympic Committee

578
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:38,464
Okay still top three

579
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,488
On International

580
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,024
Sprint number

581
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:43,840
Globalist

582
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,888
Global

583
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,168
Number 12

584
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,192
AT&T

585
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:51,008
Weird weird

586
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,288
Sprint

587
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,312
Not a fan

588
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:58,944
But the UN does

589
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:06,880
IPods

590
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:12,000
But this isn't about you and this

591
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,536
Made

592
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,560
Facetious

593
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:15,328
Argument

594
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:16,352
About

595
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,936
Killing kids up till three years of age or something like that

596
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:22,240
Be more of a thought experiment than anything else it was

597
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,264
Serious proposal

598
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,592
You're alone in that opinion

599
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:31,200
But

600
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:34,784
Whoever made this facetious argument

601
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:45,280
The way he says it it means the other thing ever

602
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:48,864
Caught a lot of people

603
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,360
Right there is

604
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,896
Problem for his future

605
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:01,664
Sometimes

606
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,968
I just like to imagine I'm with the New World Order

607
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:08,832
Disney list all the things that he did for Trump what I'm thinking like

608
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:11,392
He's showing some signs like going to be on the f******

609
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:21,632
Dream

610
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,936
Favorite

611
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:25,728
But here we go

612
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:27,776
The Wanted

613
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,104
As they poison as they destroyed my future

614
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:41,088
Look at Obama and he's for me he likes me

615
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,488
Kill the babies

616
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:52,608
Eighteen-month-old walk-around

617
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:56,192
That's not the shots

618
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:00,288
The government

619
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:09,504
Magazine

620
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,784
Pizza

621
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,064
Move stuff

622
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,880
Magazine back at this point

623
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:17,696
At this point he's selling a magazine

624
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:20,768
Spreads

625
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:22,048
I don't know what

626
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:22,816
So

627
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:25,632
You mean he was right on time and getting into the prison

628
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:29,472
Gets back to the UN

629
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:38,688
I should get all the get all of the Infowars magazine

630
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,808
I know you see Miss America up there saying I love the UN and

631
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:48,160
Percival starving

632
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:56,352
Helped

633
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,120
Ohmwrecker

634
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:59,936
No killing

635
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:04,032
And if you wanted to look at it

636
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,104
It's barbecue

637
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:10,432
Roast chicken over fire

638
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:12,736
They were there with machine-gun shut up

639
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,552
When I had

640
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:23,744
And then they tried to get out of the campsite

641
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:30,912
Come up

642
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:39,104
The operations

643
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:41,152
So Alex thinks

644
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:42,944
Rolando was a false flag

645
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,736
Right

646
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:50,112
I like to read to you from this article about

647
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:53,440
If you Google if you type in the exact words

648
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,208
He says nothing

649
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:55,232
Comes up do not

650
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,792
Even if something did come up don't trust

651
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:01,632
What's the first link on that

652
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:08,544
Conversation

653
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,128
Helena

654
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,944
She was in Rwanda

655
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,248
Un peacekeeping soldiers were there

656
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,528
Here is a quote for

657
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:21,088
Indicates what one of the bigger issue

658
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,136
Do you want respond

659
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,440
We could not believe that the United Nation

660
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:26,976
Just going to let us die

661
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:29,536
We're always here in the radio how they were there to help us

662
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:33,888
When the killers were looking at in the eye and say we were going to die what did the UN do

663
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:38,496
That's really the issue

664
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,288
Man that's really more the issue

665
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,336
Of the response there was

666
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:46,432
There was not a there was not enough resources there wasn't enough

667
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:52,832
To even the motivation necessarily to resolve the issue

668
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:54,112
They've bungled

669
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:55,648
If you go back and listen

670
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:57,440
The interviews with Romeo Dallaire

671
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,208
The guy who was

672
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:00,256
We are the head of the troops there

673
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,792
It's some of the most heartbreak

674
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:03,328
Wingstop to hear him talk about

675
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:06,144
What he wanted to do and what he wasn't able

676
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,680
To do that sort of stuff

677
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:08,960
Terrifying

678
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:09,728
To hear

679
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:14,080
Alex wants to make the argument metaphorically that the UN

680
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,640
Killing of I think was 800,000

681
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,408
Some people.

682
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,712
But it's If he if you want

683
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:20,992
To make that argument

684
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:24,832
It is true in the sense that they didn't do what they could have done

685
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,624
But it's not true

686
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,648
But they were BBQ

687
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,672
Children

688
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:29,952
Right

689
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:30,976
That's now

690
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:32,768
Can Alex get me

691
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:34,048
Me in touch with that virus

692
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,584
Question number one

693
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,376
I don't know you question number two

694
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:39,936
He said there a way to devise a virus

695
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,216
The only kills wife

696
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:42,752
Question number three

697
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:44,288
All of them

698
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:51,200
He did say that he gave the other guys robbed email address but probably not the authoritarian I would imagine

699
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:51,968
No I feel like they

700
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:55,808
It goes on

701
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:56,576
Pichu

702
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,344
How to not be a

703
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:03,232
The part of a radical Islamic terrorist

704
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:20,640
There's a dude

705
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:27,296
As the

706
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:36,000
Right-wingers

707
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:40,096
It's so funny

708
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,120
Spyglass

709
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,656
So sick

710
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,704
I think it might be a real laugh

711
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:46,752
And he also admitted

712
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:47,776
Right-wingers

713
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,824
Hey tomorrow

714
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:55,711
You said must remember this

715
00:41:55,967 --> 00:42:02,111
This time Park part of a bigger thing that he's talking about that he's like it's so silly they're going to try

716
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:04,927
And save it right-wingers are working with Al-Qaeda

717
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:06,719
Which is ironic cuz now he's a

718
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:08,511
Entire argument is that the left

719
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:10,815
Is working with Al-Qaeda

720
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:11,839
Andar

721
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:13,887
What

722
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,167
What fantasy

723
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:23,359
And pretend to be terrorists

724
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:26,431
Well that's what he thinks like with Oklahoma City

725
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,967
He thinks that that

726
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:34,879
Is that Alex likes

727
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,671
To say he was just a good guy

728
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:38,207
He was a good guy

729
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:39,487
Is it normal

730
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,767
Jive

731
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:41,791
Who they had

732
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:43,583
Go be a part of white suit

733
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:44,351
Supremacist

734
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,887
Violin amp

735
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:48,447
Organization

736
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,983
And make you look bad

737
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:55,871
He didn't know was real he thought it was a drill

738
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:59,711
Alex Alex

739
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:00,735
Explain that

740
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:01,759
Together this drill

741
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:04,831
What could this drill sir I think

742
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:09,439
Purpose of the drill would be in fiery to catch other people who want to bomb something

743
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,719
I think that's what he think

744
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:12,511
He never really spells it out

745
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,047
Alex doesn't really get

746
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:15,839
That part of the narrative.

747
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:16,607
It's bad

748
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:19,423
It's the only way

749
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:22,239
Wiggle his way out of white

750
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:25,567
White terrorism

751
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,103
He makes it that far

752
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:32,735
It was a setup and he wasn't even a white supremacist

753
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:39,135
I know he was at those those weird militia meetings and stuff I know that you know people who testified

754
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:40,159
They saw him there but that

755
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:44,511
Did the military had to make it look like the bad guy

756
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,559
It's so stupid

757
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:52,191
He talks about how right-wingers will do anything

758
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:54,495
To prove that they hate Al-Qaeda

759
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,055
It doesn't make sense

760
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:58,079
Well then

761
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:01,919
You could totally use

762
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,735
Okay two lives in there go

763
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:05,759
Yeah yeah

764
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:10,623
Alex tells of what

765
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:13,951
Spoiler alert

766
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,231
Very dumb

767
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:19,071
We must be totally divided into racial and religious

768
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:22,399
Districts

769
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:25,983
The Hunger Games

770
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,775
Floating fortresses

771
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:33,151
Getting a lot of work for the government

772
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:42,367
At 120,000 feet with microwaves

773
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:50,047
Years ago I saw him bragging about it

774
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:56,191
So Alexander Haig

775
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:58,751
Is the former Secretary of State

776
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:04,383
The blind but it is actually

777
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,663
Do you know if you look into it

778
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:12,319
Alexander Haig was involved in government

779
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:15,903
He decided to get a bunch of people together and start a business called

780
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:16,927
Skyspace

781
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:19,487
Is it what they were doing

782
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,255
Is they work

783
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,023
Create

784
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:22,303
Giant balloons

785
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:23,839
4

786
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:24,863
Telecommunication

787
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:27,935
To just over Giant

788
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:28,959
Satellites out

789
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:29,983
Space

790
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:31,007
Lower

791
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:34,079
They would provide internet coverage

792
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:35,103
Three entire cities

793
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:39,199
Great idea

794
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:44,063
They would provide like a relay point for phones

795
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:47,135
Scientists

796
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,671
Together and

797
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:49,695
Get this done

798
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:52,767
They didn't work

799
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:54,559
Yeah

800
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:55,839
It didn't work out

801
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,143
So

802
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,215
Remove

803
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:02,239
I know cuz if

804
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:03,007
Giant

805
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:09,663
Look the reason that it hasn't been done I want to verify this blimp story

806
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:12,735
Do the blimp Story part of it is real in the sense

807
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:13,503
What's that like

808
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:16,063
We're trying to make a

809
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,623
But it was for internet

810
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:20,927
It was way ahead of its time

811
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:22,719
It's okay for this Alex

812
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:26,303
Blimps those are the good old days

813
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:28,607
This was that this is back when I was

814
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:31,167
2014 article in Newsweek

815
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:32,703
Developed

816
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,471
Had promised

817
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:39,871
What blimp at 65000 FT above the city I could have served all of the 1990s level internet traffic from the

818
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:40,895
7 below

819
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:42,943
A blimp could stay up for 5 years

820
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:44,479
But as with other scheme

821
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,271
Time killed Skype

822
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:48,319
We ended up life

823
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,087
Sing the technology

824
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:51,135
Did someone else and walked away Alex Hayes

825
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:53,183
Nothing

826
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:53,951
Has come of it

827
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:57,535
Microwave

828
00:46:57,791 --> 00:47:00,095
Microwave fry

829
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:03,167
They were trying to find ways to service population

830
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:05,471
Alright

831
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:07,263
New investment opportunity

832
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:09,567
Knowledge fight blimp

833
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:10,335
Internet service

834
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:13,407
Okay well I think we're going to run into a problem

835
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:15,199
Sky say something

836
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:16,991
Not the way to make money

837
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:18,783
Blimp startup

838
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:25,695
Looks dark not talk any more of it or less

839
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:26,719
Steeler ideas

840
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:29,023
Our brilliant ideas

841
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:33,375
This next clip

842
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:34,911

Insurrection

867
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:07,327
Possibly

868
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,351
Of the men

869
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:13,727
I move that the idea

870
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:22,175
So ridiculous

871
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:23,199
You're out

872
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:26,015
The strengths to open up in

873

Irene

874
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:30,879
Maybe the

875
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:32,671
Test of manhood

876
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:34,719
Ability

877
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:37,279

Nails

887
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,399
Andrew Jackson

888
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:16,447
Why do you hate

889
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:18,495
And you'll be thrilled to learn

890
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:21,567
It's so did Davy Crockett

891
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:31,295
He's known as the man of the Wild Frontier and all that

892
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:33,855
He's known for all that s*** but in addition

893
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:34,623
Into that

894
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:35,903
Served

895
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:36,927
House

896
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:41,023
The key was a politician for a bit

897
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:42,303
He did Andrew Jackson

898
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:45,631
Absolutely not because

899
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:47,935
Particular

900
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:52,543
Somatic

901
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:58,943
American

902
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:03,039
Is there anything more

903
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:04,063
Andrew Jackson

904
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:05,087
Then Hayden

905
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:10,207
You might have a decent point they're super passionately against

906
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:12,767
The Indian Removal Act of 1830 Andrew Jackson

907
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:14,303
I was trying to pass

908
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,071
To be like

909
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:16,607
Pretty serious

910
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:21,471
And beyond that you had a lot of ideas about how Andrew Jackson was dealing with finances

911
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:22,239
And the bank

912
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,775
Do memes of like that

913
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:25,823
Yeah it's okay

914
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,615
About that Becky is

915
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:28,639
Very

916
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:30,943
Seriously got into rows with Andrew Jackson

917
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:36,063
Is emulating their only like 8 years apart

918
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:37,599
Or something like that

919
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:41,695
Born pretty close to each other in the only like

920
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:43,743
Time that they really come together is

921
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:45,535
In the Tennessee militia and

922
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:46,559
1802

923
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:48,351
The two of them serve

924
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:50,143
Together

925
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:51,167
But then Alex

926
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:52,447
Just jacking off more

927
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:54,495
Because he loves Andrew Jackson for whatever reason

928
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:55,775
Graphics

929
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:56,799
Descriptions of violin

930
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:59,871
Crockett apparently also died at the Alamo

931
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:04,991
Like our friend Colonel Travis

932
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:05,759
Default hero

933
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:07,039
For Alex

934
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:12,671
When throw into whatever argument

935
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:13,439
Anthony wants to have

936
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:14,207

937
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:16,511
David love Trump

938
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:21,631
Whatever you're making the shut up

939
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,167
So

940
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:24,703
At this point

941
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:27,007
On April 2nd

942
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:29,567

00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:23,743
You make it your business to lie about people

963
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:28,607
Brutally sanity probably don't exist the moment that he said

964
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:30,399
Straight up pointing

965
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:32,447
Started pointing myself

966
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:36,287
It is really hard to hold it for this long

967
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:38,847
The longtime to ridiculous amount of time

968
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:42,175
Like I do and I apply

969
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:42,943
Yeah

970
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:43,711
I'm starting to go numb

971
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:50,111
So the stories change now Alex Alex tells him.

972
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:58,047
I play bridge you know why he throws that in though it's to combine it with his narratives about his dad

973
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:10,335
Confirmed it by confronting his authoritarian Cyrus scientist

974
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:13,919
Oh no

975
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:14,943
Zagara's

976
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:19,807
I shouldn't have stood up pointed in revealed

977
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:22,623
I don't think there's first of all I mean that none of this is

978
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:29,023
There's no way he told the story three times in the first day

979
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:30,047
Send it

980
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:35,167
Little little bit difference

981
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:38,239
I like it

982
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:44,383
Long time to rip off that book

983
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:47,711
Yeah so we're one more clip Jordan here in April 2nd

984

00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:52,575
Little tight episode here little little hour long

986
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:53,855
For the people

987
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:58,975
Alex Jones

988
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:00,255
He's basically

989
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:03,839
Sort of doing his own version of that song that don't impress me much

990
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:05,887
Shania Twain song

991
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:07,167

992
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:07,935

00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:08,703
Car bed

994
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:09,471

995
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:15,615

00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:47,615
By worldly

1004
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:48,383
Play things

1005
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:56,831

1008
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:02,719
Expecting crying

1009
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:04,255
Want to

Secure unless you buy prison Plantation

1019
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:57,759

So take it personally with me

1022
