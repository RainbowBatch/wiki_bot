1
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:21,248
Sweaty

2
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I have great respect for knowledge by now I'm sick of them posing as you're through the good guy

3
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
MoneyGram

4

Alex Jones

7
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:12,192
Have you ever had something important

8
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,824
Surly important

9
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:21,664
I thought my car got stolen but it just got lost

10
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:30,112
In front of somebody else's house

11
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:34,464
Somebody's house forgot that it was there that woke up the next morning and

12
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,256
Thought it has been stolen

13
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,792
Wunderground

14
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,632
Don't think I really had too much

15
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,704
Come to my life

16
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,824
No not at all

17
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,104
The only thing I've ever had

18
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,920
For real

19
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,200
Super Mario World

20
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:55,968
Cartridge

21
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,784
That was stolen from me when I was in

22
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,552
Junior High

23
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:06,208
Sure over the course of my life.

24
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:11,328
I don't know why I remember that one

25
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,376
It's just a formative

26
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,912
CEFCU will Xperia

27
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,056
Stealing things in my life

28
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:30,272
Sometimes questioned the nature

29
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,296
How's this show

30
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:41,792
The victim of theft and I only know what you tell me about that's correct

31
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,632
Present day

32
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,400
It's been awhile

33
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,936

00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,616

What we got here in front of us

62
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,215
Is Friday

63
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,239
Episode where Alex is

64
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:01,567
Michelle

65
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,847
But Alex joke

66
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,615
Call Lynn

67
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:07,199
Little bit of content for a

68
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:07,967
To get into

69
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:08,991
It's really boring

70
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,551
Stupid but he does say one thing

71
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,575
Is very interesting

72
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,879
About his father's influence

73
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:15,647
On him

74
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:16,927
Okay

75
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:23,071
Alex Jones

76
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,847
People in college

77
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:46,879
Extrovert

78
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,631
History

79
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:03,007
Conspiracy behind all of these world

80
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,055
Courtney out the Czar in Russia

81
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:09,663
The global communism the French Revolution all of this being done by the

82
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,479
The belief system

83
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,759
Espoused by

84
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:16,831
The person we talked about on our last episode

85
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,391
Absolutely Christian identity

86
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,671
Alex

87
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,719
Learned a lot from

88
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,279
His dad Alex

89
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:30,399
Exact

90
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:38,079
No let me teach you about listen to this weirdo preacher from Waxahatchee

91
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,615
It does

92
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:42,431
Believe there may be a little bit more to

93
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:45,247
Dad was

94
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,271
Funneling

95
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,551
These Christian identity beliefs

96
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,367
Maybe that's

97
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:54,719
Bigger part of the story than we realize

98
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:58,559
What's a little indication

99
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,583
Sincere there that

100
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,119
That might say

101
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,911
Fertile soil there

102
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:07,263
So

103
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,615
Sunday

104
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,407
I wasn't expecting too much

105
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,943
On Sunday cuz

106
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,735
I was generally songs

107
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,807
Alex is on

108
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,343
Real crazy bull

109
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,623
Like

110
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:28,255
He's got a narrative that he believes

111
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,023
Is it going to be like

112
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,303
Game Change

113
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,375
Real stupid

114
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,471
And the present your 73 and everything

115
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,775
You don't have the internet really work

116
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:47,711
In the last three days have been lost on Facebook and Twitter of your bonafide

117
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,319
Then you have on both of your sweaters

118
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,855
Your Instagram everything else

119
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,903
Hundred

120
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,671
Million

121
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,463
Followers

122
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,095
74 million

123
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,143
1 + 40 something million 139

124
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:12,031
Hundreds of millions of years

125
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,591
Of your damned

126
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,199
Until

127
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,279
Douchebag

128
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,095
The Republican establishment

129
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,143
He's my friendship

130
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:41,983
He lost track of that sentence

131
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:44,543
He was really swinging for something

132
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:54,783
Together again

133
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,551
Metaphor

134
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:04,511
Part of Alex really talking directly to Trump through a lot of it

135
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:07,071
I don't know what's going on here

136
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:16,287
Is ultimately what we're going to get back to us

137
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:25,247
He's trying to backdoor on the Millions

138
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,551
Followers that he lost on those meme

139
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,415
To Alex

140
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,487
I think you're probably right

141
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:36,767
Motivation

142
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,375
So you didn't hear about this story of Millions

143
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,679
People being kicked off Instagram

144
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,215
I don't give a fuk about it

145
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:51,615
Well it's also not true story

146
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,663
200 million people have been kicked off

147
00:09:53,919 --> 00:10:00,063
Instagram because they support Donald Trump

148
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:03,135
Worldwide you have to pay close attention

149
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,463
He says the 200 million followers

150
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,023
Which is different than 200 million

151
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,559
People are ticked off

152
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,863
It's you know it that could just be

153
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:16,447
200 million

154
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:20,031
No Rebellion follows have been lost

155
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:23,871
What else is doing is trying to over-inflate the scope of this purge

156
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,895
Instagram worth

157
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,687
Kicked off

158
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,223
If you want to call

159
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:34,111
To give you some perspective if 200 million accounts were kicked off Instagram

160
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,183
Why is the number of people use Instagram of the United States

161
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:37,951
Pancake shop

162
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:41,535
That would be them removing approximately 1

163
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,303
Subscriber base

164
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,351
Which would completely crippled their

165
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,399
It's the sort of claim that's just

166
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:49,215
Absurd on its face

167
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,263
You should be embarrassed

168
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,871
In reality the number of followers of the affected accounts

169
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:04,319
And whatever number anyone can come up with just take into account that they probably have a overlap in the followers of these Meemic

170
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,367
So the number is

171
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,159
Exaggerated over-inflated

172
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:13,023
So on Thursday and Friday of last week

173
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,047
Instagram

174
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:19,167
With a spokesman for the company saying they were disabled following multiple violations

175
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,983
Including attempted abuse of our internal process

176
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:26,591
At the point of preparing this episode and recording

177
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,383
Exactly what the policy violation

178
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,223
But given how large social media

179
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:38,111
I'm willing to suspend judgment for the time being and wait and see what information comes out later before I take a really firm

180
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,135
Position on that

181
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,463
We've seen countless examples of people gaming social media

182
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:45,023
Sims 4 profit from the people who set up syndicates

183
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,071
Tweets go viral for a

184
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,119
Krassenstein Brothers do

185
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,935
He doesn't seem too unbelievable to assume that these accounts

186
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:54,751
Last week

187
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,031
Shutdown

188
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,335
Turn on political reasons at all

189
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,871
Yeah they're just abusing

190
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,151
The system like

191
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:04,223
For some context in situations like this

192
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:09,343
Best to find examples of times things like this have happened before and why they've happened

193
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,647
And in this case it's super easy

194
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,439
Inlay French Revolution

195
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:19,583
Exactly in late December 2018 Instagram had another Purge of accounts that violated their policy

196
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,375
In that instance of spokes

197
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:23,167
Fritz told the daily.

198
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:26,751
Quotes we see behavior on Instagram where buy some usernames

199
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:32,895
Usernames which contain a letter or number are stolen or trade it

200
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:35,711
This Behavior violates our policies in a number of ways

201
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:40,319
We don't allow people to buy sell or trade aspects of their account including user

202
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,111
We're consistently take

203
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,415
Steps to disincentivizing

204
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,439
Stop his behavior

205
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,975
Including removing account

206
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,511
Policy

207
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,815
Is part of an ongoing process

208
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:53,631
Like social media companies create new rules

209
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,911
Got down on scam

210
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:59,007
Dennis cameras find new ways around that rule in the process just starts over

211
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:00,799
Exactly

212
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:05,919
Instagrams been working on this since at least 2014 and billions of entitled

213
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,711
What I see something like

214
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,527
What happened last week it's pretty easy for me to see this is

215
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:13,343
Probably just another step in the process

216
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,367
Define tuning

217
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,159
They're making it so you

218
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:20,255
You can't expect

219
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,023
16 Brothers

220
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,815
It had been absolutely selling

221
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,239
Screenshots of them

222
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,663
But we'll see what happens if it's Instagram

223
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,991
I see every reason to suspend

224
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,271
Judgment

225
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:46,623
Discount very well may have been breaking the rules

226
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,719
And I also looked over the screen names for all the ones that were banned

227
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:55,327
Obviously I'm not some guy out there cruising Instagram

228
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,655
The freshest memes

229
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,983
But I looked through all the account names and none of them were like

230
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:08,639
Maga2020 yoga

231
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,687
69

232
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,735
I don't know I don't know that these were actually

233
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,271
We even accounts that were

234
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,551
Making Trump memes

235
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:20,671
It wasn't count dankula

236
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,439
Anyway

237
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:27,327
Also it's all about social media all the time

238
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,375
If you weren't just trying to bring up these topics

239
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,655
Completely self-serving

240
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,935
Positions

241
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,215
Wounded narcissism

242
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:38,079
Right now I would have imagined that he would bring up how sex workers are being pushed off social media faces

243
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,359
At least one

244
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,663
In the time that I've listened to him I've never heard of her

245
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:46,271
Cuz it does seem like he would have to be

246
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,551
You'd be okay

247
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,623
Is a libertarian

248
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:54,719
Absolutely has a f****** libertarian

249
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:59,071
The reason Alex is freaking out so much about this and exaggerating

250
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,351
To such an extreme level of

251
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:03,167
Would you point it the first is what you

252
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,959
He wants to get back on

253
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,031
It's exhausting

254
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:11,359
Publix in order to keep his name in The public's eye

255
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:15,199
But he doesn't do that is all business

256
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,223
Second

257
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:20,575
Ounces to Connected meme distributors

258
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:26,975
Who are able to create artificial virality are really the best option

259
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,815
Is social media companies are starting to address that problem on their platform

260
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:37,215
He knows that his ideas are going to have to compete on a Level Playing ground with other people and they're going to fail miserably

261
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:43,359
So this is at one of Alex's gigantic

262
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,127
Freaking out of

263
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,991
He's trying to I have to be super clear

264
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,783
He's trying to

265
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,807
Imply

266
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,343
And will directly say

267
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:59,743
200 million people got kicked off which is cooked

268
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:03,839
Number in any way is to say that the

269
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:10,239
Small number of accounts that got kicked off had a large following

270
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:16,895
It's completely insane that's like

271
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:19,199
3 billion listeners worldwide

272
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:24,831
Whenever the world listens to your show

273
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:27,135
Right including Baby

274
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:31,999
Another

275
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:36,863
We are facing promoters

276
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:44,799
I don't know I feel really out of my Lane

277
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:52,991
I feel exactly the same way I would feel if I tried to wear a hat backwards

278
00:16:56,063 --> 00:17:01,183
Don't do it

279
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:04,255
Instagram the part of it and then there's

280
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,023
More

281
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,583
Almost passed the bill

282
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,655
House of Representatives right now

283
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:16,287
Bipartisanship people $30,000

284
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,335
Which ones

285
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,199
Play gentlemen

286
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,295
Where this country

287
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,111
Thousand

288
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:30,879
Dollar

289
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:36,255
My listeners thought I was making it up

290
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,791
Didn't think it was real

291
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,327
Ichiban

292
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,119
Europe

293
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:47,007
I kind of like that vocal flourish there

294
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:53,407
In this narrative Alex's misrepresenting Deke alternative in small-claims Enforcement Act of 2019

295
00:17:55,967 --> 00:18:01,599
The actors designed to make it easier for holders of copyrights to protect their copyrighted protected work without having to subject

296
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:04,159
Corporate

297
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,975
Creating small claims

298
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,999
Court mechanisms

299
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,279
Simplify the process

300
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,839
Expedited and make it so

301
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:14,911
You don't have to exert tons of money in order to

302
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:18,495
Protect your material right is that does disincentivize people from

303
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,799
Protecting what

304
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,591
Desert Electric

305
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:25,151
If it cost you more to fight against

306
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,175
Then it would be to just

307
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,199
Just ignore it then why

308
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,135
Ultimately this legislation is not just

309
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,975
But here's the thing

310
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:42,559
What people are doing with me in many cases is already illegal

311
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:45,887
When it involves clearly copyrighted material

312
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,935
Technically

313
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:54,335
People are allowed to get away with it because most of the time the copyright holders know it's more hassle than it's worth to go after someone

314
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,615
Colibri

315
00:18:56,383 --> 00:19:00,223
The case act doesn't make anything illegal that was previously legal

316
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,783
It really is just about making it easier for people

317
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,831
To protect their own intellectual property

318
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:08,415
And for Alex super into property right

319
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,951
It doesn't make sense for him

320
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:12,255
To be opposed to people being able to

321
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,303
Defending their property

322
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,263
Obviously this kind of legislation could have a huge impact on me

323
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:26,847
But I find it very difficult to imagine

324
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,127
Succeeded going through

325
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:32,223
Do that much of an effect on how individual users of social media platforms

326
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:32,991
Used memes

327
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:38,367
I think it would just make it easier to sue people with large platform to profit off using copyrighted material

328
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:43,999
Interpret themselves by saying

329
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:51,935
It's hard to hear Alex misrepresenting the story and not think about how we just had to paint match your creator Pepe the Frog 15th

330
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,239
Dollars for you to use copyrighted material

331
00:19:54,495 --> 00:20:00,639
It'll poster that Infowars sold on their website

332
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,943
For Alex's legal strategy

333
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:06,271
Immediately after Fury and Alex reach their

334
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:09,087
Show to discuss

335
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:09,855
Placate

336
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,647
It was crystal clear

337
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:18,047
And it was basically boiled if you want to spend a ton of money suing Alex $15,000

338
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,607
They weren't defending their innocent

339
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,399
Sports

340
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:27,775
They were clearly signalling costly

341
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:32,639
For anyone to fight Alex in court so they give up or they don't even bring the suit in the first place

342
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:35,455
That's one of the ways Alex protect himself

343
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:38,015
Yeah it's similar to

344
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:41,855
Debt collectors

345
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:42,879
Credit card companies

346
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:45,695
And then they'll take you to court right but you will get

347
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,487
Most of them never show up

348
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,839
When did they wind up losing their case cuz they didn't

349
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,887
Show up interview show up you find out

350
00:20:54,143 --> 00:21:00,287
Traffic tickets that you automatically

351
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:03,103
But in a number of instances it's not worth it

352
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,127
To pay the cop

353
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,943
To go to court

354
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,735
Gets thrown out

355
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,295
If the case goes through

356
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:13,855
Alex is far more vulnerable in matters of copyright

357
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:19,744
I can't say for sure would lead to any actual potential

358
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,024
Really f****** worries

359
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:26,912
I suspected this is what's motivating

360
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:31,008
Also discuss now because it's like

361
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,288
He's presenting

362
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:38,688
The globalist

363
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,456
October

364
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,392
So I kind of also find it funny that Alex brings up out of the same as what was Europe last year

365
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,768
Because the EU rules

366
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:58,144
Also because the EU rules

367
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,728
Completely different thing then what Alex is talking about

368
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:05,824
He's in Europe if you posted

369
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,360
You're getting a fine

370
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,128
And that's absurd

371
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:12,736
41

372
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,528
Enforcement in the new age of two

373
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,296
Technology

374
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:19,136
Amateur reads about this rule from an article and wire

375
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:25,792
The most controversial part of the copyright directive

376
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:28,352

385
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:47,808
Being misused by their users as opposed to

All the consequences

387
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,368
Is falling on the individual user

388
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,464
Become their own cops

389
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,488
Instead of

390
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,376
Yeah

391
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,656
Implicit in the misuse

392
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,680
Intellectual

393
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,472
I also don't worry.

394
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,520
You rule didn't infringe on member states

395
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,288
Sovereignty

396
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:13,920
Each state was specifically left to their own devices to write their own laws and come up with how they would Implement practices

397
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,712
To protect copyrights through Europe

398
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,760
Nothing that I would says

399
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:20,064
It all is real

400
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:24,416
It's a whole just blustery bulshit he's hoping you'll add up to enough inside

401
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,440
Went to get Trump

402
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:31,840
To somehow Force Facebook and Twitter to let him back

403
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:32,608
So much like

404
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,656
Please

405
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,752
There's so much of that

406
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:42,080
I think it's probably in

407
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:44,128
Someway motivated by

408
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,432
The longer things go on

409
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:47,968
The worst in situations

410
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:56,160
That's simply not a thing

411
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,512
It would be an interesting

412
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,560
Consider how he

413
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:06,912
Yeah I mean I guess you can probably like takeaway

414
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:07,680
Relief

415
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:11,008
From these companies if they didn't allow Alex back on

416
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,288
Like it's some sort of

417
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:14,592
Pressure on the company's to allow it

418
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:19,712
Would you be really f***** up

419
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,480
Just like

420
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:22,784
Alex Jones

421
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:29,184
How many could I don't know how enforceable agreed to be really weird

422
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,024
I think is like a real trend of Alex's that we talked about a bit but

423
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,072
Over and over again

424
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:37,632
Well yeah I mean that's a big part of it

425
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:42,240
Can anti monarchy

426
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,336
Individuals are able

427
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,104
Go to do ever

428
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,664
Yeah

429
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,992
Some doubt really f***** up

430
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:59,136
Internet

431
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:12,704
Mister president give me back on Twitter

432
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,008
Tear down this wall

433
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:20,896
Alex breaks down

434
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:22,944
We all go.

435
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,736
And Trump is going to go down

436
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:26,528
Deal with it

437
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,576
Accounts

438
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,304
Cuz they're coming after me

439
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,352
What you saying

440
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,424
Watching Trump closely

441
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,960
Out-of-pocket advisor

442
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,080
Florida

443
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,784
Forgot to get those accounts back on

444
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:06,208
A little too clear

445
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:13,120
I think that Alex knows that he's got himself into a no-win situation largely because connecting himself so closely to Trump and his

446
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:20,544
By himself past the point of no return

447
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:23,872
Like what does he do if Trump loses in 2020

448
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:25,664
Legitimately what can he do

449
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:32,320
He's made the argument that this guy become president is America the last shot against the globalist want to destroy America and kill

450
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,088
Your family

451
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,624
What's he going to do

452
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:38,208
Is it going to tell his audience to gear up for the 2020 midterm

453
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,256
They're trying to start a big and Peach

454
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,792
Play when the system is

455
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:44,864
Already by definition controlled by the globalist

456
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,656
His audiences so far

457
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,680
Pass that s***

458
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:53,568
With demons and child sacrifice

459
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:55,104
Defining of these

460
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:58,432
If Alex tried to pave it back to being an opposition voice to

461
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:02,272
The party in power by advocating for anything short of armed insurrection

462
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:04,320
His audience

463
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,088
His bank account

464
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,392
Empty gas bank account

465
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,952
Spend

466
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:17,888
Simultaneously Alex's and a huge problem is Trump win

467
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,680
Oz personal situation

468
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:20,448
Doesn't it

469
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,216
Prove

470
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:27,360
How long can Alex argue that Trump is in a death battle with a very same globalist enemies

471
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,384
Against

472
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,920
Without Trump doing

473
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,968
Sing it all to help Alex

474
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:36,576
If they were actually allies in anything more than lip service level bulshit

475
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,368
You think the Trump would want to protect

476
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,136
Austin supported

477
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:42,208
Most public supporter of the only voice in the media who

478
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,232
He gets it

479
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,768
The board more Alex us

480
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,560
To pay the consequences for his actions

481
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,608
And the longer it goes where Trump doesn't

482
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,144
Give a f*** about Alex

483
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:59,616
Who he'd hoped would help him Advance his own personal interest

484
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:02,944
And it has not gone that way Alex

485
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,224
Is going to have

486
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:04,992
2

487
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,272
Fall on his sword

488
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,296
Play the Martyr

489
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:09,856
It doesn't seem like there's a dumbo

490
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:12,416
Well I honestly Alex

491
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:14,976
It's kind of realize

492
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:18,816
But unless something very specific happen

493
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:19,840
His date

494
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:23,424
Anything like that

495
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,752
But doesn't serve any purpose

496
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,824
Because he's become so entwined with Trump

497
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,640
Escalate escalate

498
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:35,968
He can't receive

499
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:36,992
He kick given

500
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,528
Because the

501
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:44,928
His Alex gives an inch it's not him just trying to moderate

502
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,208
Stream or be

503
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,768
Ground to literal demons

504
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:49,536
Child murder

505
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,840
And that's a bad position to be in

506
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,120
Any negotiation

507
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:59,520
Any compromise is compromise with the devil you can't compromise with the Devil

508
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,568
The only

509
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,848
Illiana song

510
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,664
The only two positive outcomes for Alex right now

511
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:12,320
Harper Trump to become an authoritarian ruler

512
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:14,624
And ruthlessly suppress and depress

513
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,392
Or

514
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:17,184
Trump loses a of Civil War

515
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:20,000
Pisan any form is not a marketable option

516
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:24,096
For Alex anymore he is too far gone

517
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:26,144
Last year when we were talking about like

518
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,472
What is it going to do what is going to take for him to Pivot away from Trump

519
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:35,872
How could those days are gone

520
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:38,688
Audience city has in the revenue stream that is

521
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:39,456
Become

522
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,992
Universo

523
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:41,760
Crucial

524
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:43,808
Now you can

525
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,600
I really I don't

526
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,136
I think I think it's

527
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,160
Possible

528
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:48,928
The Heat

529
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:50,976
I could but it would be one of the hardest

530
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:53,024
Maneuvers ever

531
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:57,376
It would require going to

532
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:00,192
Advocate

533
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:03,264
Yeah but he would have to turn on the government

534
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,544
Such a hard way

535
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:18,624
Create a narrative

536
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:21,696
Spin the narrative

537
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:23,232
And all

538
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:27,328
And the The Logical conclusion to his audience

539
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,376
Would be

540
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:33,472
And that would be the Civil War option

541
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:34,752
In terms of him being able to

542
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:35,520
Retain his place

543
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:37,312
The market

544
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,152
Rather have qanon people around him

545
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:43,712
To get Lionel come to the f****** White House

546
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:48,064
As long as he's got foxandfriends he'll be free

547
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,856
Account

548
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:52,416
But I refuse

549
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,464
Into any of truck

550
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:56,000
I refuse

551
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,024
On principle

552
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,816
He's giving away more public

553
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:01,632
Absolute appreciation to that

554
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,656
Then I Alex

555
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:05,728
In the optic Salvador tarab

556
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:09,568
Eclipse like that last one to ask Taco Bell

557
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,848
If Trump doesn't win

558
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:15,712
I can't help but think about how much better Alex's life would have been

559
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,736
Straub

560
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,784
Like you could have maintained his imagine

561
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,064
The guy was above

562
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,344
Partisan politics

563
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:22,368
Honestly

564
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,464
Someone with his talent offering a criticism

565
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,488
Trump from

566
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,792
Will probably be a very marketable thing and

567
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:32,096
Environment

568
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:36,960
Even in 2016 2017 2018

569
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:38,240
Someone with the gift

570
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:40,544
That Alex has just in terms of

571
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,312
Computer tower

572
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:46,176
Ignore the other terrible things about him

573
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,968
If he was offering a right-wing

574
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:54,368
Critique make better job trying to push it into the mainstream

575
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:58,464
Try to pull off

576
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,048
Like a lot of people really tried to help

577
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:04,864
You're right and he's so much

578
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,144
Better at

579
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,168
Being a liar

580
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:10,496
I think he's not nearly I mean

581
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:11,264
Embarrassing

582
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,288
He's not like

583
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,336
Just any pure competent

584
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,360
Lago Vista

585
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:16,128
Glenn Beck

586
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:18,688
So much money

587
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:19,712
In that space

588
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,504
Like you could have

589
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,272
You could have gotten

590
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,576
Less people over to side again

591
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:25,856
He could have done

592
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:27,136
I like all that s***

593
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:29,184
They use do during the Ron Paul time

594
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:34,048
Actually I think maybe you could have

595
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,840
But my guess is

596
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:38,912
He did not want to find out he doesn't want to find out

597
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,728
His audience loves him more than

598
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,520
For Trump more than him

599
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:48,896
That's a dangerous that's a dangerous what if you've never gotten on board with him

600
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,176
I've been against

601
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,456
It would have been perfect

602
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:54,528
Because he could have retained the audience that he had

603
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,832
Built in a different direction

604
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,624
That was much more on brand

605
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:01,696
The counter to the power

606
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,744
It would have been like

607
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,536
So reinforcing of everything

608
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:12,448
You have a

609
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:16,800
On the orb and he said I'm a globalist

610
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:22,176
There were so many new stories that have come out in every single thing that falls in line

611
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:25,760
All of Alex's old narratives

612
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,040
Posse Comitatus

613
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,344
He could have made so much money off

614
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:31,648
Banking

615
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:34,720
You think about it if you don't like it

616
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,024
It sucks that

617
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,560
He's so awful

618
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:41,120
Now Eric is really awful pile of s***

619
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:43,936
But you can take some comfort in knowing that

620
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,800
He's only such an awful pile of s*** right now because he's dealing with the worst decision

621
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:49,568
Movies ever made

622
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,104
A spiraling the drain

623
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,920
Cold comfort

624
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,968
Like Vicki could have gone

625
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:57,504
Flown under the radar

626
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,272
With all of this

627
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:00,064
Awful white nationalist

628
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:06,464
Stream

629
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,000
If he hadn't made the

630
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,024
This decision

631
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,584
So now it's our great

632
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,376
It is the the truth it

633
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,912
Racism

634
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,448
Bad for you as well

635
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,008
Do you know the people who voted for Trump

636
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,800
Solely

637
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,080
White power

638
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:22,848
Butterfly

639
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:23,872
Which is most

640
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:29,248
They're the ones who are also being f***** over Trump policy

641
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,344
Creasing

642
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:42,816
Just internally they're not happy

643
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,120
Yeah

644
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,400
Speaking of Rage

645
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,472
Machine member

646
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:51,776
I was going to try

647
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:59,712
Kylie cosmetics

648
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:02,784
Former Rage Against the Machine

649
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:07,136
I don't care about Donny Deutsch

650
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:09,184
Enjoy

651
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:13,792
The only reason I left the clipping is cuz Alex is mad at.

652
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,376
Sierra Vista

653
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,656
Is

654
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:21,216
It just seems like Alex is talking about himself

655
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:21,984
Okay

656
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,032
I love Donny Deutsch

657
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,848
What a pump

658
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:35,808
Their 100,000 viewers

659
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,416

Hillary lost a shadowban

663
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,888
Because you can't

664
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:52,192
No one wants to watch you.

665
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:55,264
Diaries

666
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,800
The few minutes

667
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:07,808
There is just such a crystallization of absolute

668
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,440
Brainwashed weirdos who believe you're stupid

669
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:19,840
Yep and people who tuned in order to help argue to argue with people online

670
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,888
That's

671
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:26,752
Alex is probably less useful that second category

672
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:29,312
But you definitely like you know that that's what it shows

673
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,336
Used for

674
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:34,432
Listen to calls that were specifically hey Alex

675
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:39,808
What should I say

676
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,136
So Alex gets back now to the Instagram

677
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:43,904
Narrative

678
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:49,536
Important because he's really saying 200 billion people

679
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,840
They've been cheating all along

680
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:54,144
And now Google all of them are

681
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,936
200 million

682
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:58,496
Facebook and Instagram

683
00:36:59,008 --> 00:36:59,776
Support the president

684
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:12,576
Like what

685
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:17,440
I was born on Friday

686
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:22,304

Open calculator

689
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:42,272
You have the roller paper

690
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:48,672
Please use I just feels like I just a picture a desk with a

691
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:58,144
200 million

692
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:04,544
Yeah. I want to watch that

693
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:06,848
Viral

694
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,640
So he's just making

695
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,408
That's just

696
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:11,200
200 billion

697
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:13,504
It would take more than a half-hour

698
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:22,464
This is just what calculators to I guess Eddie's

699
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:26,304
Another

700
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,328
Interesting

701
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,656

Everywhere the Democrats

Control

707
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,712
People are losing

708
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,016
There

709
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,832
Student Loan financial aid

710
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,136
Because the unions and the lawyers

Prosperous area

712

His collapse

724
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:36,960
You can tell by the way

725
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:37,984
Really

726

Taking long pauses music I don't know I don't know what's happening

California

731
00:39:58,976 --> 00:39:59,488
What is meddling

732
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:06,656
These damn liberals and Julian California

733
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:12,032
Sound like that honestly I have no idea why I care about us

734
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:13,568
The blue States

735
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,360
Liberal brainwashing Center

736
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:29,184
Never underestimate how much he and his intellectual

737
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:36,352
Opportunity possible to Moline labor

738
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:40,192
Right out the womb he was like

739
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:42,240
Socrum from his first breath

740
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:44,288
F*** labor

741
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:49,664
He's yelling that while his wife

742
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,248
Here's the first of the Myriad problems

743
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:02,464
It was the result of a federal rule from the Department of Education

744
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:08,864
Well it's actually

745
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,400
Percent

746
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:19,872
The regulation had to do with States being required to have a system in place for in-state residents who take classes remotely from out of

747
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:23,968
With the ruling

748
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:25,504
Place for dealing with

749
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,088
Concern then recipients of Federal student aid

750
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:30,368
Would lose access to

751
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,136
She said 8

752
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:33,184
It was a measure to protect students

753
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,792
They're absolutely consumer-protection related issues

754
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:38,816
Andreason's

755
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:40,096
For a rule like that

756
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:47,008
Naturally since Trump Administration

757
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:50,848
It didn't go into effect until July 1st 2018

758
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:51,872
Even then

759
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:58,271
Trump's people were trying to delay having to enforce it

760
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:04,159
Judge ruled postponed enforcing the rule any longer

761
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:10,047
So they started except 2019

762
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,839
There's like a week ago

763
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:15,423
The education secretary

764
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:23,103
How to blame because the National Education Association

765
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,151
Andy California Teachers Association

766
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:28,735
To get the rule implemented

767
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:30,527
California

768
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:32,063
The states most affected by this

769
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:39,487
Because they're the only state that's not part of the National Council for State authorization rep

770
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,255
Prosody

771
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:42,303
Sarah

772
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:44,863
Which basically is just a series of agreements

773
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:47,423
Recognize

774
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:53,055
California doesn't belong to that because they feel that the body does not offer strong enough

775
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:54,079
Consumer protection

776
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:59,199
Now they probably should have had something in place to deal with rule

777
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:01,759
Before Genesis lawsuit

778
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:08,415
But I think it a look at what's going on in the world and every reason to think that this world would never be implemented

779
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:10,463
And until it was they

780
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,743
Compliance with the rules

781
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:12,767
And they had

782
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:16,351
Place just up to that rule

783
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:22,751
Bigger issue is that as soon as California learned that there was enforceable to California.

784
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:25,567
Department of Consumer Affairs

785
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,895
So they met all the requirements of the regulation

786
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:35,039
And just like that all of the students who were at risk of losing their financial aid work no longer risk of losing their financial aid

787
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:39,903
By the time I was already

788
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:41,439
He's misrepresenting the

789
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:44,255
The story that the students lost their financial aid

790
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:49,887
When they were only at risk of losing it if California wasn't complaint with a Federal Regulation

791
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:54,751
He's lying about the union involvement in the situation

792
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,287
Does roll put simply

793
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,567
Alex

794
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:59,103
Really lazy dude

795
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:02,431
Who's on are misrepresenting already outdated

796
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:05,247
Just to make it look like unions are bad and blue states are

797
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:08,063
He's a loser

798
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:12,671
Yeah it's real serious literature

799
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:14,975
What's the f****** cares about

800
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:17,791
Financial aid go to college

801
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:18,559
What the f***

802
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:19,583
Even try to pretend

803
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:24,703
Go fly a kite with her

804
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:28,031
That Loan program.

805
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:34,943
Doing something in their life

806
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:39,295
You will receive zero consequences other than you

807
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,599
Successfully delayed this rule 42 bucket

808
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:44,415
Everybody had every reason

809
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:46,463
To assume that they were going to

810
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,999
Create more legal hurdles

811
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:48,767
Or

812
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:51,839
Just make it so

813
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:52,863
Exactly

814
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:53,887
Yeah it's there

815
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:56,447
Chaotic environment that Trump in his administration

816
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:57,727
Creating around

817
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:58,495
Types of fish

818
00:44:59,007 --> 00:44:59,775
SO2

819
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:00,543
Then

820
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:02,335
Turn around and blame

821
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:05,919
Somebody for not following the rule that the federal government

822
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:10,527
Is it a federal rule

823
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:12,831
I know that you should follow rules

824
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:17,183
Yeah but you're also creating an environment where no one knows what rules are real

825
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,207
And no one knows

826
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:22,815
What rules to follow its absolute

827
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,399
Because

828
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:29,471
It's the same thing as what we were talking about earlier

829
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,751
It's just too much

830
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:32,799
Travel to sue somebody

831
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:33,567
Not enough

832
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:36,639
Is if Trump just stopped

833
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:38,943
Following all of these rules

834
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:43,551
Nobody knows which ones to put their energy into

835
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:47,903
So you can see every possible

836
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:48,927
Enforce

837
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:50,207
Is the Hallmark

838
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:51,999
Of sort of autocratic

839
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:57,375
Because then you create the environment

840
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:00,191
And targeted enforcement is bigger

841
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:03,775
So

842
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:06,847
The Weeknd

843
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:09,407
There was a little bit of a dust-up

844
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:11,711
Donald Trump

845
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:12,991
And Elijah Cummings

846
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:17,599
So

847
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:19,135
Cummings comments

848
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:20,671
Director

849
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:21,695
About

850
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:22,719
Situation in

851
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:25,279
Rivalry

852
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:26,559
Refugees

853
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:30,655
And

854
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:32,447
Called

855
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,727
Baltimore

856
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:38,847
Rat infested

857
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:40,895
Yeah

858
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:42,431
Appreciate that so much

859
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:44,735
Clearly races

860
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:46,527
Coded language

861
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:47,807
That was you

862
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,855
Yeah

863
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:57,023
Don't get it I get it I think they make it

864
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:59,839
It is nice now

865
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:03,679
Disregard anything that anybody

866
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:04,447
Copc

867
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:05,983
You're all Races

868
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:12,639
Do you prioritize things

869
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:14,431
That

870
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:15,967
You diss prioritize

871
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:21,855
Your priorities are such

872
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,159
Take

873
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:25,951
Higher priority than

874
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:41,311
Alex response to this appealing to that video that we discussed on episode

875
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,591
Where he created

876
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:44,639
Completely artificial appearance

877
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:46,687
Combining

878
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:48,479
Candace Owens video from

879
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:50,015
Are you workout

880
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:53,599
Right

881
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:54,623
Specifically created

882
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:55,647
Keep kids

883
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,927
Out of

884
00:47:57,951 --> 00:48:02,815
Airport

885
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:03,583
Appearance

886
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,863
Of what these eyes

887
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:08,447
Centers were like

888
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:14,079
To be like this world alive coming to talkin about so then he gets past that hurdle

889
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:24,063
Elijah Cummings

890
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,415
Instead of really dressing

891
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:30,719
To do is make fun of Victor Blackwell

892
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:35,839
The CNN anchor who broke down

893
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:37,119
While discussing

894
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:38,399
How he

895
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:39,423
Experience

896
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:41,471
Tweeting about Elijah Cummings

897
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:50,943
Mockingjay

898
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:52,735
Is that

899
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:54,015
Show

900
00:48:54,271 --> 00:49:00,415
Lack of humanity that Alex's show

901
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:02,975
But I wanted to really drive home

902
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:05,023
Is really making a meal

903
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:07,071
Is making fun of

904
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,095
This

905
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:08,863
Anchor

906
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,399
Having an emotional reaction

907
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:11,423
Trump

908
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,191
Using

909
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:15,775
Dehumanizing language consistently towards non-white

910
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:28,063
Whatever the hell you are

911
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:33,951
But it gets worse

912
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:37,023
Victor Blackwell

913
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:38,303
Hypertrophic reps

914
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:40,095
Infested Baltimore

915
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:50,591
So you see already what he's doing is he's created the false appearance of the conversation

916
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,199
Cold black

917
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:58,271
Is not what people are responding

918
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:01,087
So he's already shifted the goalposts

919
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:04,415
Distraught man for himself to talk about

920
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:07,231
Here is some more of this

921
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:09,023
This is disgraceful

922
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:16,191
There's a Revolution going on in California so many Sanctuary areas

923
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:19,263
Want out of this ridiculous

924
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:20,799
And breeding concept

925
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:22,335
Infested he says

926
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:25,919
So real quick before we get to Alex's response

927
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:28,735
I think it's really important to point out that the

928
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:31,551
The part of Victor Blackwell

929
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:34,367
Opposed

930
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:36,159
Got pretty popular on

931
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:41,023
Import

932
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:42,047
Contacts

933
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:45,119
Alex is cutting out of the beginning of this clip

934
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,423
Is he's explaining that

935
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:50,495
Secure the presidents of the United States

936
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:51,519
Distantly.

937
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:53,567
Dehumanizing language about non-white people

938
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,615
He points out in this

939
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:04,575
A discussion of that in all of Trumps

940
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:06,111
43000 tweets

941
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:09,695
He only uses the word infested to describe

942
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:15,071
Predominately legislators that he

943
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:17,375
Instances of white

944
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:18,655
Legislator

945
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:19,679
That he is

946
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:21,215
Got Netflix

947
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:23,007
Use that same

948
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,031
When he does

949
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:26,847
So that is the conversation that is what

950
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:27,871
Victor Blackwell

951
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:29,151
Is about

952
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:31,967
I was deprived of the context

953
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:34,271
In order to make fun of Justice

954
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,039
The fact

955
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:36,575
Victor Blackwell

956
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:38,879
Which is really good

957
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:42,207
The President says about Congressman Cummings District

958
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:52,703
Watch your show

959
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:56,287
No human

960
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:58,335
You know who did mr. president I did

961
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:03,199
Home from the hospital

962
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,015
This is mind control

963
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:08,575
Trying to stay clean it up help

964
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:14,207
No human should have to live there it's not good

965
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:16,767
Truth

966
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:27,775
Don't you

967
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:41,855
Blackwell

968
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:45,439
Obviously there are endemic problems

969
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:46,975
And systemic problems

970
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:47,999
Send

971
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:49,279
Baltimore there are

972
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:53,119
You know it's far more complicated than I would be able to explain

973
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:54,655
To anybody

974
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:57,215
You can't just watch The Wire

975
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:58,751
Right

976
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:01,823
Where's over-simplification that Alex is doing

977
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,103
Gyros

978
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:03,871
Disgusting

979
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:05,663
Very shity

980
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:10,783
Expression

981
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:12,575
That one person

982
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:13,599
Can't do any

983
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:19,999
Represent this area

984
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:21,791
And if he doesn't fix it

985
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:27,679
You must be profiting off not fixing it he must want it to be this way

986
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:30,239
Which isn't necessarily good

987
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:37,151
No it's absolutely impossible for these people to understand

988
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:40,479
Yeah and the way that if you pull one lever here

989
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:42,271
It will change something

990
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:49,951
Corruption involving I probably could probably

991
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:52,511
Almost

992
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:56,095
Are there better strategy maybe should be explored

993
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:58,655
Possibly

994
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:01,727
People who care

995
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:04,543
Alex and Trump

996
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:05,311
Or not

997
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:07,871
Sickness next day we get back here

998
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:08,639
To Alex

999
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:09,919
Making fun of

1000
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:12,735
Victor Blackwell

1001
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:14,015
It's pretty gross

1002
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:17,087
Home from the hospital

1003
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:22,975
There a challenge

1004
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:24,511
No Doubt

1005
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:33,727
I want to hear what you gave mama

1006
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:37,311
Slaughterhouse you got a car

1007
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:46,015
Have no idea what he's talking about

1008
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:51,135
What do you know about his personal would you know anyting

1009
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:54,207
Absolutely

1010
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:58,047
I don't know it

1011
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:11,615
Blackwell did this for his community I'll look back

1012
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:17,759
There's no it's a losing game to even Explore a

1013
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:21,087
It's just worthwhile pointing out that Alex

1014
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:23,391
So here's the last

1015
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:25,695
Start back

1016
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:34,143
What people get up and go to work

1017
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:36,447
Be careful that families there

1018
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:52,319
Stuff like this is indicative of

1019
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:53,599
Things that are threatened

1020
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:56,159
Dude

1021
00:55:56,415 --> 00:56:01,023
Constant repetition going back and go over it and

1022
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:05,375
Behavior that Alex employees

1023
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:07,167
Towards things that are

1024
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:13,567
Pretty prevalent like there's no denying that this clip went all over the place

1025
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,639
Would have access

1026
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:18,431
Steward they might come in contact

1027
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:22,783
It's making an argument that is

1028
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:25,087
Because it does

1029
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:27,903
Let me know

1030
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:29,695
Discuss

1031
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:31,743
Victor Blackwell

1032
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:34,303
The idea that Trump uses

1033
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,095
Language

1034
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:42,239
Specifically in situations

1035
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:43,263
It is

1036
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:47,103
To hear it something has an effect

1037
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,895
On people

1038
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:52,735
If that were allowed to be seen

1039
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:55,039
Perspective

1040
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:58,879
It runs the risk of opening up his audience's eyes

1041
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:00,671
Too empathic position

1042
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:01,439
And understand

1043
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:02,719
How other people

1044
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:05,535
Is dangerous

1045
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:08,607
Daddy

1046
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:10,911
That's even though a large number of his audience

1047
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:11,679
Intuit actually be

1048
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:20,383
There's a crucial distinction

1049
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:22,431
Later on at 10 episodes

1050
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:23,711
Leave on the Monday episode

1051
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:25,759
He plays a clip of Marianne Williamson

1052
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:28,575
How hosting a apology

1053
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:33,439
Where

1054
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:36,767
He. He doesn't need to box

1055
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:37,791
Because

1056
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:38,815
Is creative

1057
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:41,631
An environment where it looks like an absurd

1058
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:44,703
So he can just play

1059
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:47,263
Alex

1060
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:48,031
Uses

1061
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:49,311
Other media

1062
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:50,079
And it's important

1063
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,871
Understand this strategy

1064
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:52,895
Employed

1065
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:54,175
When something is a

1066
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:56,991
I believe it

1067
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:01,599
To the woodshed

1068
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:02,623
Because of this

1069
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:03,647
Cheshire

1070
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:06,975
All right here we go

1071
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:11,071
Easy as a pre-recorded

1072
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:13,119
Message to the present

1073
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:16,447
You're committing suicide

1074
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:17,215
If you don't

1075
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:19,775
All right how beautiful

1076
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:21,823
This is

1077
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:24,383
I would describe this is very embarrassing

1078
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:26,687
Like the idea

1079
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:29,759
First of all he thinks he's talking directly to the president

1080
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:30,527
Crazy

1081
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:32,575
If he thinks he's talking

1082
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:33,343
The president

1083
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:35,135
He has to think that the president is

1084
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:36,415
Stupid is one of his listener

1085
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:42,559
Exercise

1086
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:43,327
An embarrassment

1087
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:45,375
Admit

1088
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:51,007
Memes are more powerful than

1089
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:52,031
Combined

1090
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:54,079
America

1091
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:03,295
Criticizing

1092
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:04,831
Has greenlit

1093
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:05,599
The Purge

1094
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:09,951
This is your distribution

1095
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:11,231
24-hours

1096
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:12,255
Your speeches

1097
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:19,679
And they're just being annihilator

1098
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:27,615
Season plying this 200 million accounts

1099
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:28,639
Trumpets as

1100
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:32,991
3 million illegal immigrants vote in the

1101
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:36,831
Clear like he's making it

1102
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:43,231
So this is your distribution Network where your truth literally almost

1103
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:50,143
Right right you're not going to get rid of

1104
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:53,215
I understand but I'm gone

1105
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:55,775
From social media

1106
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:56,799
Youth

1107
00:59:57,055 --> 01:00:02,943
And I'm still making a profit

1108
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:06,271
Area of the market no one's going to nudge me from that right

1109
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:09,599
I am in trouble if you lose

1110
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:11,135
Mybranch

1111
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:12,159
Right

1112
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:18,559
If you don't have a ton of

1113
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:24,959
Everybody with

1114
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:26,239
My business is gone

1115
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:27,007
Trump

1116
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:28,287
Program

1117
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:32,383
He's fundamental correct

1118
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:35,711
Lorraine's daycare

1119
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:40,319
Cedar planks

1120
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:47,231
Circle circle

1121
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:51,327
Everybody

1122
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:53,631
This is my cousin

1123
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:56,703
Dog fur

1124
01:00:57,471 --> 01:01:00,287
Behind all of this

1125
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:01,823
This is like

1126
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,359
It's so overt

1127
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:05,151
The the the sort of

1128
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:07,199
The motivations behind

1129
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:08,735
It's just so much alike

1130
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:11,039
In the state were in I'm sucked

1131
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:12,063
If you go down

1132
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:13,087
And

1133
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:14,623
You need

1134
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:16,927
These dudes you need these crazy dudes

1135
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:22,047
You need you need to these Liars pay-per-view keep on this path

1136
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:32,287
And I don't want right thinking that I don't want

1137
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:36,895
Don't make me do it over it's a hard pit

1138
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:40,479
Chef

1139
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:43,295
I've been slow playing him for a long time

1140
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:44,831
But here we are

1141
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:47,903
So does next still from his address

1142
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:50,207
President he just implied

1143
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:51,231
Again

1144
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:52,511
200

1145
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:53,535
People gone again

1146
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:55,071
Open and Ludacris

1147
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:57,631
Get on and off every few hours

1148
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:03,007
Dawn Dawn

1149
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:09,407
Talk about

1150
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:11,199
This is election meddling

1151
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:16,575
People following Democrats eyes

1152
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:18,879
News organizations

1153
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:22,207
Delete it in a coordinated fashion

1154
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:23,999
There would be an outcry

1155
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:30,143
Really hate it whenever

1156
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:32,959
Alabama and Georgia

1157
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:34,239
Boats from the roll

1158
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,031
I don't think he cares

1159
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:42,943
Consolidate dead people

1160
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:45,759
Like

1161
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:48,831
There aren't any high-profile Democrats

1162
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:50,623
Your life cleaning people who haven't been

1163
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:55,231
Like demonetized on YouTube or kicked off Facebook or Twitter

1164
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:57,279
It's absurd it's just most of them were like

1165
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:01,119
That sucks

1166
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:11,359
Is a shity free-speech Crusades go on

1167
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:13,919
So in this next

1168
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:16,223
Cliff Alex

1169
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:20,831
Trump doesn't get on board something

1170
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:27,487
Location

1171
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:32,607
Oh boy

1172
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:39,007
Did you

1173
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:42,847
Could you sit there and let these

1174
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:56,159
Makes me

1175
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:59,487
So I mean probably means nothing

1176
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:00,767
Sternly worded letter

1177
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:05,631
I mean it

1178
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:07,167
I don't know

1179
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:12,287
I don't know what to do

1180
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:21,247
Potential of danger in the vague notion of Alex's audien

1181
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:25,087
I don't

1182
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:26,879
Like it's funny because he's

1183
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:28,671
Personally an impetus

1184
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:29,439
Enforce

1185
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:32,255
He has the potential to inspire in people

1186
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:33,023
To do

1187
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:34,815
Negative

1188
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:38,399
Like he has nothing left

1189
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:40,959
Like this Trump has abandoned

1190
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:42,751
I could see it.

1191
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:43,775
Realself

1192
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:53,247
It's always funny

1193
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:54,527
Because this is about memes

1194
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:59,647
You really have a hard time believing that we live in a world memes

1195
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,815
Laughable on one level but it also has the sword

1196
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:08,351
Thing where you got to you got to recognize

1197
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:12,191
If he all the sudden

1198
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:16,287
If it weren't for that

1199
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:22,175
Perform through

1200
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:25,759
So Alex Adams

1201
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:27,295
Address to the Press

1202
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:29,599
I want I need to be clear

1203
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:31,391
This is an address to the Press

1204
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:32,671
Keeps

1205
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:34,463
Mr. President Trump

1206
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:35,999
Direct

1207
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:45,471
Sage Walker support

1208
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:48,799
He thanks the audience for their support

1209
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:52,383
Thank you all for your support

1210
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:53,151
Yeah

1211
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:54,175
Okay

1212
01:05:54,431 --> 01:06:00,575
Using leading up to an ad pivot that doesn't come at the end of his address to the president

1213
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:06,975
Interesting

1214
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:13,375
Mr. president

1215
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:19,775
Don't take Superman will never get back on Facebook I mean it's not really

1216
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:22,079
Because he does this

1217
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:28,479
Is it performative

1218
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:34,367
From commercial and here's what's going on

1219
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:37,951
Keep this operation going

1220
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:39,743
I forget to remind viewers

1221
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:44,351
Find it

1222
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:47,679
Proposed infowars.com

1223
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:55,871
Presentation

1224
01:06:58,175 --> 01:06:58,943
First to do for our body

1225
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:02,527
Tomorrow

1226
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:03,807
11 a.m. Central

1227
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:12,255
So he had a tape recorded introduction to a pre-recorded infomercial about iodine

1228
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:15,583
I don't know jujitsu

1229
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:18,143
Explain

1230
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:23,263
His show on Sunday

1231
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:27,615
Substantial Sunday show than many I've heard

1232
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:30,943
Or maybe he's important

1233
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:31,967
Once again

1234
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:33,759
And Monday

1235
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:36,063
Instagram narrative

1236
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:37,343
My friend

1237
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:41,439
It's it spiraled

1238
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:47,839
Pouring in Instagram

1239
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:52,959
Did they see your Christian they're coming

1240
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:56,543
Scare other Christian Americans

1241
01:07:58,591 --> 01:08:01,663
Stop talking about Jesus

1242
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:09,599
I don't know about that

1243
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:14,207
I'm certain it's not because of

1244
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:18,815
American flags or Christians

1245
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:20,095
Huh

1246
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:31,359
Nope otherwise

1247
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:33,151
Look at already.

1248
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:39,551
The 200 million people getting kicked off

1249
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:45,951
My family members are calling me

1250
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:47,999
Assume that this garnish is a light

1251
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:48,767
I don't know

1252
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:53,887
We get the introduction of

1253
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:55,423
He's going to show up later

1254
01:08:58,239 --> 01:08:58,751
Trevor Bauer

1255
01:08:59,007 --> 01:08:59,519
No

1256
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:03,103
Retired state police officer

1257
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:05,151
That is brother's friend of the show

1258
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:05,919
Joe Bannister

1259
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:10,015
We'll be popping in at the bottom

1260
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:14,623
He will be getting the inside scoop

1261
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:17,439
Festival

1262
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:20,511
Where several people were shot and killed

1263
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:24,863
Free zone

1264
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:31,263
SoJO Spa

1265
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:32,031
4 years

1266
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:39,455
Alex says that he ran security for it I can't

1267
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:42,527
Confirm that I'm not really all that interested

1268
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:45,599
When we get to his actual interview he's got nothing to say

1269
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:48,927
So

1270
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:50,975
Legitimately

1271
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:53,535
Expert analysis

1272
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:55,327
Webcops

1273
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:56,863
Search the guy's house like

1274
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:59,679
Nothing

1275
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:04,031
Delivering publicly available information with the authority of a

1276
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:04,799
Retired cop

1277
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:06,591
Help Alex

1278
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:10,175
I guess he's related to Joe f****** Bana

1279
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:11,967
Brit

1280
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:16,063
Another one that Alex is covering over this time

1281
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:19,647
Spend at the Goodwill

1282
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:22,719
The Director of National Intelligence

1283
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:23,743
Two-stepping

1284
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:27,071
John Ratcliffe

1285
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:29,119
To be his replacement

1286
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:31,935
Noted GPS John rep Alex is

1287
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:32,703
Thrilled with it

1288
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:34,239
Pretty funny

1289
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:36,799
Here's a clip of him being thrilled

1290
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:39,871
Ridiculous on the other end

1291
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:41,407
I've already gotten into

1292
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:44,223
The record

1293
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:55,743
That's bending

1294
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:57,791
Alarm Bells

1295
01:10:58,303 --> 01:11:02,143
Might not be the best example of

1296
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:03,167
He's very supportive.

1297
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:05,471
And it's hilarious how Cravens

1298
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:07,775
Spineless and full of s*** Alex Jones is

1299
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:13,919
If you need me example of a f*** about anything for look no further than his

1300
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:17,247
Support of Trump's nomination of John Ratcliffe as his director of Nash

1301
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:18,015
Intelligence

1302
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:22,879
John Ratcliffe is not qualified at all for the position of piano

1303
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:25,439
He was the mayor of Heath Texas population

1304
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:27,487
Approximately 6,000 48

1305
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:31,839
During that time George W bush appointed for the eastern district

1306
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:34,143
Texas possession he was mysteriously

1307
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:36,447
Here before returning to public life

1308
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:40,287
In 2014 be primary the sitting Republican in Texas

1309
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:42,079
4th District in the House of Representative

1310
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:44,127
He was running against Stacey

1311
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:50,527
Who was 91 years old at that time

1312
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:53,599
When ralphel inter-government in the Texas Senate

1313
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:55,391
JFK was still alive

1314
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:58,463
This was an old old man

1315
01:11:58,975 --> 01:12:03,583
You could make your campaign slogan he's 91 probably win

1316
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:09,983
So breakfast still only ended up with

1317
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:16,127
With a narrow margin in the primary democratic

1318
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:17,663
So you want to see in Congress

1319
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:21,759
2016 Democratic candidates

1320
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:25,599
The position of DNA is a non-partisan

1321
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:26,367
Positions

1322
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:32,511
It's very important that the person who occupies that position not be someone who's invested in Party politics

1323
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:34,559
Because should that person in charge of

1324
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:35,839
All the country's intelligence

1325
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:36,607
Agencies

1326
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:38,911
Be someone to hold into a political party

1327
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:43,263
You can imagine the sort of things they could do to help their political party of choice

1328
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:45,311
No I mean

1329
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:47,615
Can you imagine somebody abusing their power

1330
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:51,711
Previous to Trump being elected no one who occupied this position

1331
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:53,759
Came from a background as a member of Congress

1332
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:56,831
These are career diplomats or intelligence profession

1333
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:01,183
Who had 60 years

1334
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:02,975
Career as a Republican

1335
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:06,815
As well as an eight-year career in the House of Representatives

1336
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:10,655
The politicization of this position is exceedingly dangerous

1337
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:12,959
And you know we're seeing that happen

1338
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:19,359
Even if there were a presumption of impartiality to it our intelligence Community is a dangerous thing to have exist

1339
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:22,687
Partisan politics

1340
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:23,711
People real trouble

1341
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:26,527
It's definitely

1342
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:28,575
Okay so what you're saying

1343
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:29,343
Is that

1344
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:31,135
Were we to have a

1345
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:32,671
Partisan director of mash

1346
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:34,207
Somebody who

1347
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:35,487
Can direct

1348
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:36,767
Intelligent

1349
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:38,559
To do things

1350
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:45,215
Are beholding to a hard right Republican lunatic

1351
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:47,007
Thinks that everybody's out to

1352
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:47,775
Him

1353
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:49,055
And wants to use until

1354
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:50,591
To further his own

1355
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:52,639
You think him a point

1356
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:54,943
Is a bad idea

1357
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:57,503
Responsibility

1358
01:13:58,015 --> 01:14:01,599
It's also worth pointing out the John Radcliffe as a hundred percent

1359
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:03,391
Conservative score from Heritage action

1360
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:05,183
And ranks as one of the most

1361
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:07,231
Conservative members in all of Congo

1362
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:08,767
He just yelled at Mueller

1363
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:12,351
He was on the shortlist for Trump

1364
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:14,399
Attorney General

1365
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:16,447
Even though

1366
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:17,471
He's a team

1367
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:18,751
Give me some context

1368
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:20,543
Text Ted Cruz

1369
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:21,567
Score

1370
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:23,359
Louie gohmert

1371
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:25,663
Score

1372
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:27,199
Ratcliff is Bork

1373
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:33,855
I've literally zero faith that you'll be able to separate it for little leading from the job of being

1374
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:35,647
But I also think that's why

1375
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:38,463
All that should have disqualified

1376
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:44,095
And here's something though

1377
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:44,863
Should Cara

1378
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:50,751
In 2009 Ratcliff became a partner at the law firm of Ashcroft Sutton Ratcliffe

1379
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:54,847
None other than

1380
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:59,199
George W Bush's attorney general 9/11

1381
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:02,527
Radcliffe is involved in the Bush Administration

1382
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:08,415
Then afterwards became Partners in a law firm

1383
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:15,071
Endorsing this guy to lead all the countries is essentially Alex

1384
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:16,095
All the stuff he used to say

1385
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:18,655
This is seriously disqualifying stuff here

1386
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:22,495
Alma name trying to defend the nomination of a guy probably doesn't stand a chance

1387
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:23,775
Being approved by Congress

1388
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:29,151
Because already indications of the Republicans oxweld

1389
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:30,687
You really hate to see this

1390
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:37,599
Guy who was a partner in a law firm with John Ashcroft

1391
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:38,623
Alex

1392
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:41,951
Do you remember who you are

1393
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:48,607
You hate John Ashcroft only covered up the Democratic party of 9/11

1394
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:52,447
Conservatives

1395
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:53,471
Libertarian

1396
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:54,751
911

1397
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:56,031
I have no idea

1398
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:57,823
Stupid

1399
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:02,431
Another name piece of Alex's

1400
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:04,479
Narrative here on the 29th

1401
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:08,831
Which of course Alex

1402
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:10,111
Proceed to

1403
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:11,391
Carry out as

1404
01:16:12,415 --> 01:16:17,535
Black people are not great

1405
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:20,351
8

1406
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:22,655
Goes goes pretty hard

1407
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:25,727
I mean that stuff

1408
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:27,775
Pretty clear oh yeah it gets worse

1409
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:31,359
Ms Clipper about to listen to

1410
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:32,127
Dear Alex

1411
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:33,151
Who's making the argument

1412
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:37,759
Talks about people attack people

1413
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:41,599
People

1414
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:42,623
Which is the proper

1415
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:49,023
Videos

1416
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:54,655
And compilations and underground articles and local news stories by police

1417
01:16:57,983 --> 01:17:00,543
Where games of racist black people

1418
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:02,591
White people

1419
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:03,615
Young people

1420
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:06,431
Kill them

1421
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:16,415
They just lie

1422
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:19,487
Before Congress

1423
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:20,511
There's a lot of

1424
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:25,119
There's mountains

1425
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:26,655
Supremacist

1426
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:27,935
White nationalist

1427
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:29,215
Motivated

1428
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:36,383
Videos of black people beating up white people

1429
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:38,431
Text

1430
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:39,455
Sure it's

1431
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:43,039
Visceral

1432
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:49,439
Tons of racism

1433
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:51,231
Proof of anything

1434
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:52,255
It's not

1435
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:57,119
Good it didn't this is what he's relying

1436
01:17:57,375 --> 01:18:03,519
The Knockout game

1437
01:18:03,775 --> 01:18:04,543
Does have we had to

1438
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:08,127
Enough

1439
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:10,687
And none of them has come from

1440
01:18:11,455 --> 01:18:13,503
Alex

1441
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:15,295
Is still try to defend Trump

1442
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:17,855
Comments about Baltimore and I don't

1443
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:18,879
I don't know

1444
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:21,695
Murder Maps

1445
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:26,559
Murders a year in Baltimore

1446
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:30,143
Rivals

1447
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:32,191
By Chicago

1448
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:37,055
So the first thing we can tell hear from Alex

1449
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:40,639
The coverage of the whole Trump Elijah Cummings

1450
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:47,039
Homicide

1451
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:47,807
Cuz the book

1452
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:50,879
Yeah obviously there's very complicated situation

1453
01:18:57,279 --> 01:19:00,351
Explain all of it to you or even advocate for what the rights

1454
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:01,887
Solution is I'm not

1455
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:04,191
Outside of my Lane

1456
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:09,311
What I can tell you however is

1457
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:11,871
Politely to explain to Alex

1458
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:15,967
I'm going to give you a little bit of your own medicine

1459
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:22,623
President do that for you there are thousands of murders a year in Baltimore

1460
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:28,255
That number might be right about a place like Caracas or a couple cities in Brazil

1461
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:30,047
Consider is anywhere near that level

1462
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:30,815
Murder

1463
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:33,887
In 2017 there were 341 murders in bulk

1464
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:36,191
Alex doesn't care about reality

1465
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:37,215
He cares about

1466
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:39,519
Presentation of the narrative

1467
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:44,895
It sure looks like there were thousands of murders in that Lawless cities there are

1468
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:46,943
Alex this is shity work

1469
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:48,223
You need to do better

1470
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:50,527
Because these are just numbers their statistic

1471
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:54,367
You can even just talking about total murders

1472
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:55,903
Is it pointless

1473
01:19:56,415 --> 01:19:56,927
Statistics

1474
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:59,231
You got to talk about things in terms of rates

1475
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:03,583
And when you do you find 100,000

1476
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:06,655
The numbers become less meaningful

1477
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:07,935
Chicago and 27th

1478
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:10,239
Highest murder rate

1479
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:11,007
In the country

1480
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:14,592
Only two high-end just done

1481
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:16,128
But

1482
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:17,408
When you

1483
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:18,432
Chicago hits

1484
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:20,736
300 more murders in 27

1485
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:21,504
Tina Baltimore

1486
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:24,832
But the murderer was much lower

1487
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:26,112
Yeah why is that

1488
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:28,416
How do you integrate this into your conversation

1489
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:29,440
You can't

1490
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:33,024
Of course their burgers when there are more people

1491
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:39,168
Society

1492
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:44,544
This connection to Baltimore

1493
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:45,568
Hey.

1494
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:46,336
Chicago

1495
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:51,200
Booking by murder rate there's tons of red-state

1496
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:52,480
The number one is

1497
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:56,064
What is the highest murder rate

1498
01:20:56,320 --> 01:21:00,160
It doesn't matter this conversation blue-state red-state doesn't

1499
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:02,720
F****** matter but you can create the optic

1500
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:05,280
If you use statsportal it

1501
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:07,072
And that's all I was doing because

1502
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:08,864
He doesn't care about violence

1503
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:10,400
He cares about using

1504
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:11,168
2 attack

1505
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:13,728
The people of the other party

1506
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:17,824
Absolutely

1507
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:18,592
Not care about him

1508
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:19,360
Improving

1509
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:20,128
No

1510
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:21,408
Mainly because

1511
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:22,432
Still alive

1512
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:23,456
M2u

1513
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:27,296
So

1514
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:31,648
Lying about that are involved

1515
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:33,184
Ugly

1516
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:34,208
It sucks

1517
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,280
What's Bill Gates

1518
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:38,048
Yeah

1519
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:39,072
He's trying to

1520
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:43,936
Brainwashed brainwashed people against whites

1521
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:44,960
Sure

1522
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:47,520
Credible

1523
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:49,056
Level

1524
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:51,104
Washington

1525
01:21:58,272 --> 01:21:59,296
Foundation

1526
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,136
Finding Finance to buy

1527
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:03,904
Perfect

1528
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:14,400
WhatsApp

1529
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:20,032
Besides themselves

1530
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:23,360
Anybody else were funded by

1531
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:24,896
Buying products

1532
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:31,296
So first of all I'm excited to hear about brainwashing

1533
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:36,416
But also

1534
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:37,952
If this is true

1535
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:40,768
No not that part

1536
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:47,424
But if it's true that Alex has had all these people

1537
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:48,704
Just the American people

1538
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:54,592
Alex why are you fighting so hard to like make sure that they don't get access it

1539
01:22:54,848 --> 01:23:00,992
Why are you creating a milakovic

1540
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:04,064
Money does come from like a really sick

1541
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:09,696
Supplement sale in books and water filtration business

1542
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:12,512

I want to I want to congratulate you on a business well-run

1544
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:21,216
So secretive to the point

1545
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:24,032
People like your head of HR your father

1546
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:30,432
Other people I have no idea what the f***** going on why does no one know what your business

1547
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:33,760
Model is why is everyone

1548
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:34,528
If

1549
01:23:34,784 --> 01:23:35,552
It weren't

1550
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:37,088
Something Shady

1551
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:38,368

1552
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:39,136

You know he has he lives

1554
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:44,256
Lives in a countless resistance

1555
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:45,536
I believe is

1556
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:48,608
Who is it

1557
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:51,936
I've been

1558
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:54,752
You're Alex Chinaman on something

1559
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:55,520
WhatsApp

1560
01:23:56,288 --> 01:24:00,128
This size hole let's storm Area 51

1561
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:03,968
I'm not sure if you had I missed some days because of the move outside

1562
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:06,528
I heard him talk about it in the episode

1563
01:24:06,784 --> 01:24:11,648
He's got to have a take on that

1564
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:16,000
September

1565
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:19,584
Haven't

1566
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:20,864
I heard about that

1567
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:23,680
Leo zagami told me about that

1568
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:25,216
They were storming area

1569
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:29,056
Like this is something that Alex probably

1570
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:29,824
Is got to talk about

1571
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,616
First of all

1572
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:37,504
He should probably be thrilled at this cuz all it is is a joke

1573
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:40,320
I didn't know what

1574
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:42,112
Like how he was going to land on it

1575
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:44,416
And to say that I was surprised

1576
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:45,696
To hear his take on it

1577
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:46,464
For being understanding

1578
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:50,048
I've been watching this area 51 situation

1579
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:52,608
Original

1580
01:24:54,912 --> 01:24:56,192
3 weeks ago

1581
01:24:56,704 --> 01:25:00,544
I'm sure you have the same thoughts let me just explain something I'm sure you all know this

1582
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:05,408
Facebook page last year

1583
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:07,712

Everybody knows that you got to pee

1590
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:33,312
Unless you're just a private person I want

1591
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:40,224
Third Estate terms of service

1592
01:25:40,992 --> 01:25:44,832
I have a Facebook page about a podcast about how you're an idiot

1593
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:48,416
Yeah I paid a couple times like $5

1594
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:50,976
Experiment with a

1595
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:52,256
Not worth it

1596
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:57,632
Yeah I've ever put

1597
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:03,264
They have no I've never had

1598
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:05,056
Play running this out

1599
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:11,456

Because

1604
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:42,688
He is struggling what about the area 50

1605
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:46,272
He was right

1606
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:47,552
About 3 weeks ago

1607
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:50,368
As were most of you about Area 51

1608
01:26:50,624 --> 01:26:56,768
About Area 51 is got to pay to have a Facebook page

1609

Individual

1617
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:28,000
Storm

1618
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:28,768
Actually

1619
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:33,888

Storm a military base

1632
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:24,832
Question about the last and the CIA

1633
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:27,136
Show us Google

1634
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:29,696
They are 100%

1635
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:30,976
Running

1636
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:37,376
Conservative members of Congress

1637
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:38,656
Are not very interesting

1638
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:40,448
A joke

1639
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:44,288
Event like this

1640
01:28:44,544 --> 01:28:49,152
Pretty funny and people have done a lot of marketing for it on their own with little

1641
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:55,552
Videos and and that has led people

1642
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:57,088
2

1643
01:28:57,344 --> 01:28:58,112
Promote

1644
01:28:58,624 --> 01:29:00,416
Joke

1645
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:06,816
The CIA started it

1646
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:14,496
The alternative is absolutely the truth is this is a funny people liked it

1647
01:29:14,752 --> 01:29:20,896
People interested in a way that they're not in your b******* bigoted

1648
01:29:21,152 --> 01:29:24,736
Attentive that all these other shadowbanned Republicans

1649
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:26,016
F*** off

1650
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:29,600
Appealing to people in your not

1651
01:29:32,672 --> 01:29:34,976
Jumping in on this right

1652
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:38,304
Although they literally can't because his listeners

1653
01:29:38,816 --> 01:29:40,352
Would actually try and start

1654
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:51,616
That's troublesome

1655
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:58,528
I think that Alex would end up turning into Steven Kelly

1656
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:02,112
The Getty Museum

1657
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:09,280
Is back up later and I would play it now because then there would be

1658
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:12,352
There's another comment about Area 51

1659
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:14,400
Like an hour later in the show

1660
01:30:14,656 --> 01:30:20,800
I was thinking about this organized the episode

1661
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:26,176
Chronology what are the things I think is important is to

1662
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:28,736
Repetition

1663
01:30:29,248 --> 01:30:30,272
Of this show

1664
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:36,672
Repeatedly throughout the course of the show

1665
01:30:36,928 --> 01:30:37,696
What he does

1666
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:45,120
Back and forth from them in a way that's disorienting to your mind.

1667
01:30:45,376 --> 01:30:51,008
Remember this brought it up so there's already been cover

1668
01:30:51,264 --> 01:30:52,288
It's intentional.

1669
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:53,568
The strategy of

1670
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:55,616
Of never

1671
01:30:55,872 --> 01:30:56,384
Meeting Jeff

1672
01:30:56,896 --> 01:30:58,688
But still creating the appearance of

1673
01:30:59,456 --> 01:31:01,504
Through

1674
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:03,296
Westside

1675
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:05,600
Artificial familiarity

1676
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:06,368
I guess it's whatever

1677
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:10,464
Artificial turf similarity with the story

1678
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:11,744
Oh I know that

1679
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:12,768
Presenting

1680
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:14,816
Presenting an angle

1681
01:31:15,584 --> 01:31:16,864
Without any depth

1682
01:31:17,376 --> 01:31:17,888
And then

1683
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:20,192
Because you're bringing it up later

1684
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:22,240
Yeah now that makes sense

1685
01:31:25,312 --> 01:31:25,824
Intentional

1686
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,360
I think perhaps

1687
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:31,712
I think I think it is on some level

1688
01:31:31,968 --> 01:31:32,992
Because he couldn't do it the other

1689
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:37,600
He couldn't do a show where he actually got into the nuts and bolts

1690
01:31:37,856 --> 01:31:38,624
Do something

1691
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:42,208
Because it's like a show like ours

1692
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:48,608
Everything

1693
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:56,288
Hey guys sorry about this this headline looked good

1694
01:31:56,544 --> 01:31:58,848
F***

1695
01:31:59,104 --> 01:32:01,664
Arden

1696
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,456
Fans of Alex Jones

1697
01:32:03,712 --> 01:32:09,600
Call Safelite

1698
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:16,000
I might have tried to write the show like that

1699
01:32:16,256 --> 01:32:19,840
Disappointment might want to try one episode a special episode 30

1700
01:32:20,352 --> 01:32:21,632
The performa

1701
01:32:23,168 --> 01:32:24,448
I don't think I have the commitment

1702
01:32:26,496 --> 01:32:28,032
But Alex is a committed race

1703
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:31,360
And next blippi talks about how the Chinese

1704
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:40,576
Because he does give an example of one specific person who is not

1705
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:41,856
Mitch McConnell

1706
01:32:43,392 --> 01:32:45,440
That's what who are the most

1707
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:52,352
Please show more

1708
01:32:52,864 --> 01:32:57,216
The most racist people on earth

1709
01:32:58,752 --> 01:33:00,288
Chop't

1710
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:02,336
Wait the second

1711
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:06,944
Play music

1712
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:10,272
No no no no

1713
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:14,624
Yeah dude just say

1714
01:33:15,136 --> 01:33:15,648
Just say

1715
01:33:15,904 --> 01:33:20,256
Like Bing Bong or some other races version of like they're all the same

1716
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:32,800
What's a what Chinese country are you from Laos is that the one

1717
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:38,688
Pretty overt

1718
01:33:38,944 --> 01:33:42,272
That really is Alex is trying to

1719
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:48,928
Pretend he's not racist and other people are and then he just bodies

1720
01:33:49,184 --> 01:33:51,744
Racist opposition

1721
01:33:55,072 --> 01:33:55,584
Bright

1722
01:33:56,096 --> 01:33:58,400
So some Chinese people are Tracy

1723
01:33:58,656 --> 01:34:00,960
Congratulations on your brain work

1724
01:34:05,568 --> 01:34:08,640
This is a representation of the disjoint

1725
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:11,200
He brought it up earlier

1726
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:14,528
Drugs

1727
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:25,792
And then we would have ruled the planet

1728
01:34:26,304 --> 01:34:27,072
Audiology

1729
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:27,840
A free market

1730
01:34:28,352 --> 01:34:30,400
And you could have sat on top of it but you had

1731
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:31,424
Needle

1732
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:32,448
Ding-a-ling

1733
01:34:37,568 --> 01:34:38,080
Dementia

1734
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:54,208
He said once as hell

1735
01:34:54,464 --> 01:34:58,304
Making it up that he uses that

1736
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:04,704
What is that we already heard earlier in the episode Alex

1737
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:07,520
Is Big main gripe with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation

1738
01:35:07,776 --> 01:35:09,056
They're brainwashing people

1739
01:35:09,312 --> 01:35:09,824
White

1740
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:13,408
Earlier

1741
01:35:13,664 --> 01:35:18,016
That's part of the chickenshit dimension

1742
01:35:20,064 --> 01:35:24,416
Lord it over a free-market world dominated by

1743
01:35:24,672 --> 01:35:25,696
White people

1744
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:29,792
Decided to brainwash people against whites

1745
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:32,096
You saying is you guys f***** up

1746
01:35:33,632 --> 01:35:37,472
You guys could have been

1747
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:39,776
As opposed to a really rich

1748
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:44,640
I also think that after having that episode about the British is realism

1749
01:35:44,896 --> 01:35:46,176
Christian identity ideas

1750
01:35:46,432 --> 01:35:47,712
Tough to hear that sort of

1751
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:49,760
You know you could have

1752
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:54,880
Bad world's not here a little bit of that in there as well

1753
01:35:55,392 --> 01:35:56,928
That's going to keep popping

1754
01:35:57,696 --> 01:36:00,768
Also you know we talkin about the globalist

1755
01:36:01,024 --> 01:36:04,096
Bill Gates

1756
01:36:04,864 --> 01:36:09,216
I'd like to read to you from the protocols of the Elders of Zion

1757
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:14,592
We should destroy about the importance of Education

1758
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:20,992
This is followed up in this way we shall create a blind before switch will never be in a position

1759
01:36:21,248 --> 01:36:23,808
Removing any direction without the guidance of our agents

1760
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:27,136
Leaders of the mob

1761
01:36:27,392 --> 01:36:29,952
The people will submit to this regime because it will know

1762
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:33,280
Better leaders will depend its earnings gratification

1763
01:36:33,792 --> 01:36:34,816
Receipt of all kinds of

1764
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:37,888
So I mean what do you describe

1765
01:36:38,144 --> 01:36:39,680
Destroy the family in order to make us

1766
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:41,216
Less able to

1767
01:36:41,472 --> 01:36:46,592
Have our political directly from the protocols

1768
01:36:47,104 --> 01:36:48,896
It was really weird when I read those

1769
01:36:49,152 --> 01:36:53,504
And protocol number 11 was and will send people to the chickenshit dimension

1770
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:59,904
Bright International

1771
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:03,488
I mean Alex isn't making that accusation but it isn't

1772
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,048
That's been fairly popular in

1773
01:37:08,096 --> 01:37:12,192
In 2012 Iranian vice president mohammad-reza Rakim

1774
01:37:12,448 --> 01:37:13,216
Gave a speech

1775
01:37:16,288 --> 01:37:20,128
For anybody

1776
01:37:20,384 --> 01:37:22,688
Research and find one

1777
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:23,968
They do not exist

1778
01:37:24,224 --> 01:37:26,272
This is proof of their involvement at the drugstore

1779
01:37:26,784 --> 01:37:31,904
A European diplomat

1780
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:36,768
This was definitely one of the worst I've ever heard in my life

1781
01:37:37,024 --> 01:37:43,168
Iranian hsieh hsieh clerk cleric

1782
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:48,288
Dude

1783
01:37:49,568 --> 01:37:50,336
So like

1784
01:37:50,592 --> 01:37:51,616
Do you have this bike

1785
01:37:51,872 --> 01:37:56,992
Specific purpose direct parallels

1786
01:37:57,248 --> 01:37:58,016
To the protocols

1787
01:37:58,272 --> 01:38:00,832
They're bringing drugs in

1788
01:38:01,088 --> 01:38:02,880
You know that is also

1789
01:38:03,392 --> 01:38:04,672
Anti-semitic propaganda

1790
01:38:04,928 --> 01:38:05,952
Is it good to hear

1791
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:08,512
Bring that up whenever

1792
01:38:09,792 --> 01:38:10,816
Very clearly

1793
01:38:15,936 --> 01:38:22,080
So I kind of think he's already got about Bill and Melinda Gates

1794
01:38:22,336 --> 01:38:24,896
The function of the disjointed

1795
01:38:25,152 --> 01:38:28,480
He himself kind of thinks he's covered it already

1796
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,696
Daily Caller news Foundation

1797
01:38:38,464 --> 01:38:40,000
Found it all being funded

1798
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:45,632
Black lives matter

1799
01:38:45,888 --> 01:38:46,656
Kill the cops

1800
01:38:50,752 --> 01:38:52,288
But I guess I already did

1801
01:38:53,312 --> 01:38:54,848
You want to hear this professor

1802
01:39:10,976 --> 01:39:12,256
I thought I already kind of covered it

1803
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:14,816
That is pretty funny

1804
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:20,704
Play music forgot exactly what it was

1805
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:27,104
Was going to stay near the music

1806
01:39:29,408 --> 01:39:35,552
So $1,000 a pop example professors he said you want to hear this

1807
01:39:35,808 --> 01:39:36,320
Professor dementor

1808
01:39:36,576 --> 01:39:37,344
The Daily Caller

1809
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:39,136
Read this article

1810
01:39:39,392 --> 01:39:40,416
Is basing his narrative on

1811
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:41,184
Daily Caller

1812
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:44,000
And I don't know if I

1813
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:47,840
Literally the only connection any of this has the bill

1814
01:39:48,096 --> 01:39:48,864
Their Foundation

1815
01:39:52,192 --> 01:39:53,472
Has hired the person

1816
01:39:53,728 --> 01:39:55,520
50s hit piece article is about

1817
01:39:56,288 --> 01:40:00,640
The article discusses Robin diangelo the PHD in Multicultural education

1818
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:03,456
And is what is a well-respected lecturer and author of

1819
01:40:03,712 --> 01:40:04,224
Banfield

1820
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:06,528
She's the person who coined the term white fragility

1821
01:40:06,784 --> 01:40:10,368
Very specific expression of

1822
01:40:10,624 --> 01:40:12,416
Exactly that I was going to say

1823
01:40:12,928 --> 01:40:14,464
Come on guys

1824
01:40:15,232 --> 01:40:15,744
The worst

1825
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:16,768
Literally

1826
01:40:17,024 --> 01:40:19,328
The entire thrust of this article he received

1827
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:21,888
He charges $12,000 for a speaking appearance

1828
01:40:22,144 --> 01:40:25,728
Scholarship and Oliver work

1829
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:27,008
Because she's

1830
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:32,640
What's the rate of $12,000

1831
01:40:32,896 --> 01:40:39,040
Daily Caller

1832
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:44,416
$12,000 for speaking engagement is not really that high rate for a purse

1833
01:40:44,672 --> 01:40:46,208
Particular

1834
01:40:48,512 --> 01:40:50,048
A simple search of talent

1835
01:40:52,352 --> 01:40:56,192
For instance Ben Shapiro charges between 50 and $100,000 for a speech

1836
01:40:56,448 --> 01:40:57,216
Jordan Peterson

1837
01:40:57,472 --> 01:41:00,032
402 200000 as does Sean Hannity

1838
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:02,080
Alex's buddy Candace Owens charge

1839
01:41:02,336 --> 01:41:03,872
Between 20 and 30000

1840
01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:07,712
James O'Keefe is right in the same ballpark as Misty Angelo with a price range

1841
01:41:07,968 --> 01:41:09,248
210 to 20000 per speed

1842
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:11,040
Bill O'Reilly charges 100

1843
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:12,064
The 200,000

1844
01:41:12,576 --> 01:41:15,392
John Ashcroft requires 50000-100000

1845
01:41:15,648 --> 01:41:18,208
Take a break from running a law firm with Alex's Preferred Choice for

1846
01:41:18,464 --> 01:41:19,744
Director of National Intelligence

1847
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,560
Alex is Buddy and noted pervert Ted Nugent charges

1848
01:41:22,816 --> 01:41:24,352
50 to 100 thousand dollars

1849
01:41:24,608 --> 01:41:25,888
I think you get the point

1850
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:32,544
Not in the fields of either being an in-demand lecture or booking into lectures

1851
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:33,824
Lehigh

1852
01:41:34,336 --> 01:41:35,360
But ultimately it's not

1853
01:41:35,872 --> 01:41:37,664
When you look at the larger picture of the industry

1854
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:38,688
It's kind of

1855
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:40,992
On the lower end of an in-demand

1856
01:41:42,016 --> 01:41:43,808
This is a cheap trick that propaganda

1857
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:47,392
Confused about social justice or economic

1858
01:41:47,648 --> 01:41:48,672
Equality as a hypocrite

1859
01:41:48,928 --> 01:41:51,744
And then they get to feel entitled to just ignore the entire message

1860
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:54,048
It's a strategy self-defense

1861
01:41:54,304 --> 01:41:55,072
Honestly this

1862
01:41:55,328 --> 01:41:55,840
Situation

1863
01:41:56,352 --> 01:41:59,168
It goes a long way toward proving it Robin diangelo

1864
01:41:59,424 --> 01:42:00,192
Deserves that speaker

1865
01:42:00,448 --> 01:42:00,960
Great

1866
01:42:01,216 --> 01:42:01,728
Because

1867
01:42:01,984 --> 01:42:03,776
Their Manifesto

1868
01:42:04,032 --> 01:42:04,544
About

1869
01:42:05,056 --> 01:42:11,200
Concept of white fragility founded by noted white nationalist Tucker Carlson

1870
01:42:11,456 --> 01:42:14,784
Crying bloody murder about her charging a reasonable rate for her services

1871
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:16,832
Largely because they're afraid of the topic

1872
01:42:17,344 --> 01:42:17,856
Luxury

1873
01:42:18,368 --> 01:42:20,672
Literally

1874
01:42:20,928 --> 01:42:22,208
If it work

1875
01:42:22,464 --> 01:42:26,304
Then this is dumb how about the revulsion they have

1876
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:29,376
Is way better targets Pikachu's then D'Angelo

1877
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:30,656
Also

1878
01:42:30,912 --> 01:42:32,960
Tucker Carlson charges over $70,000

1879
01:42:36,032 --> 01:42:38,336
I don't understand

1880
01:42:38,592 --> 01:42:39,104
Like

1881
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:40,640
Did you did you get

1882
01:42:41,152 --> 01:42:42,688
Screwed over in the Equifax breach

1883
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:44,736
No I checked

1884
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:51,904
I did I don't understand

1885
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:55,488
Because they are going to run out of money whatever

1886
01:42:58,048 --> 01:42:59,584
Just going after these idiots

Steal their money Robinhood

1888
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:08,800
That's what I'm saying I don't know if I'm not going to double down on your

1889
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:10,848
Possession

1890
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:14,944
So there's nothing

1891
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:19,552
Foundation they're listed as one of the people who have

1892
01:43:20,576 --> 01:43:22,368
Paper service

1893
01:43:22,624 --> 01:43:23,392
That's the closest

1894
01:43:23,904 --> 01:43:26,208
And it's one of a number

1895
01:43:26,464 --> 01:43:28,000
Groups or organizations

1896
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:31,840
This isn't about the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation

1897
01:43:32,352 --> 01:43:34,656
Specifically being her Patron

1898
01:43:38,496 --> 01:43:40,544
Of course because he wants to

1899
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:42,592
He hates the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation

1900
01:43:43,104 --> 01:43:44,640
He thinks that they're brainwashing people again

1901
01:43:51,552 --> 01:43:53,856
He's using this article as the justification

1902
01:43:55,392 --> 01:43:56,416
Bulshit

1903
01:43:56,672 --> 01:43:57,440
It's all good

1904
01:43:57,696 --> 01:43:58,464
Lindsey

1905

Facebook has been set up

1908
01:44:31,744 --> 01:44:37,632
You really had to pause there before conservative wonder where his brain was

1909
01:44:38,144 --> 01:44:42,240
So Alex is commercial time on the show has become

1910
01:44:43,264 --> 01:44:44,288
A real

1911
01:44:44,544 --> 01:44:45,568
Sad place

1912
01:44:50,944 --> 01:44:55,552

1920
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:32,928
It's very sad

1921
01:45:34,208 --> 01:45:34,720
Gloating

1922
01:45:34,976 --> 01:45:35,488
Same time

1923
01:45:35,744 --> 01:45:37,280
I don't feel like I am

1924
01:45:37,536 --> 01:45:41,888
You only have 400 people

1925
01:45:42,144 --> 01:45:43,424

1927
01:45:45,216 --> 01:45:47,264

This is a very

1929
01:45:49,312 --> 01:45:51,616
Dangerous looking lack of Engagement

1930
01:45:55,968 --> 01:45:58,272
He shows up Joe Bannister brother

1931
01:45:58,528 --> 01:46:00,320
He wants to talk about the Garlic Festival

1932
01:46:01,344 --> 01:46:01,856
He got nothing

1933
01:46:02,624 --> 01:46:03,904
Really no insight

1934
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:04,672
Here is

1935
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:06,720
What I would describe as his expert

1936
01:46:07,744 --> 01:46:09,280
I certainly these type of things

1937
01:46:09,536 --> 01:46:11,840
Take you no hours if not days

1938
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:13,120
To hash out

1939
01:46:13,632 --> 01:46:15,424
And I do understand that the

1940
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:16,192
This morning

1941
01:46:16,448 --> 01:46:17,216
They did

1942
01:46:17,728 --> 01:46:18,752
Service search warrant

1943
01:46:19,008 --> 01:46:20,288
At the suspects

1944
01:46:20,544 --> 01:46:21,056
Residence

1945
01:46:21,312 --> 01:46:24,640
So I'm sure they will learn as the days go by

1946
01:46:24,896 --> 01:46:25,664
What the

1947
01:46:26,176 --> 01:46:28,736
This says Shooters motivations were

1948
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:39,232
No that's pretty responsive

1949
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:45,376
Right that's not what Alex was probably

1950
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:51,776
Boils down to

1951
01:46:52,032 --> 01:46:57,920
What you do if you want to kill yourself

1952
01:46:58,176 --> 01:47:00,480
What we needed more guns garlic

1953
01:47:00,992 --> 01:47:01,760
South that's weekend

1954
01:47:02,016 --> 01:47:04,832
So interview is real boring

1955
01:47:08,928 --> 01:47:09,952
We get it

1956
01:47:10,208 --> 01:47:12,768
Allison starts rambling

1957
01:47:13,024 --> 01:47:13,792
About like

1958
01:47:14,304 --> 01:47:16,864
The globalists need to bring in the global government

1959
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:17,632
Now

1960
01:47:18,656 --> 01:47:19,680
For a specific reason

1961
01:47:20,192 --> 01:47:21,216
I think

1962
01:47:21,984 --> 01:47:23,008
I don't think I agree with

1963
01:47:25,056 --> 01:47:25,568
Is wrong

1964
01:47:34,272 --> 01:47:35,296
Because all these

1965
01:47:35,552 --> 01:47:36,320
Technologies are

1966
01:47:36,576 --> 01:47:37,088
Coming forward now

1967
01:47:39,904 --> 01:47:42,976
Controller

1968
01:47:44,256 --> 01:47:46,560
Where will be multiplanetary

1969
01:47:46,816 --> 01:47:47,328
Will be

1970
01:47:48,864 --> 01:47:49,632
Interstellar

1971
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:51,168
So fast

1972
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:56,032
Will be

1973
01:47:58,080 --> 01:48:01,664
You think fire was invented

1974
01:48:02,688 --> 01:48:08,832
Love the shifting globalist they're doing what they're doing

1975
01:48:09,344 --> 01:48:12,416
So much over the course of his career I love that now

1976
01:48:12,672 --> 01:48:13,696
In the present day

1977
01:48:13,952 --> 01:48:14,976
His excuses

1978
01:48:15,488 --> 01:48:18,816
They need to make a One World Government because we're about to go to space

1979
01:48:19,072 --> 01:48:20,864
They want to be in control of Mars

1980
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:22,144
Or whatever

1981
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:23,680
It's just like I don't understand

1982
01:48:24,448 --> 01:48:24,960
What are you missing

1983
01:48:25,984 --> 01:48:31,360
I'm missing the jump from that used to be about like creating just a dictatorship making a prison

1984
01:48:31,616 --> 01:48:37,760
I'm missing the time when it was a financially motivated

1985
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:42,880
Of all the globalist

1986
01:48:43,392 --> 01:48:47,232
Plans is that all of them according to Alex are incredibly long-term

1987
01:48:50,048 --> 01:48:55,424
So frequently like I don't I don't know I have mixed feelings

1988
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:59,008
Idiot world government

1989
01:48:59,264 --> 01:49:04,128
The wrong people administering it would be the worst literal worse than another guy

1990
01:49:04,384 --> 01:49:05,664
But I do

1991
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:06,432
It's some sort of

1992
01:49:06,688 --> 01:49:12,832
Collaboration Global probably required

1993
01:49:13,088 --> 01:49:14,624
Go into faith and start calling

1994
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:15,392
Parts of space

1995
01:49:15,904 --> 01:49:22,048
We would need a one world government

1996
01:49:22,304 --> 01:49:26,912
Russia other countries are going to be

1997
01:49:27,168 --> 01:49:29,728
What are you going to do go to war

1998
01:49:29,984 --> 01:49:33,568
Keep them from going to space

1999
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:34,592
Literally

2000
01:49:39,712 --> 01:49:44,064
Able to leave the planet and still have

2001
01:49:44,576 --> 01:49:45,088
Tensions

2002
01:49:45,344 --> 01:49:45,856
Between us

2003
01:49:46,368 --> 01:49:48,928
Just based on where on this f****** Earth

2004
01:49:49,184 --> 01:49:51,488
We came from absurd

2005
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:52,512
CID

2006
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:57,120
All the progress you could make

2007
01:49:59,168 --> 01:50:00,448
Seriously

2008
01:50:00,704 --> 01:50:01,216
Amazing

2009
01:50:01,728 --> 01:50:02,240
Advance

2010
01:50:06,848 --> 01:50:10,176
It could all be jeopardized by China coming in with space

2011
01:50:10,432 --> 01:50:16,576
Ever want to make it to that next level while they're still deposit

2012
01:50:16,832 --> 01:50:18,880
Ability that we're going to fight with each other in ruin all of it

2013
01:50:19,392 --> 01:50:19,904
It's silly

2014
01:50:20,416 --> 01:50:22,720
Play the

2015
01:50:23,232 --> 01:50:24,512
Colonisation Wars

2016
01:50:24,768 --> 01:50:26,304
Of Europe from

2017
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:29,376
1600

2018
01:50:29,632 --> 01:50:31,680
I mean it wouldn't even be catastrophic

2019
01:50:32,192 --> 01:50:32,704
Destroy

2020
01:50:33,472 --> 01:50:35,008
You know like of course

2021
01:50:35,264 --> 01:50:38,080
Okay so we destroyed New America

2022
01:50:38,336 --> 01:50:39,360
Jupiter's moon

2023
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:42,176
Maybe what we should have done instead of just

2024
01:50:42,688 --> 01:50:43,456
Destroy America

2025
01:50:44,224 --> 01:50:44,736
On Earth

2026
01:50:44,992 --> 01:50:47,040
Easier

2027
01:50:47,296 --> 01:50:53,184
Why would we send Rockets all the way out there glow up credibly dystopian possibility

2028
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:54,464
The idea of

2029
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:56,512
Branching out in colonizing

2030
01:50:56,768 --> 01:50:57,792
Without

2031
01:50:58,816 --> 01:51:00,096
Absolute collaboration

2032
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:02,656
It just seems like

2033
01:51:03,424 --> 01:51:05,728
It seems like childish it whenever you can

2034
01:51:05,984 --> 01:51:10,080
Consider the Stars

2035
01:51:10,336 --> 01:51:11,104
Gundam

2036
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:12,128
And in that situation

2037
01:51:12,384 --> 01:51:12,896
What

2038
01:51:13,152 --> 01:51:14,432
Every country

2039
01:51:14,688 --> 01:51:15,200
Colonizer

2040
01:51:15,712 --> 01:51:16,224
Places in

2041
01:51:17,248 --> 01:51:18,272
And then creates very race

2042
01:51:18,528 --> 01:51:19,040
Cheapest robots

2043
01:51:22,624 --> 01:51:24,160
Interesting interesting series

2044
01:51:25,184 --> 01:51:25,952
Fair enough

2045
01:51:26,208 --> 01:51:28,512
So this is

2046
01:51:28,768 --> 01:51:31,840
Get to the Marion Williamson video

2047
01:51:32,352 --> 01:51:35,424
Make fun of her but interrupting

2048
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:36,448
To be presented

2049
01:51:36,704 --> 01:51:37,984
Tucci's

2050
01:51:38,496 --> 01:51:40,288
Leading these people in apologizing

2051
01:51:40,544 --> 01:51:42,848
Before the horrors of slavery in our country's history

2052
01:51:44,128 --> 01:51:48,224
Alex refuses to engage with the ideas of that the lingering effect

2053
01:51:48,736 --> 01:51:49,760
Economically

2054
01:51:50,016 --> 01:51:51,040
Sociological

2055
01:51:51,552 --> 01:51:54,368
Politically that have rippled

2056
01:51:54,624 --> 01:51:56,160
Still impact

2057
01:51:56,416 --> 01:52:00,000
Today about how

2058
01:52:00,256 --> 01:52:02,304
He shouldn't feel guilty about slavery

2059
01:52:02,816 --> 01:52:03,840
He didn't do it

2060
01:52:04,352 --> 01:52:05,376
No one did it

2061
01:52:05,888 --> 01:52:06,912
Almost nobody did it

2062
01:52:07,168 --> 01:52:11,008
Not much like him saying that the Chinese are racist except for his Korean sister

2063
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:13,056
Alex starts off on this

2064
01:52:13,312 --> 01:52:13,824
Clip

2065
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:16,128
Feel guilty

2066
01:52:16,384 --> 01:52:17,152
About slavery

2067
01:52:17,664 --> 01:52:19,968
Then says something deeply races

2068
01:52:20,992 --> 01:52:23,808
Margery Williams

2069
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:31,744
If your great-grandfather was a

2070
01:52:34,048 --> 01:52:35,328
You're an independent person

2071
01:52:35,584 --> 01:52:36,864
Only 2% of people

2072
01:52:43,008 --> 01:52:46,336
Most people are European

2073
01:52:56,832 --> 01:52:57,344
Is that what it is

2074
01:52:58,624 --> 01:52:59,904
Color

2075
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:07,072
Amazing

2076
01:53:07,328 --> 01:53:08,096
Collective guilt

2077
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:10,912
Zimbabwe

2078
01:53:11,424 --> 01:53:12,192
No

2079
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:15,520
This is so evil

2080
01:53:18,848 --> 01:53:19,872
Subway

2081
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:23,200
Is your your example is Rhodesia bro

2082
01:53:26,528 --> 01:53:27,296
Yep

2083
01:53:27,552 --> 01:53:28,832
Example

2084
01:53:29,088 --> 01:53:30,368
Is

2085
01:53:31,136 --> 01:53:32,672
Rhodesia

2086
01:53:36,256 --> 01:53:37,792
Yep yep

2087
01:53:38,048 --> 01:53:44,192
That he's trying to argue against him feel guilty about slavery in immediately

2088
01:53:44,448 --> 01:53:44,960
Is

2089
01:53:45,216 --> 01:53:46,496
A repressive

2090
01:53:46,752 --> 01:53:47,264
Supremacist

2091
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:48,288
Apartheid government

2092
01:53:50,592 --> 01:53:51,616
Brutal Colonial

2093
01:53:51,872 --> 01:53:53,152
System that was put in place

2094
01:53:53,408 --> 01:53:54,944
In modern-day Zimbabwe

2095
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:57,248
That is so f***** up to me

2096
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:02,624
It was a good exam

2097
01:54:06,464 --> 01:54:08,768
That was the headliner

2098
01:54:12,864 --> 01:54:13,376
We had this

2099
01:54:13,632 --> 01:54:14,144
Really

2100
01:54:14,912 --> 01:54:15,424
Stupid,

2101
01:54:18,752 --> 01:54:24,896
Say that first of all I'd like to say we had a stupid conversation on his part is a bucket

2102
01:54:25,152 --> 01:54:29,504
Play from

2103
01:54:30,016 --> 01:54:30,784
He said

2104
01:54:32,064 --> 01:54:32,576
No I think

2105
01:54:32,832 --> 01:54:34,112
Whites are free

2106
01:54:35,904 --> 01:54:36,672
Mainly because

2107
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:40,512
Minorities cuz we're going to have

2108
01:54:40,768 --> 01:54:42,560
Whites are going to be the minority soon

2109
01:54:44,096 --> 01:54:45,632
They're going to do the whites

2110
01:54:45,888 --> 01:54:46,400
What weed

2111
01:54:47,936 --> 01:54:48,448
And I was like

2112
01:54:57,920 --> 01:55:00,224
Admirable in some way that he's able to articulate

2113
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:07,904
Articulate it that way

2114
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:12,768
Which kind of makes it more difficult to deal with his b*******

2115
01:55:13,024 --> 01:55:13,536
That guy

2116
01:55:14,048 --> 01:55:17,120
You'd hoped there was a possibility of a dialogue you know cuz he's

2117
01:55:17,376 --> 01:55:18,144
He's willing to

2118
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:24,544
Express

2119
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:26,592
Do this in the green room I don't have right

2120
01:55:27,616 --> 01:55:29,408
Is little bit more racist

2121
01:55:29,664 --> 01:55:31,200
Also

2122
01:55:31,456 --> 01:55:32,480
He points out that

2123
01:55:32,736 --> 01:55:33,248
Some Churches

2124
01:55:33,504 --> 01:55:34,784
But not the donation tray

2125
01:55:35,296 --> 01:55:36,832
But they're not taking my money and giving it

2126
01:55:37,088 --> 01:55:39,136

2136
01:56:21,888 --> 01:56:22,656
Wow

2137
01:56:22,912 --> 01:56:27,520
Wow that's why I usually

2138
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:32,128
I don't know are they

2139
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:37,504
Why do I know one of them did do the prayer at

I know I can't imagine.

2145
01:56:59,776 --> 01:57:00,800
Being like alright

2146
01:57:01,312 --> 01:57:02,080
So

2147
01:57:02,336 --> 01:57:03,616
We're going to take

2148
01:57:03,872 --> 01:57:04,384
Sims 4

2149
01:57:05,152 --> 01:57:07,712
One of the richest people in the world

2150
01:57:08,224 --> 01:57:08,992
It doesn't seem

2151
01:57:10,784 --> 01:57:16,928
Anyway

2152
01:57:17,696 --> 01:57:22,304
Based on my daily Colorado

2153
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:24,096
Expensive

2154
01:57:24,352 --> 01:57:26,144
Bill Gates Bill Gates

2155
01:57:29,216 --> 01:57:29,728
Station

2156
01:57:45,088 --> 01:57:46,624
West is inherently evil

2157
01:57:50,464 --> 01:57:52,256
Trying to get white genocide

2158
01:57:52,512 --> 01:57:58,656
Say that we are you trying to say

2159
01:57:58,912 --> 01:58:05,056
Meaning the same thing

2160
01:58:05,312 --> 01:58:08,640
Is Western culture

2161
01:58:09,152 --> 01:58:13,248
Stop

2162
01:58:14,784 --> 01:58:16,064
I just hide behind

2163
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:17,856
Terms used interchangeably

2164
01:58:18,112 --> 01:58:20,672
And assume the people aren't going to notice and call you out on it

2165
01:58:21,184 --> 01:58:22,464
Every single time

2166
01:58:22,720 --> 01:58:24,512
It's exactly the same thing

2167
01:58:24,768 --> 01:58:27,328
As with the preacher Smith

2168
01:58:27,584 --> 01:58:29,888
We talked about the children of Esau beat

2169
01:58:30,144 --> 01:58:33,216
Absolutely about Western

2170
01:58:33,472 --> 01:58:36,288
Civilization Western culture he's talking about white

2171
01:58:37,568 --> 01:58:38,080
As what he's doing

2172
01:58:38,336 --> 01:58:42,176
You bet he just makes up

2173
01:58:42,688 --> 01:58:43,456
Professor is

2174
01:58:43,968 --> 01:58:45,248
Mainly funded

2175
01:58:45,504 --> 01:58:46,016
5 Gates

2176
01:58:50,368 --> 01:58:51,648
$12,000

2177
01:58:53,696 --> 01:58:59,840
Already is a misrepresentation

2178
01:59:00,096 --> 01:59:06,240
Maybe one or two engagements

2179
01:59:06,496 --> 01:59:07,264
Such.

2180
01:59:14,432 --> 01:59:15,712
You Got The Touch

2181
01:59:18,528 --> 01:59:19,808
Got a text

2182
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:29,792
He doesn't have anything to back that up he is just a starting it based on nothing to this article that doesn't

2183
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:31,072
Bulshit

2184
01:59:31,328 --> 01:59:31,840
Used

2185
01:59:32,352 --> 01:59:33,632
I just saying whatever you want

2186
01:59:34,144 --> 01:59:37,216
It's crazy

2187
01:59:37,472 --> 01:59:38,240
The things

2188
01:59:38,496 --> 01:59:40,544
He bases his rhetoric in his narrative

2189
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:42,848
It's so clear that like

2190
01:59:43,616 --> 01:59:44,640
Nothing can be dropped

2191
01:59:45,152 --> 01:59:46,688
Yeah

2192
01:59:46,944 --> 01:59:48,224
Could just be made up

2193
01:59:48,736 --> 01:59:51,040
He reports made up s***

2194
01:59:51,296 --> 01:59:52,064
With the same

2195
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:52,832
Confidence

2196
01:59:53,344 --> 01:59:54,112
Betty does

2197
01:59:54,368 --> 01:59:55,136
Reading at

2198
01:59:57,184 --> 01:59:57,952
She has

2199
01:59:58,976 --> 02:00:00,000
Grounds for a libel

2200
02:00:01,536 --> 02:00:07,680
This can't be construed as deliberately lying about somebody

2201
02:00:12,032 --> 02:00:16,384
I think I text you probably could I also think it probably isn't worth

2202
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:18,688
What are you doing

2203
02:00:18,944 --> 02:00:19,968
Is that

2204
02:00:22,528 --> 02:00:25,856
I apologize

2205
02:00:26,112 --> 02:00:26,624
Mistake

2206
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:29,184
So earlier Alex

2207
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:32,768
Pointed out

2208
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:35,072
It's another teaching really on White Street

2209
02:00:35,584 --> 02:00:36,864
No it's not I really don't

2210
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:38,144
It's not but

2211
02:00:39,424 --> 02:00:39,936
How he can

2212
02:00:40,192 --> 02:00:40,704
Conceived

2213
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:41,472
How

2214
02:00:41,728 --> 02:00:43,008
People got rid of

2215
02:00:43,776 --> 02:00:46,848
This race well it was because the South Korean Chinese person told him

2216
02:00:47,104 --> 02:00:48,384
That could be

2217
02:00:51,200 --> 02:00:52,480
Got rid of tribalism

2218
02:00:53,248 --> 02:00:54,272
Real

2219
02:00:54,528 --> 02:01:00,672
Jesus Christ

2220
02:01:05,536 --> 02:01:06,560
If you accept

2221
02:01:08,096 --> 02:01:09,376
And you accept free-market ID

2222
02:01:11,936 --> 02:01:12,960
Is Wellfleet we come together

2223
02:01:17,568 --> 02:01:19,872
Be looking at now is

2224
02:01:20,128 --> 02:01:22,688
Theocratic government

2225
02:01:22,944 --> 02:01:23,968
Economia

2226
02:01:25,248 --> 02:01:26,784
Really weird is banana

2227
02:01:27,040 --> 02:01:27,552
Yeah

2228
02:01:27,808 --> 02:01:33,952
Choose from the New and Old Testaments in order to make their cases for what Christianity

2229
02:01:34,208 --> 02:01:34,976
You should be

2230
02:01:35,232 --> 02:01:36,768
They ascribe to Jesus

2231
02:01:37,024 --> 02:01:43,168
I feel like I should be able to play that game every now and again to his I'm going to have fun as long as biblical

2232
02:01:45,728 --> 02:01:51,872
Reintroduce the law of Jubilee 5

2233
02:01:52,128 --> 02:01:56,480
It's out of a different tube

2234
02:01:56,736 --> 02:02:02,368
Property even property sold in intervening years is to revert back to the original owner

2235
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:05,696
But if you bought you were living on

2236
02:02:05,952 --> 02:02:07,744
To your family's original property

2237
02:02:08,256 --> 02:02:11,584
It's laid out that if you sell someone lands closer to the year to believe

2238
02:02:13,376 --> 02:02:17,728
Since a person is going to have less time on this planet

2239
02:02:18,240 --> 02:02:18,752
I like that

2240
02:02:19,776 --> 02:02:21,056
This is a law

2241
02:02:23,616 --> 02:02:25,920
Because there is no private property rights for humans

2242
02:02:27,200 --> 02:02:28,480
Explicitly expressed quote

2243
02:02:28,992 --> 02:02:29,760
This is God speaking

2244
02:02:34,368 --> 02:02:37,696
Prepare myself for that the land must not be sold permanently

2245
02:02:37,952 --> 02:02:39,232
Because the land is mine

2246
02:02:39,488 --> 02:02:42,304
If you reside in my land as foreigners and strangers

2247
02:02:43,328 --> 02:02:46,400
If you buy a house yet to give that house back in the Year of Jubilee

2248
02:02:46,656 --> 02:02:49,728
Except that houses in a walled City

2249
02:02:49,984 --> 02:02:51,776
If it's

2250
02:02:55,360 --> 02:02:59,456
Man I love good old throwing spaghetti at the wall

2251
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:03,552
It's a weird setting rules

2252
02:03:04,064 --> 02:03:05,600
So Alex

2253
02:03:06,112 --> 02:03:07,392
Also she want to go do test

2254
02:03:07,904 --> 02:03:10,208
Jesus

2255
02:03:11,744 --> 02:03:14,304
Do not store up for yourselves Treasures on Earth

2256
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:15,328
Where moth and rust

2257
02:03:15,584 --> 02:03:19,680
Destroy and where thieves break in and steal yourself Treasures in Heaven

2258
02:03:20,192 --> 02:03:21,216
Where moth and rust do not.

2259
02:03:21,472 --> 02:03:23,008
Destroy

2260
02:03:23,776 --> 02:03:25,824
For where your treasure is there your heart will be also

2261
02:03:26,592 --> 02:03:29,664
Passage in Luke 6 where Jesus

2262
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:36,064
People to lend other people money with no expectation of being repaid

2263
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:38,624
Merciful quote just as your father is

2264
02:03:39,904 --> 02:03:43,232
There's a lot of folks who try to make the argument that Jesus would have been on their side

2265
02:03:43,488 --> 02:03:46,816
Support their ideology if you were around

2266
02:03:47,328 --> 02:03:50,144
There's so much in the Bible that you can really pick and choose a lot

2267
02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:52,960
How to make contradictory arguments

2268
02:03:55,008 --> 02:03:59,360
Jesus was into free market capitalism

2269
02:03:59,616 --> 02:04:00,384
Yeah I can't

2270
02:04:04,736 --> 02:04:06,016
Biblical scholar in

2271
02:04:07,552 --> 02:04:08,576
The free market your

2272
02:04:14,464 --> 02:04:19,840
Professor

2273
02:04:20,352 --> 02:04:22,144
Speeches

2274
02:04:22,912 --> 02:04:25,984
Recorded up title

2275
02:04:37,504 --> 02:04:41,600
We have the exact

2276
02:04:42,112 --> 02:04:48,256
We have the exact is the conversation Alex refuses to have everybody is the exact same thing

2277
02:04:48,512 --> 02:04:52,096
Yeah people like Victor Blackwell words

2278
02:04:52,352 --> 02:04:53,888
Cut that part out

2279
02:04:54,144 --> 02:04:55,680
Cuz he doesn't want to

2280
02:04:55,936 --> 02:04:56,704
To open that box

2281
02:04:57,472 --> 02:04:59,008
He's guilty of the exact same thing

2282
02:04:59,264 --> 02:05:01,312
Did Victor Blackwell

2283
02:05:06,944 --> 02:05:07,712
Actual racing

2284
02:05:08,736 --> 02:05:09,248
Hordes

2285
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:11,040
Text blackpink

2286
02:05:11,552 --> 02:05:12,320
Racist blacks

2287
02:05:17,952 --> 02:05:19,488
Robin diangelo

2288
02:05:20,512 --> 02:05:22,304
He is found

2289
02:05:23,072 --> 02:05:23,840
We have

2290
02:05:24,352 --> 02:05:27,936
Examples from earlier

2291
02:05:28,192 --> 02:05:31,776
City allows to play because he wants me to stand as a thing

2292
02:05:33,056 --> 02:05:34,080
Nonsense

2293
02:05:34,848 --> 02:05:38,432
He has a clip of Victor Blackwell which he has to interrupt constantly

2294
02:05:38,688 --> 02:05:40,992
This is stupid

2295
02:05:41,248 --> 02:05:42,272
Another clip

2296
02:05:42,784 --> 02:05:43,296
And it's

2297
02:05:43,808 --> 02:05:44,832
To the point where Alex

2298
02:05:45,088 --> 02:05:45,856
Can't allow it to

2299
02:05:46,112 --> 02:05:46,624
Play

2300
02:05:47,136 --> 02:05:53,280
It is to see oneself outside of Race To See oneself as unique special in

2301
02:05:53,536 --> 02:05:55,840
Individual exempt from the forces

2302
02:05:56,096 --> 02:05:58,400
Socialization

2303
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:09,408
I think so

2304
02:06:14,784 --> 02:06:19,648
Woman said to him I don't see color are you going to see racing

2305
02:06:19,904 --> 02:06:21,440
Because I am black

2306
02:06:21,696 --> 02:06:27,840
I do think you know that I have a different experience than you do and you're not going to be able to understand that I do not

2307
02:06:28,864 --> 02:06:35,008
The parts of that experience that are really painful and problematic you refuse to acknowledge

2308
02:06:35,264 --> 02:06:38,336
I don't see color is

2309
02:06:38,592 --> 02:06:39,104
Yeah

2310
02:06:42,944 --> 02:06:44,224
Good people check

2311
02:06:45,504 --> 02:06:46,528
I want to get along

2312
02:06:47,808 --> 02:06:48,832
I want to hire folks off

2313
02:06:52,928 --> 02:06:53,696
They're fighting

2314
02:06:57,024 --> 02:06:57,536
The abolition of

2315
02:06:58,816 --> 02:06:59,840
So I'll

2316
02:07:00,352 --> 02:07:00,864
Alex

2317
02:07:01,376 --> 02:07:02,400
Pasta

2318
02:07:02,656 --> 02:07:05,728
Because he started

2319
02:07:05,984 --> 02:07:09,568
This is completely different than I have been saying

2320
02:07:09,824 --> 02:07:10,336
KeyBank

2321
02:07:13,408 --> 02:07:13,920
Clearly

2322
02:07:16,736 --> 02:07:17,504
About

2323
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:21,856
The different experiences of people of different ethnic and racial background

2324
02:07:22,112 --> 02:07:23,136
Arrowhead vet

2325
02:07:23,648 --> 02:07:25,952
Communicated to his

2326
02:07:26,208 --> 02:07:30,304
Absolutely

2327
02:07:30,816 --> 02:07:32,096
Without just being like

2328
02:07:35,936 --> 02:07:40,288
Good rebuttal videos capable of that doesn't drift into like

2329
02:07:40,544 --> 02:07:41,824
Just outright

2330
02:07:42,336 --> 02:07:44,384
And that's why you have to shut

2331
02:07:44,640 --> 02:07:47,200
You're the shut that off

2332
02:07:47,456 --> 02:07:51,808
Being about affirmative action or something

2333
02:07:52,320 --> 02:07:54,112
There's only the races for fun

2334
02:07:54,624 --> 02:07:55,648
Which is not a good

2335
02:07:55,904 --> 02:07:57,696
Write three gathers himself

2336
02:07:57,952 --> 02:07:59,744
He realizes because

2337
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,560
He's listened to part of the clip

2338
02:08:02,816 --> 02:08:05,120
Before the show

2339
02:08:05,376 --> 02:08:07,680
Any realizes that what it's about is

2340
02:08:07,936 --> 02:08:08,448
Knology

2341
02:08:08,704 --> 02:08:09,216
Different

2342
02:08:09,472 --> 02:08:11,776
Experiences that people in the country have Bass

2343
02:08:13,056 --> 02:08:15,616
Gathers himself and find his bearing

2344
02:08:17,152 --> 02:08:17,664
Either able to

2345
02:08:17,920 --> 02:08:19,200
To just be like love that

2346
02:08:20,480 --> 02:08:21,760
Acknowledging that there's different

2347
02:08:22,016 --> 02:08:22,528
Experiences

2348
02:08:22,784 --> 02:08:24,064
Itself is racist

2349
02:08:29,184 --> 02:08:29,696
Oh

2350
02:08:29,952 --> 02:08:31,232
No you got to see my color

2351
02:08:33,024 --> 02:08:34,304
No that's how you created

2352
02:08:34,816 --> 02:08:36,352
And then once it is about color

2353
02:08:42,752 --> 02:08:43,776
Walking down street

2354
02:08:44,032 --> 02:08:44,800
Let's go out to breakfast

2355
02:08:47,872 --> 02:08:49,920
Twenty-something black people come up

2356
02:08:50,176 --> 02:08:51,968
Embrace your eyes about your eyeball out

2357
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:54,528
Because you're white

2358
02:09:03,232 --> 02:09:05,792
F*** that white devil

2359
02:09:12,448 --> 02:09:18,592
I believe that they turn that music up pretty loud

2360
02:09:18,848 --> 02:09:23,200
Outbreak

2361
02:09:23,456 --> 02:09:24,992
Do black people attack

2362
02:09:25,248 --> 02:09:25,760
Is it

2363
02:09:28,576 --> 02:09:30,880
My audience real juice

2364
02:09:31,648 --> 02:09:33,184
It's it's really f***** up

2365
02:09:36,768 --> 02:09:37,536
God

2366
02:09:39,328 --> 02:09:41,632
It's pretty crazy

2367
02:09:41,888 --> 02:09:42,912
You can't even listen

2368
02:09:43,168 --> 02:09:43,680
To somebody

2369
02:09:44,192 --> 02:09:46,240
You immediately know

2370
02:09:46,496 --> 02:09:48,032
Alex

2371
02:09:48,544 --> 02:09:49,568
That what she was saying

2372
02:10:04,416 --> 02:10:06,464
It makes so much sense to him that he was

2373
02:10:06,720 --> 02:10:07,744
So terrified

2374
02:10:08,768 --> 02:10:09,792
He was terrified

2375
02:10:10,304 --> 02:10:14,144
Yeah I know

2376
02:10:14,400 --> 02:10:14,912
Without like

2377
02:10:15,168 --> 02:10:15,680
Some

2378
02:10:16,704 --> 02:10:17,472
Desire to

2379
02:10:17,728 --> 02:10:18,240
Happy challenge

2380
02:10:18,496 --> 02:10:19,008
A little bit

2381
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:23,360
Like I listen to Alex everyday

2382
02:10:24,128 --> 02:10:28,480
Why

2383
02:10:28,736 --> 02:10:29,760
Generally doesn't

2384
02:10:30,272 --> 02:10:31,552
But if he know

2385
02:10:31,808 --> 02:10:33,856
I don't listen to him the same way you listen

2386
02:10:34,112 --> 02:10:36,672
People who disagree with him.

2387
02:10:36,928 --> 02:10:38,208
Turn it off

2388
02:10:38,464 --> 02:10:41,536
This guy

2389
02:10:43,072 --> 02:10:44,096
Highlight of your day

2390
02:10:45,632 --> 02:10:51,776
I wish more that's for sure

2391
02:10:52,032 --> 02:10:54,336
More than we would be covering a very different

2392
02:10:54,592 --> 02:10:55,104
Esposo

2393
02:10:55,360 --> 02:10:56,128
It's it is

2394
02:10:56,640 --> 02:10:57,920
I don't know if I have

2395
02:10:59,968 --> 02:11:02,016
I don't think it's impossible

2396
02:11:02,272 --> 02:11:02,784
I don't

2397
02:11:03,040 --> 02:11:04,832
I'm ready

2398
02:11:05,344 --> 02:11:10,464
Everytime I dig into one of the stories opportunity to learn more

2399
02:11:11,744 --> 02:11:12,512
And easy always

2400
02:11:13,280 --> 02:11:13,792
Yep

2401
02:11:14,048 --> 02:11:15,328
But I still

2402
02:11:19,936 --> 02:11:21,472
Him spiraling out of

2403
02:11:21,728 --> 02:11:22,752
Control because

2404
02:11:24,032 --> 02:11:24,544
Is getting

2405
02:11:25,056 --> 02:11:25,568
Really

2406
02:11:25,824 --> 02:11:26,336
Frustrated

2407
02:11:26,592 --> 02:11:27,360
About these races

2408
02:11:28,384 --> 02:11:33,504
Are you pretty pissed off that he's been building up this narrative about Robin diangelo

2409
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:35,296
Throughout the entire episode

2410
02:11:35,552 --> 02:11:37,344
He's play this clip and it didn't

2411
02:11:37,600 --> 02:11:38,368
Say what you want

2412
02:11:39,392 --> 02:11:39,904
And so

2413
02:11:40,160 --> 02:11:40,928
Getting more races

2414
02:11:42,208 --> 02:11:42,976
In the last

2415
02:11:44,512 --> 02:11:46,304
Segments of the episode

2416
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:47,072
He's

2417
02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:48,608
Really

2418
02:11:48,864 --> 02:11:49,632
You pausing a lot

2419
02:11:50,144 --> 02:11:51,424
Islam Slow Down Speed

2420
02:11:53,216 --> 02:11:53,728
It's pretty f***** up

2421
02:11:55,264 --> 02:11:56,288
And they're hyper.

2422
02:11:56,800 --> 02:11:58,080
Minority shop

2423
02:12:00,640 --> 02:12:01,664
Fiendish group

2424

2425

Hell-bent

2426
02:12:05,248 --> 02:12:05,760
And everyone

2427
02:12:06,272 --> 02:12:06,784
Cheer

2428
02:12:13,696 --> 02:12:14,208
2 billion

2429

4 billion

02:12:25,984 --> 02:12:26,496
100

2434
02:12:35,200 --> 02:12:35,968
Each other videos

2435
02:12:36,224 --> 02:12:36,736
Mother and child

2436
02:12:38,016 --> 02:12:38,784
Crossing the tracks

2437
02:12:39,040 --> 02:12:41,088
White Berlin left-handed Goods

2438
02:12:44,672 --> 02:12:45,184
They stand

2439
02:12:45,440 --> 02:12:45,952
An army to kill

2440
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:48,512
Kill that arm

2441
02:12:49,280 --> 02:12:51,328
So

2442
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:52,352
F***** up

2443
02:12:53,632 --> 02:12:56,960
As far as I can tell Alex is completely making up huge elements

2444
02:12:57,216 --> 02:12:57,984
The story about that

2445
02:12:59,264 --> 02:12:59,776
Situation

2446
02:13:00,288 --> 02:13:03,616
A story about a woman and her child who were pushed in front of a train

2447
02:13:04,128 --> 02:13:05,408
Berlin

2448
02:13:05,664 --> 02:13:08,480
The child died

2449
02:13:10,016 --> 02:13:10,784
Alright

2450
02:13:11,040 --> 02:13:13,600
It is real in as much as it did

2451
02:13:15,648 --> 02:13:18,208
Are supported by any

2452
02:13:18,464 --> 02:13:18,976
Actual reporting

2453
02:13:19,232 --> 02:13:19,744
Another story

2454
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:21,280
Also it wasn't in Berlin News

2455
02:13:21,536 --> 02:13:22,048
In Frankfort

2456
02:13:22,560 --> 02:13:27,936
Articles about the events of independent Guardian German Outlets

2457
02:13:28,192 --> 02:13:29,216
Less reputable source

2458
02:13:29,728 --> 02:13:33,568
The perpetrator was in police custody but refused to speak with authorities

2459
02:13:33,824 --> 02:13:34,848
And no motive has been

2460
02:13:35,104 --> 02:13:35,616
Established

2461
02:13:36,896 --> 02:13:39,200
Whatever the reality of this ends up being

2462
02:13:39,456 --> 02:13:43,040
Alex the report that he was racially motivated

2463
02:13:43,296 --> 02:13:44,320
That the man push them

2464
02:13:44,576 --> 02:13:45,600
The tracks because they were white

2465
02:13:46,112 --> 02:13:47,904
You have nothing to back that up no

2466
02:13:48,160 --> 02:13:49,440
No source for it no justice

2467
02:13:49,696 --> 02:13:50,464
Application for his claim

2468
02:13:50,720 --> 02:13:53,792
Other than the fact that the media reported that the man was from Eritrea

2469
02:13:54,560 --> 02:13:55,840
That is all Alex needs to

2470
02:13:57,120 --> 02:13:57,632
Confidently

2471
02:13:57,888 --> 02:13:58,400
Absolutely

2472
02:13:58,912 --> 02:14:02,496
Did this is an out-of-control minority killing white people because they were white

2473
02:14:03,264 --> 02:14:04,288
I can't be clear about this

2474
02:14:04,544 --> 02:14:05,056
It doesn't

2475
02:14:05,312 --> 02:14:08,128
Matter what the end result of the investigation into this case

2476
02:14:08,384 --> 02:14:12,992
It may very well end up being that this individual did because he hated

2477
02:14:13,504 --> 02:14:14,016
That could be

2478
02:14:14,528 --> 02:14:17,344
Alex is doing is

2479
02:14:17,600 --> 02:14:18,112
Completely rapist

2480
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:24,000
He feels like this is a racially-motivated attack and that's enough for him to report it as that is if it is

2481
02:14:24,512 --> 02:14:25,024
And then

2482
02:14:25,280 --> 02:14:31,424
It's being proof that all whites are under attack Africans are being wound up

2483
02:14:31,680 --> 02:14:32,192
Civilization

2484
02:14:33,984 --> 02:14:38,080
Someone who wasn't interested in promoting racism and white identity would not do this

2485
02:14:38,592 --> 02:14:39,872
They would rely on actual facts

2486
02:14:40,128 --> 02:14:40,896
The guide the reporting

2487
02:14:41,152 --> 02:14:41,920
As opposed to

2488
02:14:42,688 --> 02:14:43,456
To put it simply White

2489
02:14:43,712 --> 02:14:44,224
Agility

2490
02:14:44,992 --> 02:14:50,112
I've never heard Alex ever report on any of the many instances of people pushing

2491
02:14:50,368 --> 02:14:51,136
People on the train tracks

2492
02:14:52,416 --> 02:14:53,440
There are a number of them

2493
02:14:53,952 --> 02:14:54,464
He could have

2494
02:14:54,976 --> 02:14:57,024
Alex chooses dory's in Taylors is narrative

2495
02:14:58,048 --> 02:14:58,816
Purpose

2496
02:14:59,584 --> 02:15:01,120
And that is to make his white audience

2497
02:15:01,376 --> 02:15:01,888
Afraid of

2498
02:15:02,144 --> 02:15:02,656
People unlike

2499
02:15:03,168 --> 02:15:05,984
Confident that they're always in the right

2500
02:15:06,240 --> 02:15:08,800
Even if it takes lying or just making s*** up

2501
02:15:09,056 --> 02:15:09,824
Crafts that narrative

2502
02:15:10,592 --> 02:15:12,384
There's no other way for me to put this really

2503
02:15:12,640 --> 02:15:15,456
Alex Jones Show in the present-day is racist trash

2504
02:15:15,968 --> 02:15:19,552
That is trending towards increasingly violent imagery in incitement

2505
02:15:20,064 --> 02:15:21,088
He has nowhere left to go

2506
02:15:21,344 --> 02:15:22,112
To get more extreme

2507
02:15:22,368 --> 02:15:23,904
I do not think that bodes well for the

2508
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:26,208
These shows suck

2509
02:15:26,720 --> 02:15:29,024
Yep this is a bad show

2510
02:15:30,560 --> 02:15:31,072
Weird

2511
02:15:31,328 --> 02:15:32,096
To watch him

2512
02:15:32,352 --> 02:15:33,120
Try and create

2513
02:15:33,376 --> 02:15:34,144
A what about is

2514
02:15:34,912 --> 02:15:35,424
In real time

2515
02:15:36,192 --> 02:15:37,216
What you doing

2516
02:15:39,520 --> 02:15:40,544
Discussed at the very beginning

2517
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:42,336
As far as giving people

2518
02:15:43,360 --> 02:15:44,640
If somebody is like

2519
02:15:45,152 --> 02:15:47,712
If somebody goes to one of his viewers or one of his listeners

2520
02:15:47,968 --> 02:15:48,480
Susan says

2521
02:15:48,736 --> 02:15:50,784
What about all of the

2522
02:15:51,040 --> 02:15:55,136
Supremacist terrorism that you're not acknowledging ignore you

2523
02:15:55,392 --> 02:16:01,536
They'll be like what what about a woman pushing the bus

2524
02:16:01,792 --> 02:16:05,120
So there you go with it

2525
02:16:05,376 --> 02:16:06,144
To talk about

2526
02:16:06,400 --> 02:16:11,520
It's up to deal with the issues

2527
02:16:14,848 --> 02:16:16,128
I'm scouting a lot but

2528
02:16:16,896 --> 02:16:18,688
Sucks

2529
02:16:18,944 --> 02:16:20,736
It really it really really does suck

2530
02:16:20,992 --> 02:16:22,528
It's really

2531
02:16:22,784 --> 02:16:23,808
Scary

2532
02:16:24,064 --> 02:16:25,344
The potential that it has

2533
02:16:27,648 --> 02:16:28,160
Reaction to

2534
02:16:28,928 --> 02:16:30,208
Does he have Alex

2535
02:16:30,464 --> 02:16:31,488
Squid

2536
02:16:33,792 --> 02:16:35,328
Has to be an Army against the West

2537
02:16:36,864 --> 02:16:37,376
Start my wife

2538
02:16:37,888 --> 02:16:39,936
Send a conveyor being an army there

2539
02:16:40,192 --> 02:16:41,728
Come slit his throat

2540
02:16:42,240 --> 02:16:42,752
GoPro

2541
02:16:43,520 --> 02:16:44,800
I just don't think that you

2542
02:16:45,056 --> 02:16:46,336
You can talk like that without

2543
02:16:46,592 --> 02:16:48,384
Having a reasonable expectation

2544
02:16:48,640 --> 02:16:50,688
It's some of your audience is not going

2545
02:16:50,944 --> 02:16:51,456
2

2546
02:16:52,480 --> 02:16:52,992
Deal with that

2547
02:16:54,272 --> 02:16:55,296
Your audience of my

2548
02:16:55,552 --> 02:16:56,832
A I should

2549
02:16:57,856 --> 02:17:00,672
View all people of African heritage

2550
02:17:01,184 --> 02:17:01,696
Right

2551
02:17:01,952 --> 02:17:02,976
It's enforcing

2552
02:17:04,512 --> 02:17:05,792
Encouraging racism

2553
02:17:07,328 --> 02:17:08,096
A violent degree

2554
02:17:08,608 --> 02:17:09,632
Or potentially violent

2555
02:17:09,888 --> 02:17:15,264
I don't know I feel like as we go through this

2556
02:17:16,032 --> 02:17:17,312
I certainly don't know what the law

2557
02:17:17,824 --> 02:17:19,360
So I don't like to comment on that too much

2558
02:17:20,128 --> 02:17:23,200
But I think the important

2559
02:17:23,968 --> 02:17:24,992
This is what

2560
02:17:25,248 --> 02:17:26,784
He is putting out into the world

2561
02:17:27,552 --> 02:17:28,064
If things

2562
02:17:28,320 --> 02:17:28,832
Please go bad

2563
02:17:29,088 --> 02:17:30,112
Yeah

2564
02:17:30,368 --> 02:17:31,136
Just know

2565
02:17:31,392 --> 02:17:32,416
He's doing this

2566
02:17:32,928 --> 02:17:33,696
He's a part of it

2567
02:17:34,208 --> 02:17:35,744
That's the only that's the only thing I see

2568
02:17:38,560 --> 02:17:39,328
I don't know

2569
02:17:39,584 --> 02:17:40,864
I can see in and talk

2570
02:17:41,632 --> 02:17:45,472
California Student Financial Aid

2571
02:17:48,032 --> 02:17:48,800
Sure

2572
02:17:49,312 --> 02:17:50,080
Heights

2573
02:17:50,336 --> 02:17:52,640
It's like that's one of the things that I thought about with

2574
02:17:53,152 --> 02:17:53,920
Conversation of like

2575
02:17:54,944 --> 02:17:57,504
I think

2576
02:17:58,528 --> 02:17:59,552
White people are

2577
02:17:59,808 --> 02:18:00,576
Afraid

2578
02:18:00,832 --> 02:18:01,344
What they do

2579
02:18:06,208 --> 02:18:06,720
No worries

2580
02:18:07,232 --> 02:18:07,744
And

2581
02:18:09,536 --> 02:18:11,840
Alex

2582
02:18:12,096 --> 02:18:12,608
This is afraid of

2583
02:18:12,864 --> 02:18:13,632
To a certain extent

2584
02:18:13,888 --> 02:18:14,656
She knows

2585
02:18:19,008 --> 02:18:20,800
And so is real anger comes from

2586
02:18:21,056 --> 02:18:23,616
We need to defeat them otherwise we're going to get

2587
02:18:23,872 --> 02:18:25,920
He knows that he deserves guilt

2588
02:18:26,944 --> 02:18:28,992
To feel guilt

2589
02:18:29,504 --> 02:18:30,016
2

2590
02:18:31,296 --> 02:18:32,576
It's

2591
02:18:33,600 --> 02:18:34,624
It's unfortunate because

2592
02:18:34,880 --> 02:18:35,904
Completely Blocks office

2593
02:18:38,464 --> 02:18:41,024
Entire pack of bacon

2594
02:18:42,304 --> 02:18:43,840
The present and the future don't have to

2595
02:18:44,096 --> 02:18:44,864
Tamir the path

2596
02:18:45,376 --> 02:18:46,144
There's a

2597
02:18:46,400 --> 02:18:47,424
Positive world's week

2598
02:18:48,448 --> 02:18:48,960
Towards

2599
02:18:49,472 --> 02:18:50,752
That doesn't

2600
02:18:51,264 --> 02:18:51,776
Involved

2601
02:18:54,080 --> 02:18:55,104
Involved

2602
02:18:55,360 --> 02:18:56,896
Curing tribalism with

2603
02:18:57,152 --> 02:18:58,688
Appeals to Jesus

2604
02:18:58,944 --> 02:18:59,968
The free market

2605
02:19:00,224 --> 02:19:01,248
Pictures of love so much

2606
02:19:01,760 --> 02:19:03,040
There's a there's a possible

2607
02:19:03,808 --> 02:19:04,832
Better Way Forward now

2608
02:19:05,344 --> 02:19:06,112
Just closed off to it

2609
02:19:07,648 --> 02:19:10,720
Destructive

2610
02:19:10,976 --> 02:19:12,000
It has to make you

2611
02:19:12,768 --> 02:19:13,536
Miserable

2612
02:19:14,304 --> 02:19:16,096
And you don't even know you can't even

2613
02:19:17,376 --> 02:19:23,520
Because what you think is making Wells

2614
02:19:25,312 --> 02:19:30,688
You can't do it on the radio on the radio so long as you ascribe it to

2615
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:35,296
Yeah well the one

2616
02:19:35,552 --> 02:19:37,344
If you ascribe it to yourself

2617
02:19:37,600 --> 02:19:38,112
You can't expect

2618
02:19:38,368 --> 02:19:41,440
Continue to make 1/8 cup

2619
02:19:42,464 --> 02:19:44,000
So I don't know I think you show sucks

2620
02:19:49,120 --> 02:19:50,144
On Friday

2621
02:19:50,400 --> 02:19:50,912
That's the plan

2622
02:19:51,168 --> 02:19:51,936
With another

2623
02:19:52,192 --> 02:19:53,216
Adventure

2624
02:19:53,472 --> 02:19:55,008
Stupid stupid world

2625
02:19:55,264 --> 02:19:59,104
Website

2626
02:19:59,616 --> 02:20:05,760
Iran Twitter we're also

2627
02:20:06,016 --> 02:20:08,576
On Facebook you if you wanted to

2628
02:20:08,832 --> 02:20:09,344
Download r-pod

2629
02:20:09,856 --> 02:20:10,624
Or share it with

2630
02:20:11,392 --> 02:20:11,904
What you should

2631
02:20:12,160 --> 02:20:13,184
To do

2632
02:20:13,440 --> 02:20:14,976
Is downloaded onto your phone

2633
02:20:15,744 --> 02:20:17,024
Leave your phone unlocked

2634
02:20:17,536 --> 02:20:18,560
And in a very public

2635
02:20:19,584 --> 02:20:20,608
And have it always playing

2636
02:20:21,120 --> 02:20:21,888
And people will eventually

2637
02:20:22,400 --> 02:20:22,912
That sounds right

2638
02:20:23,168 --> 02:20:25,472
I think that's the best strategy

2639
02:20:25,984 --> 02:20:28,544
What about their absolute

2640
02:20:35,200 --> 02:20:36,480
Tractor people are not

2641
02:20:36,992 --> 02:20:41,088
That's not true

2642
02:20:41,856 --> 02:20:42,624
I meant the

2643
02:20:43,648 --> 02:20:46,464
Chimeras

2644
02:20:46,720 --> 02:20:50,560
Who are tractor they are not at their house

2645
02:20:50,816 --> 02:20:53,888
I don't think we're far less enough

2646
02:20:55,168 --> 02:20:56,704
They are

2647
02:21:02,592 --> 02:21:04,640
So I come back

2648
02:21:04,896 --> 02:21:11,040
$12,000

2649
02:21:11,296 --> 02:21:14,112
Dollars for lecture

2650
02:21:14,368 --> 02:21:16,416
But one guy

2651
02:21:16,928 --> 02:21:17,440
Is Alex Jones

2652
02:21:22,304 --> 02:21:25,888
Alex
