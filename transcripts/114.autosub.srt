00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:45,056
Around

Is knowledge fight

6
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,624
I guess we like sit around and talk a little bit that's pretty much what

7
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,672
For the last time

8
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,208
2017

00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:02,976

00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:14,752
And some beers and some

14
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:25,248
Might have argued about big fish

15
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:29,856
Coming out on New Year's Eve

16
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:33,952
We're going to count it down

17
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:37,280
The best thing to do is play this playlist

18
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,048

Polly

31
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:22,080
We got an interesting

32
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:28,736
Episode

33
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:32,832
Klipsch sure very interested in one clip

34
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,600
Okay

35
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:40,000
You did tell me that before the show and I still kind of don't believe actually I lied a little but

36
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:44,608
Investigation episodes

37
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,632
In February

38
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,472
The path of Alex Jones

39
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,752
Takeoff

40
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,384
And so I kept looking

41
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,152
I kept digging

42
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,712
On

43
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:03,040
On the day after what we covered so be like February

44
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,320
24th

45
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,136
The entire show is about Piers Morgan

46
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:11,488
Years after he went on Piers Morgan show

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,560
What's 8

48
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,352
He just goes off on this life

49
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:22,752
F*** off. Morgan you got fired suck it is just real agree without

50
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:29,152
No cuz I don't have clips of that episode it's so boring

51
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:35,040
Oh well it's just him gloating and being like some beers I win

52
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,088
Ryan

53
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:41,440
I don't disagree with that entirely at all

54
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:43,488
There wasn't much really to go on

55
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:49,888
It means episode on the 24th

56
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,936
I have millions of fans

57
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,264
I think is kind of in

58
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,312
Add the little bit of light on Alex's

59
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,104
Self-made passed

60
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,920
Clip that I have for February

61
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,992
Time Warner

62
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:08,064
AOL hundred billion dollar company

63
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:19,071
$20,000 on the first luckily got a local radio show

64
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:27,263
Nothing nothing

65
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,823
Nothing everybody has access

66
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,103
$20,000 loan

67
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,407
He had nothing

68
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,967
He pulled himself up by his Rich that bootstrap

69
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:39,295
Perfectly clear

70
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:44,415
I don't really think there's anything super native about getting help and I don't think that Alex

71
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,183
Is wrong

72
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:45,951
I've gotten help

73
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,975
Anything like that

74
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,279
It's wrong for him not to recognize

75
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:52,863
The position that you would lucky enough to be in

76
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,911
Came from nothing

77
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,191
Is such

78
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:56,959
Bulshit

79
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:03,359
Yeah cuz the amount of money your parents have to have a second just drop 20 grand

80
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,127
Is ridiculous

81
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:08,479
Broadcast out of a property that was owned by his dad

82
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,527
Like an office building at his dad owned

83
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,855
And his first

84
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,903
To get a radio show so like all of these

85
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,695
Not wrong

86
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,023
Stupid

87
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,303
Anyway

88
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:23,839
It's not like I said

89
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,375
It's all shooting

90
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,935
He was an orphan I would have been

91
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:28,703
Totally fine

92
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,519
If he says he came from nothing into you

93
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,823
No parents

94
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,615
I'm on board

95
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,639
Much more reason

96
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,479
There's one there's one part that's really funny

97
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,759
And I I don't

98
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:42,783
I'm trying to find

99
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,063
Clip and I can't find it

100
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:44,831
Explain it

101
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:47,391
There's a whole thing

102
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:51,999
They offered me every TV show in the world

103
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:52,767
And everything

104
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,815
Before they gave it to Joe Rogan

105
00:05:55,071 --> 00:06:01,215
They wanted me to host Jessica Ferrell

106
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:12,223
And I know for a fact that from 2008

107
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:16,319
Alex has Jesse on when they're about

108
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,855
To start filming

109
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,135
And he's basically just like

110
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,159
Bagan Jeffy

111
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,183
His co-host

112
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:26,303
He looked like I don't know how funny would it be if I was like

113
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:31,423
I wish I had find the clips but for now I just wanted to point out like

114
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,727
Feeling like a real

115
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,751
Sucking like

116
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,311
On top of the world headspace

117
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:41,663
Why was listening to it I know he was almost Chandler Bing

118
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,503
He's going to be in friends was also almost

119
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,807
Both roll

120
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,599
Great Haircuts

121
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,695
Can you imagine all the girls going

122
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,719
Cody Wild

123
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:57,535
I was listening to this episode

124
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,607
Complain about Piers Morgan the whole time I agree with you

125
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,375
Yeah

126
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:07,775
I realized it I don't know if I've ever listened to the entire Piers Morgan

127
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:12,383
Are we listening to the entire Piers Morgan interview oh yeah we are

128
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,015
13 minutes

129
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,807
I realize that most people

130
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,599
That would be great episode if we just

131
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,879
Play that and then

132
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,439
Happy New Year guys and that was that we just called

133
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,207
It's

134
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,999
One of these things where like

135
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,279
It's stupid

136
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:33,887
And you don't like Piers Morgan to begin with

137
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,191
Buckhead

138
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:40,031
Whatever you think about the person who's interviewing him

139
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,639
Heads or whatever people are like

140
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,967
People ask me if I would like

141
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:48,735
Interview Ali

142
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,807
And it's it's things like this that we're going to be going over with

143
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,599
Is why my answer is

144
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,903
Categorically know who never wanted

145
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:59,999
Even if you have a command of fact he's never going to let you play the game

146
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,279
That you want to play

147
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,607
This is from

148
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,911
January 7th 2030

149
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,447
Alex Jones

150
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,471
Went on

151
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,239
Piers Morgan

152
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,007
Show

153
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,311
And made the rounds

154
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:16,383
Afterwards viral

155
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,175
He was still on the BBC at the

156
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:22,015
Alex Jones

157
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,319
Morgan was on

158
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:29,951
Alex Jones went on his show and was like

159
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:33,023
Oh man we were being followed all around New York

160
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:33,791
They're people too

161
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,327
Gang stalking

162
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,519
There was s*** all over the bathroom walls

163
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:48,383
I don't know about that

164
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,943
Cooperation

165
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:57,343
On the bathroom walls

166
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,391
And I'm not saying like 8.

167
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:02,975
He's saying it's on the bathroom

168
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,255
He creates like a really a

169
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,535
Christine

170
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,303
Sort of

171
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,327
Cover story

172
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,607
What is trip

173
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,167
Just mythologizing

174
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:17,055
They had to have gangstalkers follow me around talking to their sleeves

175
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:21,919
Like it some kind of cartoon it wasn't just like regular people

176
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,711
Stocking

177
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:26,527
BFDI

178
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:38,815
I like three times

179
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:41,631
Because of his gaze

180
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:48,031
I feel like you're disinclined

181
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,103
To enjoy this

182
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:55,711
I'm on board the Big Clip

183
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,735
Screaming at him 17

184
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:59,807
1876 will commence again if you try and take our guns

185
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,855
No I did not know that

186
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,135
I've never seen this

187
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:07,231
Like when we started this podcast nothing about alley

188
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:11,583
I'm not allowed to look up Alex

189
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,423
It has to be

190
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,471
Something that you introduced

191
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,239
Otherwise I

192
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,263
Not know anything about

193
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,847
Because important

194
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,615
Is mythology

195
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,383
Important piece of

196
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,407
His story

197
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,015
And it's really expensive where he broke through a lot more

198
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,295
He had before

199
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,599
Like he gained a lot of notoriety

200
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,135
A lot of promise

201
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:35,903
After this

202
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,439
Because you made a f****** ass

203
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:39,743
And soaked

204
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,047
Going to jump

205
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,607
And I

206
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,399
Hit me with the high sign

207
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,959
Piers Morgan and Alex Jones

208
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,311

216
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,655
Piers Morgan is sucking

217
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:22,751
As a means of

218
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:29,151
Introducing Alex

219
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:29,919
Cool thing to do

220
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,455
What

221
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,759
Years of effort

222
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,039
Years of training in

223
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:39,391
Preparation to get all the way to the whitehouse.gov website

224
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,183
Put a petition

225
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,975

00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:48,607
100000 people or something

227
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:53,471
104 thousand people assigned

228
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,239
Find Abbott

229
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,031
Station Alex Jones yesterday

230
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,567
Alex Jones Show

231
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,407
Starts off

232
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,943
Starsoft

233
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,967
Let's see how long

234
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,735
Either find text

235
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:17,535
That we have all these farmers and the Russian government official Chinese government

236
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,007
That this is globalism

237
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:32,639
Hanover

238
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,503
Swish

239
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,095
You know what I don't really I don't really have

240
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,703
Say more about that

241
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,751
Irene

242
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:05,151
Don't don't get me wrong I ice Doug Taylor

243
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,687
But there is a good point

244
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,479
Militarization

245
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:19,231
For your gun will now you're making gun.

246
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:22,815
You can come when the police come for your guns

247
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:28,703
Back at the dorm you're starting 2018 full-on militia sympathizer

248
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,335
Careful

249
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,615
I'm saying is Maybe

250
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,895
Bread lightly friend

251
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,431
Not the worst idea

252
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:42,015
In the world I don't know

253
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:44,575
We it look

254
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,343
It progressed

255
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,623
All got together

256
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,671
And just bought a lot of guns

257
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:56,095
I think that'll be fine communist

258
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,631
I've never admired David koresh

259
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,215
That's makes you and Alex different

260
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:07,615
I would say that it's important to point out those are the things that he's described

261
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,407
Specifically like

262
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:15,807
Jade Helm adjacent narrative

263
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:20,415
Yeah yeah yeah

264
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:23,231
It's all that it's all that

265
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:29,631
They're so that's I don't think I like that the Swiss get a shout-out don't think the Swiss and the Americans are the only people allowed

266
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:33,727
How to have gun

267
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:40,127
I don't know that everybody like most countries

268
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:40,895
Where it's like

269
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,919
Everybody has a gun

270
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,199
There a lot of country

271
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:50,367
I just because a couple of them have been remarkably successful

272
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:54,463
And I curtailing gun ownership and gun violence

273
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,743
It doesn't mean that there aren't

274
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:56,767
30 still

275
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,095
I don't want to do

276
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,751
The Second Amendment isn't there

277
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,799
4

278
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:09,823
Protect

279
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:23,903
I don't recall part of the second amendment being about

280
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,975
I don't know I don't remember George

281
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,999
Being like

282
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,047
We can't allow British

283
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,071
People to be quartered

284
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,607
Right

285
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,375
Street thugs

286
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:39,775
Little do you know that there is a provision in the Second Amendment about the knockout game

287
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:44,639
I mean

288
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,431
Spent like

289
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,455
Variability

290
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,759
To protect your property and stuff like that

291
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,831
I get the application that Alex would make their butt

292
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,367
I mean

293
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:57,183
Close

294
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,023
Zimmerman I think that there is there is code

295
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,095
Announce

296
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,655
George Zimmerman was railroaded

297
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,935
Your other is like

298
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:11,775
He doesn't fix it

299
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,823
We did not agree with the mainstream

300
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,383
Perception of George Zimmerman's website

301
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,151
Yeah

302
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:21,759
Getting into the idea of there being a lot of rape

303
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:27,135
Very much water deposit before

304
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,415
Secure that so here we go

305
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,439
Jumping back in

306
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:37,119
Because the police

307
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:46,847
20 + 4 Prime drop in

308
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:50,175
Means

309
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:53,503
16 years ago

310
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,343
Not true either

311
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,999
Mystics is as we know that much more

312
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:08,607
In-depth study was done by a lot of

313
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,215
A lot more crime there's an increase in violent crime

314
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,239
The parallel course

315
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,519
Everybody has guns

316
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,543
Right right

317
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:43,423
For example

318
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:59,807
The Republic

319
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,087
So

320
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:05,183
You know that's that's really him working himself into a friend

321
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,719
The Republic will rise

322
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,023
If you try to take

323
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,559
So the Republic

324
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,375
What is the Republic

325
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,679
Doesn't it doesn't A-Team

326
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,447
I like

327
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:20,287
Counterintuitive it requires somebody to take the gun

328
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,823
Before the Republic Rises

329
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:25,663
What is an interesting light bulb what are they what are we doing right now as far as

330
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,455
The Republic goes are we like hey

331
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,247
As long as I got my guns

332
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:33,343
I don't care if this f****** Republic Valderrama

333
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,879
Just stroking a f******

334
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:40,511
The idea that I think Alex and a lot of people like

335
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,791
Kim have that is

336
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,327
The guns are the only thing

337
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,095
That matters

338
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:50,495
And so yeah absolutely

339
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,031
In their conception

340
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,335
Which is not

341
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,247
What are you saying

342
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,367
Confederate Circle

343
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,135
He is royalty

344
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:10,207
Which actually comes into play it right about now

345
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:17,119
Dwyane Wade

346
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:20,447
My family was at the core of both sides

347
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:24,799
Does that mean

348
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:29,151
My family was the winner and the loser of the Santa Ana battle

349
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,175
What

350
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:33,247
My family started that

351
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,527
Right

352
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:38,367
People over there

353
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:44,767
My family are agent provocateurs from the Texas Revolution days we have always been gun

354
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:45,535
Runners

355
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:51,935
I mean will I make more money on guns then you got like my family was involved in the Texas

356
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:58,335
Revolution in Santa Ana related to David Bedford Forrest and related to The Tudors

357
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,919
He was Cleopatra in a former life

358
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:04,991
Roleplay

359
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,551
He's LARPing as Alex Jones

360
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:24,703
I would I would point out that the show is taped in New York so he's already

361
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:26,751
Now there's bad

362
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:30,847
Can you only become an American

363
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:31,615
Go to app

364
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,663
Is that part of the citizen

365
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:43,647
Boy boy so counterintuitive

366
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,183
He hates immigrants so much

367
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:50,047
That goes back to the

368
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:53,887
Depositing earlier that we sort of skipped over a little bit

369
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:56,447
His ideas are the women in India wanting gun

370
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:59,519
Okay I mean they should be able to protect

371
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:03,359
Themselves absolutely put the bigger issue is the people who are doing the rape

372
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:09,759
Seems like the larger issue over them having guns

373
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:13,087
A lot of interest in talking about

374
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,391
We only give women

375
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,672
Okay

376
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,952
Fine

377
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,232
Move Along

378
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:21,792
He finished

379
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:28,192
Yes I am finished

380
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:53,024
I don't know

381
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,304
You just hurt his

382
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,120
You want to cut that off.

383
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:57,888
Anytime you

384
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:04,544
Constant looking off camera like approval we like

385
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,968
I don't want

386
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,272
So

387
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,976
How many gun murders were there in America lost

388
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:29,376
Most remarkable things that you

389
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,656
Come away at I mean

390
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,424
I still don't like

391
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,192
Piers Morgan

392
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:34,240
Listen to this

393
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:37,056
And it's not because I don't like Alex I'm on his side

394
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,080
Because he's just trying to

395
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,104
Call Dad

396
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,896
Calm down

397
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:44,224
Why would you

398
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,784
Why would you have Alex Jones on your show

399
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:49,344
If you don't know what Alex Jones is going

400
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,368
To do on your

401
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,160
To be fair I think that is

402
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,440
I think he knew

403
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:57,792
Whole reason they booked out

404
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:58,816
Right

405
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,608
For millions of people to watch this

406
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,376
Be like

407
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,752
And it got like after Alex leaves in the next segment Alan dershowitz on

408
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:13,152
Marriott

409
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,688
Amanda Piper

410
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:17,504
Conversation about how like Alex Jones

411
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,272
Jesus

412
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,832
Important for why people shouldn't have done

413
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:23,904
And so there is a little bit of like I think they were trying

414
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,440
To trap him a little

415
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,768
But at the same time you can see a bargain

416
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:33,376
12

417
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:36,704
How to do a child's violin

418
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,496
Bud Draper

419
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,104
The correct amount of

420
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,384
Spoiler alert

421
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,968
VR

422
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:48,736
Whatever

423
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:57,696
Many gun murders

424
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,464
Is there are

425
00:23:58,976 --> 00:23:59,744
America

426
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:22,784
How many people

427
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:27,136
Weather in Brentwood

428
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:30,208
How many gun murders

429
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,352
Alex has

430
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:40,448
Like that's a nice little dick move right there I figured you'd prepare for this

431
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,984
I've never prepared for any

432
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,288
Alex has like maybe 6

433
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,312
Pieces of loose

434
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:48,384
Paper

435
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,808
I almost couldn't write a funny or so

436
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:59,392
Right

437
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:05,024
So performative you can tell he doesn't he's not the only arguments he has

438
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,840
Reflections like what

439
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:14,240
What about staph infections at hospitals what doing what about all day

440
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,008
Because

441
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,288
What about

442
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,568
Staph infection

443
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:22,432
Yes there are regulations about Queen and Hospital like people

444
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:26,272
People work really hard to limit the the infections

445
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,808
But you can be exposed to

446
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,088
In a hospital

447
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,416
Well

448
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,208
Apply

449
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,280
Necessitate

450
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,304
Regulation

451
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,656
Images that are caused by a gun regulations

452
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:44,960
That tyranny and then you know what

453
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:47,008
I don't want any Hospital regulation

454
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:49,312
And either

455
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,592
Issue if you

456
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:54,176
Hospital infections

457
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:02,624
I agree I agree we need some mental Revolution people try and stop us from getting

458
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:06,208
Try and limit my access to

459
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,232
Great white shark

460
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:14,912
Where would you like the regulations to stop with great white shark

461
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:20,800
I want to come over regulation want to roll it back

462
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:24,384
If you want you're an adult you're an American

463
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,920
You ever god-given right it's

464
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:33,088
Third amendment to we're having a bunch

465
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,368
Well here's what I would think

466
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:37,696
Constitution

467
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,584
Absolutely

468
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:48,960
You are not there you are not legally obligated however

469
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,240
2 house

470
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,008
Is a British

471
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,032
Great white shark

472
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:52,800
Now.

473
00:26:57,408 --> 00:27:01,248
Loud noise

474
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:07,392
Lower

475
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:13,536
Not

476
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,560
Doing a good job

477
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:19,936
But like I said I clearly thrown off a little bit of it is intentional to use him as a prop later

478
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,472
I think there is

479
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:24,032
And God bless him for it cuz I mean you know

480
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,824
When you had someone with Alex it is

481
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,360
Probably the best actor

482
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,384
Victor just let him playing

483
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,920
I meant just hope

484
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,200
Everyone is watching

485
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,480
See through it and see like

486
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:33,504
This guy is

487
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:34,528
Unhinged

488
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,296
He's crazy

489
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:39,392
He doesn't actually know any of the statistics

490
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,928
Does Pierce do a lot of camera takes

491
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:44,512
A couple

492
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:50,912
Zack from Saved by the Bell at where he's like okay pause

493
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,728
And then and then they go right back to it

494
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:56,288
Timeout

495
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,336
I would have I would have if I

496
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:01,408
What's the sketch that I was directing

497
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:06,016
Turn off scenery

498
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:08,320
Little Slugger

499
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:23,936
That's on the front that's on Sergeant Pepper's Lonely

500
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:29,312
Jolly Old Queen comes out with a decree you will be arrested If you defend yourself

501
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,336
Especially

502
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,616
If you are an old lady

503
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:35,456
Everyday I want an old lady's brain food

504
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,064
This is the cost of not having guns and we love it

505
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:43,648
People burning down buildings and beating up old women

506
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:44,416
Train

507
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,184
Street thugs

508
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,232
Swimming everyday of the week

509
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:53,120
Resume that street thugs are responsible for beating within the old women to death every day

510
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,728
This is one of the least advertised

511
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:58,496
Things about Brett

512
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,544
Constant old lady Thunder

00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,872
Hunger Games

514
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:07,456
Mix

515
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:11,040
It's a movie I do all the 80s movie about killing old people

516
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:17,184
Hunger Games

517
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,976
Scanners the movie that you were thinking about

518
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:58,912
What world did Piers Morgan

519
00:29:59,168 --> 00:29:59,680
He's a tough guy

520
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:02,752
None

521
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,824
Logan's Run

522
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,360
Jesus alright

523
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,224
Presented now

524
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,040
Is the Piers Morgan wanted to beat him up

525
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,856
You're very clearly he's like

526
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:18,624
Hey

527
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,696
How about I come back and we fighting

528
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,096

Approve something

530
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:38,592
I do love the idea though of it there but what

531
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:39,360
Subduing

532
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,408
How about you come back

533
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,456
Boxing ring

All wearing American flag you are Union

535
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,344
Responsibility

536
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,648
Okay

537
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:57,280
You were right in a lot of

538
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,328
Tremendous way

539
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,424
I really like seeing this kind of misery on someone

540
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,984
That I don't like

541
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:06,752
Stop

G35

546
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,864
Bowser

547
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,544
No one wants to ban

548
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,312
Knives

549
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:45,408
That's that's a gross Miss representation

550
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:49,504
They want to do they want to use their hands

551
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,552
I asked you this

552
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,320
Sir

553
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:55,392

00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:05,120
The same thing has to be done with bread

You can't fly spray

560
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:07,936
Giant sandwich

561
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:10,496

00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,512
Punching to the Moon

575
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,328
Like as opposed to having today

576
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:39,168
And I would imagine those my the first time I've ever wanted

577
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:39,936
Doobie Wolverine

578
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:44,800
Pretty sure you can even have those in Britain

579
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,432
Let's move our back in the Wolverine is the only superhero I can pick up who is total

580
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,248
What about Rogue

581
00:32:55,296 --> 00:33:01,440
She's like all of them are street legal

582
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,840
It's not illegal to touch somebody

583
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,400
I don't think

584
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,448
The book

585
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:17,568
I think I think that we will have a drastically redefined

586
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:22,432
Definition of scrutiny

587
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:24,480
Public Storage

588
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:30,624
Do you want to spend

589
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,744
Yes

590
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:42,144
Semi-autos

591
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:48,032
Okay almost aren't even coming

592
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:52,640
Which weapon

593
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:55,200
Predominantly used in the Aurora movie theater shooting

594
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:04,416
Yeah okay

595
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,184
Alright

596
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,024
This is this is why.

597
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:12,096
I think he's trying though

598
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:12,864
He's

599
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,144
He had no idea

600
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:14,912
Or at least

601
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,472
What you going up

602
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:20,032
The idea of

603
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:21,056
Coming at Alex

604
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:21,824
Something

605
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,360
Look at these two things

606
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,384
Is silly

607
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,664
Alex news

608
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,944
That there are two things

609
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:27,712
And he's going

610
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:28,992
To make it a million

611
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:31,040
So any argument

612
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,064
Where's Morgan has

613
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:32,832
Is

614
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:33,856
Purely dilute

615
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:35,392
Yeah

616
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:38,464
Really to dance with him

617
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:39,488
Like

618
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:44,352
Prepare to deal with diversion you can't really get a central thesis

619
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:47,424
But at the same time.

620
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,704
Devastating if Alex

621
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,008
Engaged with it but he's just not going to

622
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,032
Well I mean

623
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,568
The issue

624
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,128
The issue with

625
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:56,896
Piers Morgan

626
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:00,480
You built he's trying to do this whole build thing

627
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,272
Here is an interesting fact

628
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:07,392
Another fact

629
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:10,208
You can't build an argument with

630
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:13,280
You have to do is

631
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,328
Bright

632
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:17,888
We're relatively

633
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:20,960
Ballistic boxing match for truth

634
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:23,008
Actual and I don't think they would

635
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,032
You should wear the Union

636
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:25,824
Don't really feel.

637
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:28,384
You should have to wear the queen

638
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:31,712
The actual Queen also I think

639
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:37,600
This is just fun because we on our last episode from 2014

640
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,904
We had the guy call in to be like

641
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,952
You said you wanted a box Piers Morgan

642
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:47,840
Alex is super confused now he trying to have a little bit of a context for why that was the case

643
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:49,376
Anyway

644
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,680
The single biggest

645
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:54,240
Shooting in the history of American Sons

646
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:57,312
People hit by shooter

647
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:05,248
Alex's legit just denying reality

648
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,784
At this point

649
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,112
Statistically true as of 2014

650
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,904
Terms of shooting

651
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:13,184
And I was like

652
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,488
No that's not it

653
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,768
That's not even

654
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:17,792
Unique

655
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:18,560
Anymore

656
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:19,584
Plano

657
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,376
Any interview

658
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:27,264
Interview with one of those people hard right people is always going to be like them

659
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:30,080
Who's ahead of the game

660
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:32,384
This was the single

661
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,152
Biggest

662
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:34,688
Mass shooting

663
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:50,816
Oregon Shopping Mall

664
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:54,400
I understand

665
00:36:54,656 --> 00:37:00,800
Terminally ill

666
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,432
Answer the question

667
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,552
He's not going to but

668
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,600
Sometimes it makes a fair point

669
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:16,416
Generally speaking

670
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:19,232
With the idea that just because there's criminals you don't

671
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,256
Get punished for it

672
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:22,048
Fresh thyme

673
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:22,816
You're right

674
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:24,864
Contingent on living in

675
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,168
Society Society

676
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:29,728
One way it wants to operate

677
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:31,776
What you would prefer to do

678
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:35,616
Sorry about what about like

679
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:37,152
Vnsa in the picture

680
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:40,992
The ideas because we have terrorists

681
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,272
We're going to

682
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,808
Remove people's rights

683
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:46,368
I agree with that

684
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:50,464
Just because there are criminals

685
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:54,048
Semi automatic

686
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:56,352
Doesn't mean we shouldn't all have

687
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,912
Video game

688
00:37:59,168 --> 00:37:59,936
First of all

689
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:01,216
Cuz I mean

690
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:05,568
Like you know I've been playing Skyrim and I can't tell you how many people I've cut down with a flame

691
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:07,616
Sword in real life

692
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:10,176
What's crazy

693
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,456
Flaming swords

694
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:17,344
Dawn

695
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:20,672
Flaming sword

696
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:21,696
Jurassic

697
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:25,536
Can we can we go over this point at nauseam but the idea that he's blaming

698
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:28,096
Serotonin reuptake inhibitors

699
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:29,376
Like

700
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,144
Psychoactive

701
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,680
Drugs

702
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:33,216
A dangerous precedent

703
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:33,984
Decide because

704
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,264
With

705
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,032
You would see

706
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:37,312
Much more

707
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:38,336
Violin

708
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,616
Most likely

709
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:42,432
People on medication

710
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:47,808
If they had

711
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:48,832
Some sort of access

712
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:49,600
To medication

713
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,648
Maybe we have a difference

714
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,416
Conversation about

715
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:54,720
X I don't know

716
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:55,488
I don't know

717
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,512
Supposed to taste

718
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,816
Generally speaking a lot of the time

719
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,352
People who are on

720
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,120
Psychoactive

721
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:01,888
Medication

722
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,568
When you see the people who commit suicide

723
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:11,616
Generally I have fallen off

724
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:12,384
The medic

725
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,176
So

726
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,272
Now that's that's in that's another good

727
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,040
To have is

728
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:21,344
Another good

729
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,112
To have it is

730
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:24,416
How effective are they

731
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,184
AR with

732
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,976
Drawls are worse than

733
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,024
Conversation

734
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:47,968
Answer my question

735
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:53,088
So that

736
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:56,160
Commercial with him just a gallon

737
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:58,208
The moment he realizes they're commercially

738
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,792
Pierce we're doing a great job

739
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:04,608
Yeah like that British shower

740
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:11,776
You know I take issue with the idea of

741
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:13,056
Reality

742
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,848
Statistics being referred to as

743
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:15,872
Factoids

744
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:20,224
In a in a dismissive because Morgan is doing it like you

745
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,248
Sandwiches

746
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,272
The losers strategy

747
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,576
He's laying out

748
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,392
Like building blocks of an

749
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:29,696
Using statistics studies facts

750
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:30,464
Alex

751
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,120
Oh yeah you have this crime statistics

752
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:40,960
What it what are we doing we're just going back and forth with

753
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:45,568
With stats on each other

754
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:46,336
To talk about that

755
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,872
I just don't talk anymore

756
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,920
Did you know that

757
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:51,200
90% of horses

758
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:58,112
Commercial

759
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,904
Kick him off

760
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:03,744
Herobrine producers like this is gold

761
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:06,048
Real baby

762
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,800
I need somebody done to you

763
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:17,824
I'm going to ask you some

764
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,592
Question

765
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:21,408
This is not

766
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,688
You already bought

767
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:29,600
Not a good strategy to deal with

768
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:33,184
You never like with someone who has such an

769
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,464
Defiant stance

770
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,232
Redlyfe

771
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,280
You don't approach them with like

772
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,560
Here's the deal

773
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:41,120
Here's what we're going to do

774
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,400
Belgrade

775
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,168
Is the

776
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:46,240
The show supposed to be

777
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:51,616
Yeah it's not really respecting the social contract except

778
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:57,247
What's fascinating about this

779
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,015
Is this is

780
00:41:58,527 --> 00:41:59,551
Exactly like whenever he

781
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:01,087
He plays a video on a show

782
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,903
We're going to have to restart

783
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:10,303
Because I can't handle this piece of s***

784
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,327
You would totally do that

785
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:16,959
In the spirit of the property

786
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:20,799
What's the question

787
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:34,623
He's he's mad that you're Morgan has notecards you're hosting the gel you're bringing that little

788
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:36,159
A note

789
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:39,743
Why don't you have hair

790
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,023
Right right right

791
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,327
I mean I know Alex's

792
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:45,375
Obsessed with the idea of like being off

793
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:47,679
Teleprompters and stuff like that

794
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:51,519
I don't know why he's so triggered by the idea that he has no cards

795
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:53,567
It's the difference

796
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:55,103
Between a professional operation

797
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:58,431
Extemporaneous nonsense

798
00:42:58,687 --> 00:42:59,711
Off the top of the head

799
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:02,015
It's weird

800
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:05,087
What equipment we don't have no cards

801
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:06,879
What happens if you should respect

802
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:07,647
He's switch

803
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:08,415
From

804
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,207
A switch

805
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:10,975
From being like

806
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:14,559
To being calm

807
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,863
Immediately like

808
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,911
No matter how

809
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:20,959
Little nationalist you are

810
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:22,751
There's something American

811
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:25,823
About hating a guy a British guy condescending

812
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:29,919
That's quintessentially built into America like

813
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,967
One Spears did that I was like

814
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:35,295
Go get him Alex like I don't know what happened I don't know what happen

815
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:39,135
He's very satisfied by what

816
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:45,535
Violent crime

817
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:04,479
I don't know in the in the show

818
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:06,015
They're probably should

819
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:11,647
There's so many bodyguards on his set

820
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:18,559
Videos about like we try to take away our guns

821
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:23,679
I don't know if there's more

822
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:26,239
Has bodyguards but I would assume a lot of numbers

823
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:27,263
Security guards

824
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,031
Christian

825
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:32,639
Bodyguards for sale

826
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:33,663
Anything like that

827
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:35,967
It's a dumb argument

828
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,087
Because people who are

829
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,111
Security guard

830
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,391
Regina really

831
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,415
License

832
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,183
You know

833
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:49,791
That's a good point though other than Powers cop

834
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:51,583
If we do get rid of guns

835
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,375
Maybe we won't need bodyguards

836
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:55,167
We're not creating jobs

837
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:57,471
Tell that to the old ladies in England

838
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:01,823
They need bodyguards

839
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:02,847
Certainly

840
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:09,503
Create a robust economy around old lady security guards

841
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:11,551
Retirement age nonsense

842
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:13,599
Protect us

843
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:14,623
Alright

844
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:41,503
It is always

845
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:42,271
Sandy Hook

846
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:01,983
Great Point Alex

847
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:07,615
Rhetoric

848
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:10,687
M3 route

849
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:14,783
Rhetoric

850
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,575
Is trying to employ is

851
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:22,975
Beating back against Alex's argument that

852
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:25,023
I was just trying to bring up the

853
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:26,047
Large

854
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,071
Shooting

855
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:32,191
Generally are automatic weapons which undercuts

856
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:34,495
Which undercuts the argument that most

857
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:39,103
Shootings

858
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,639
What have you

859
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:43,199
Statistically but those are

860
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:43,967
Whataburger

861
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:45,247
As opposed to

862
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:46,527
30

863
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:50,623
Whatever it's it's hard it's hard to hurt

864
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:51,391
Kill people with

865
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:54,463
I think it's not that hard

866
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:56,255
I've never tried

867
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,839
Like it you you can't

868
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:00,607
It's like there's

869
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:02,399
They need they tell you to shoot

870
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,167
Center Mass

871
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:07,263
And all of that s*** is not how they trained cops no idea

872
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:09,055
Probably

873
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:16,223
Pretty pretty stoked about that proud of you

874
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:18,527
A surprising number of gunshot

875
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:23,903
Shooting you back

876
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:25,695
Rat you fly backwards

877
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,279
Be that as it may

878
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:31,583
I think more often than not

879
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,119
You find black people get lucky

880
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:35,423
Yeah I don't I don't know man

881
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:36,959
I don't care that's not a

882
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:42,079
Really no it's not

883
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:44,895
Do you understand what I'm getting at

884
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:46,175
These large-scale trash

885
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:46,943
These are the ones

886
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:47,711
Always

887
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:50,783
Seem to use automatic weapons semi-automatic weapons

888
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:52,831
And that's the reason that there is an issue

889
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:54,367
That's the reason why people

890
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,903
The problem with what.

891
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:57,183
Stewing is that

892
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:59,743
He needs to have realized by now

893
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:00,767
Yes

894
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:02,559
Alex doesn't understand

895
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:04,607
Why

896
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,911
What are you thinking

897
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:10,495
You understand

898
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:17,663
Type of weapon

899
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:18,431
Open was used

900
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:24,831
Velocity

901
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:39,423
Vin Diesel

902
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:41,983
Being rude I'm trying to be civil

903
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:44,543
Some of the question

904
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:49,151
Why do people need civilian

905
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:50,175
Need an alpha

906
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:50,943
15 time

907
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:21,919
Don't understand it

908
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:24,479
Set alarm clock

909
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:25,247
I believe

910
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:27,551
Explaining

911
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,647
Play

912
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:35,999
If you don't understand it I'll lay it out as best I can

913
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:37,791
From from what

914
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:40,095
His point is that

915
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:41,887
Because the media

916
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:42,911
Sensationalizing

917
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:43,935
These mass shootings

918
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:44,959
And makes them such a

919
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:45,983
Story

920
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:47,263
That means that copy

921
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,543
Seekatz are arising

922
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:49,567
Bright

923
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,455
In order to

924
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:57,247
To create these

925
00:49:57,503 --> 00:50:00,063
Which wood is s***

926
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,599
But it's also a

927
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:03,135
Fairly interesting

928
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:03,903
Argument

929
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:04,927
Is because yes

930
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:06,207
The media does

931
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:07,231
To benefit from

932
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,791
In the same way that gun manufacturers

933
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:10,815
And to benefit for

934
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:15,935
Is a philosophical cultural idea that was

935
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:19,775
Thoroughly explored in the Edward Burns movie 15 minutes

936
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:25,407
And we can move past this Tara I do I just don't I don't think there's much

937
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:26,687
Creep

938
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:27,967
To that argument is

939
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:28,735
Being like

940
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:29,759
Explanatory

941
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:35,647
There's someone on that in the chat room saying that we are very ignorant about guns

942
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:41,023
I copped to that

943
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:42,559
And that

944
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:45,887
I grew up in Central Missouri

945
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:48,191
I had a lot of friends who have guns

946
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:50,239
I know enough

947
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:51,263
About them

948
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:52,799
I-22

949
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:53,567
Have an opinion

950
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:57,663
Beyond that sure I don't know the finer points

951
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:01,247
5 gun laws in various States

952
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:02,271
I don't

953
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:04,319
And II

954
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,599
Whatever

955
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:07,391
I don't know if that's important

956
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,927
But

957
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:13,279
Don't necessarily think that a clear understanding of how guns work

958
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:15,071
And that kind of thing

959
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:16,095
Is necessary to

960
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:16,863
To saying that

961
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:17,631
Assault

962

Statistically

971

00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:16,511
The military

00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:24,703
I think Ivan can of worms

980
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:26,239
Getting that's as good as you can do

981
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:30,079
15 minutes

982
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:43,391
Great movie the FBI number

00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:19,999
Evax ideas

986
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:25,119
Google side effect dude

987
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:26,655
But that's just how it medicine

988
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:30,239
People's biology's are all different

989
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:31,263
People have different

990
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:32,031
Responses

991
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,567
To various

992
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:37,407
Just how it goes

993
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:39,967
I wonder I wonder what it would be like

994
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:40,991
Cheers

995
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:41,759

00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:43,295
Willing to just fly with

997
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:45,343
You know just like roll with the punches

998
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:46,111
Don't stick

999
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,135
Don't stick

1000
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:51,487
In one debate area where like

1001
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:53,279
It's coming at you with pills

1002
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:55,327
Merry crisis

1003
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:59,679
Is it a big deal to do you think that we should legalize drugs and then he be like

1004
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:00,959
And then the show with that

1005
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:02,495
Everything would be fine

1006
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:04,287
Everyone would go home Happy

1007
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:08,383
I'm not sure I'm not sure I agree with that assessment would go

1008
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:09,663
Absolutely

1009
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:19,135
Biscuit

1010
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:21,695
Let me ask you one question

1011
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:25,279
You'll believe it

1012
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:28,351
Jubilee restaurant is the under the second

1013
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:29,887
Your real concern

1014
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:31,935
Is the evil be overrun by

1015
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:34,239
Are they from

1016
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:36,287
Summerella

1017
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:40,383
The world

1018
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:42,943
57

1019
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:44,735
Maybe we should legalize drugs

1020
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:55,487
35 gum

1021
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:58,047
All Misfits

1022
00:54:58,815 --> 00:54:59,327
He

1023
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:03,679
Alex has told mentality that where there are like

1024
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:05,471
He's misattributed

1025
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:07,007
Correlation

1026
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:07,775
Causation

1027
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:10,079
With the idea that there are more guns

1028
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:13,151
Is now and the crime rates are going down

1029
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:15,455
He assumes they must be linked

1030
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:17,503
Right and that's just not the case

1031
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:23,903
Especially you see like there's a article I was reading the other day about how I New York

1032
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:24,671
His head like a

1033

Because there's

1038
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:32,351
Street thugs

1039
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:35,679
They all moved out it's like the opposite of

1040
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:38,495
The streets are Uggs all went over to

1041

1047
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:56,415
You have a very very big

1048
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:57,183
Platform

1049
00:55:57,439 --> 00:56:03,583
You are Thinkin 63 Networks

1050
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:07,935
There we go

1051
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:10,239
The stuff

1052
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:15,103
Talk about them pills Alex get that in there. Here's where we get to the dismount

1053
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:19,455
Interview

1054
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:22,271

1055
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:23,295
Kind of like

1056
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:25,343
Boy

1057
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,111
No

1058
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:32,767
Who do you believe was behind

1059
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:40,959
BBC reporter

1060
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:52,479
Who do you believe is behind

1061
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,391
The mass shooting

1062
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:06,559
Operation gladio

1063
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:07,839
What behind 911

1064
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:12,191
Even met 3 News reported

1065
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:16,543
That the hijackers will order to be allowed in the United States

1066
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:19,871
They have the Visa Department

1067
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:21,151
Was part of the conspiracy

1068
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:33,695
Martial law

1069
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:45,727
Conveyed

1070
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:49,567
50 firearms

1071
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:53,151
Many of them are increased in value 230 even four times

1072
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:55,199
I sleep very comfortably

1073
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:57,247
Outside Austin Texas

1074
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:05,183
Okay

1075
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:11,839
Whatever

1076
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:19,775
Commercial

1077
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:20,543
Whatever

1078
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:24,383
So I don't know what will you achieve

1079
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,151
Here

1080
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:25,919
But

1081
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:32,319
It's it's interesting to me because there is there is a little bit of that Alex Jones being

1082
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:33,855
Complete a****** in a

1083
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:36,671
Sort of funny way the British accent

1084
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:41,535
You didn't like that there was a horn on that a mile away

1085
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:42,559
That's again

1086
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:44,351
My problems are my fault

1087
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:46,399
Because I already made

1088
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:47,679
Comparison to him

1089
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:51,519
Watching one of those clips on his own show

1090
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:52,543
Always

1091
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:55,103
Always does the mocking axe

1092
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:02,527
I don't know it's interesting that the other way Alex presents

1093
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:04,319
In his own

1094
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:05,343
Apologizing

1095
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:06,111
His past is

1096
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:08,671
Is that you know he goes in there and he slayed the

1097
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:09,439
The Beast

1098
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:13,023
That is Piers Morgan and destroyed his ratings

1099
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:15,839
To be the globalist

1100
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:17,631
Jill that he is right

1101
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,679
And a Morgan wanted to fight him

1102
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:21,983
Couldn't handle Alex Jones is brilliant

1103
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:28,383
Being a what about Aesthetics hold upon related

1104
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:30,175
Information in order to

1105
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:34,271
Dodge points

1106
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:35,039
Piers Morgan

1107
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:38,623
So the reality does not really match up with his mythology

1108
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:40,927
It's fun anyway

1109
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:48,863
Springs

1110
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:52,447
Here here 2017

1111
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:55,263
Everybody for coming along with us

1112
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:57,311
Interesting

1113
00:59:58,335 --> 00:59:59,103
I agree

1114
00:59:59,359 --> 00:59:59,871
I would say so

1115
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:02,175
2018

1116
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:02,943
Christine

1117
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:08,063
But if you want to check

1118
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:09,855
About what

1119
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:10,879
Give me one

1120
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:11,903
Give me one prediction

1121
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:15,231
What to do in Media

1122
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:17,535
Type thing at the end of the year you're supposed to be

1123
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:18,559
Be like well we've learned

1124
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:22,143
Coin

1125
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:23,679
Will be the preferred current

1126
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:30,335
In America Max Keiser master

1127
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:32,383
That would be an inch

1128
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:38,783
Why not

1129
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:39,807
Hedge your bets

1130
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:42,623
Imagine if you'd been on the ground floor B

1131
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:44,927
Write a billionaire

1132
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:46,719
Next week

1133
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:51,327
The stock market

1134
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:53,375
Quita Quita roller coaster

1135
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:54,911
I don't know

1136
01:00:57,215 --> 01:01:01,055
Everything is awesome everything is weird

1137
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:03,359
That's my prediction

1138
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:04,383
Let's

1139
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:06,687
Let's go let's go odds

1140
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:09,759
What do you

1141
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:10,527
Think the midterm

1142
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:14,367
The sense that I get I think

1143
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:15,903
A lot of the polling

1144
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:17,439
Wildly

1145
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,207
Competitive

1146
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:18,975
I think Democrat

1147
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:19,743
That's probably take

1148
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:21,279
You think so

1149
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:22,559
I think at least enough

1150
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:24,863
Maybe I don't know

1151
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:27,679
That's where a lot of the things I'm saying

1152
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:28,959
But at the same time

1153
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:30,239
I don't f****** know

1154
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:31,775
Possible for the Democrats

1155
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:34,335
To get a supermajority a two-thirds vote in the Sun

1156
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:36,127
I'm not entirely sure on that

1157
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:39,199
But I don't know where I can we can't make any predictions

1158
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:41,503
Noah

1159
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:43,551
Far enough away Villa

1160
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:48,159
I don't know what kind of smear campaign people like

1161
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:50,207
Crnkovich are going to try and

1162
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:52,255
Float it's a movie Anything Could Happen

1163
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:53,535
I didn't think it would be

1164
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:55,071
Be close with Roy Moore

1165
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:55,839
It was fun

1166
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:56,863
Closest ship

1167
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:01,471
No idea my suspicions

1168
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:04,543
Prediction

1169
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:07,359
Straight white dudes

1170
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:08,639
Still going to be off

1171
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:12,479
I think that's probably mean if history is Prelude

1172
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:15,039
It looks like that is a good prediction

1173
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:17,343
Statistics of the Roy Moore vote

1174
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:19,903
Especially when you when you factor in straight white

1175
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:22,719
70% of straight

1176
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:23,743
Something like that

1177
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:24,767
Voted for

1178
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:25,791
Or not

1179
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:26,815
Just wait

1180
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:27,839
Other weekend

1181
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:28,863
If you're a Republican

1182
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:32,191
Supermajority

1183
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:32,959
It is not possible

1184
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:35,775
That would have been nice

1185
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:39,615
To be able to override veto only prediction

1186
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:41,407
My only prediction is

1187
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:47,039
White people are not going to learn but I got to be like

1188
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:49,087
White people are still going to vote

1189
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:52,159
Is going to

1190
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:53,439
Maine

1191
01:02:57,535 --> 01:02:58,815
We need to commit white gem

1192
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:05,215
If you

1193
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:06,751
Killer whale

1194
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:08,543
Will rise again

1195
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:10,847
Another prediction is Nolan

1196
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:21,599
What's up people will start going to our website

1197
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:25,439

1198
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:27,487

1200
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:34,399
Knowledge underscore fight

1201
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:37,983
We are

1202
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:41,567
Vagina

1203
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:43,615
Exploring couple other

1204
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:44,383
Podcast

1205
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:46,175
Tribute

1206
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:48,735
I've gotten a couple emails from people who have like

1207
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:49,503
Androids

1208
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:54,367
I don't know man

1209
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:55,135
Podcast app

1210
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:03,071
Interested

1211
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:04,351
Ungrateful

1212
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:07,679
Infowars

1213
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:09,727
On the Alex Jones Show on December

1214
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:11,263
January 7th

1215
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:12,287
20

1216
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:13,567
The day

1217
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:14,591
That Alex

1218
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:16,895
New York for the

1219
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:18,431
To tape what we do

1220
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:19,199
Just listen to

1221
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:20,991
Guess what

1222
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:22,527
John rapper

1223
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:26,111
Support was co-hosting with a fill-in hopes

1224
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:27,391
Yeah Alex

1225
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:28,927
Alex had a fill-in host

1226
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:29,951
Who is that

1227
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:32,767
Little crazy

1228
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:35,327
Jon rappoport

1229
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:36,607
Songs beard

1230
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:37,887
In 2013

1231
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:39,679
What's it was upsetting

1232
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:40,959
It didn't take

1233
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:47,103
A long time for him to grow the weird beard that he has right now might be 3 years running a boy

1234
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:49,407
That's a very quick turnaround for

1235
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:50,687
The other thing

1236
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:51,967
I checked it out

1237
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:56,575
Thursday John Rappaport was in fourth hours during 4th hour

1238
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:57,343
Get this

1239
01:04:57,855 --> 01:04:58,367
Picture was hung

1240
01:04:58,879 --> 01:04:59,391
No

1241
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:02,207
However

1242
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:03,231
He was not

1243
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:04,255
Talking about

1244
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:05,023
HIV

1245
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:07,583
He was not talking about the facts

1246
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:09,631
Are you talkin about

1247
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:11,935
Tom DeLonge

1248
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:18,591
UFOs are false

1249
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:19,359
Swag

1250
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:24,223
Oh that's right I forgot about you they're real

1251
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:30,623
Apparently this is nonsense in order to make people scared of space busy

1252
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:39,071
And there's one thing that I was thrilled to

1253
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:40,351
But then also

1254
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:42,911
I got to hear John Rappaport say

1255
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:45,983
Jim semivan

1256
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:51,103
Made me pretty happy

1257
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:53,919
And it's still weird to have this like

1258
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:57,247
You know there are spiritual

1259
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:58,015
Connections

1260
01:05:58,271 --> 01:06:00,319
Between Project Camelot

1261
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:03,903
Clean-shaven like no beard at offsetting

1262
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:05,951
Not upsetting to look at

1263
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:08,255
Weird

1264
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:09,279
Very much so

1265
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:12,863
Just to look at him say

1266
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:13,887
John Rappaport

1267
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:15,423
Go fuc yourself

1268
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:16,447
Happy New Year

1269
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:19,775
Holding

1270
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:25,407
Alexandra Thurston color with your trip and I love your work
