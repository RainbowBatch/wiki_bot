1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alex

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:16,640
Novelty Beverages and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

3
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:23,808
To one of our

4
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:31,744
Useless Democratic senator the one you're on the warpath today

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,816
Murderously terrible

6
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:36,352
Possible f****** way

7
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:40,192
How would you explain the show to these incompetent

8
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:43,008
Veronica monsters that we have elected to lead

9
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:49,408
Well first I would say a podcast is like a radio show

10
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:55,808
The first step that describe describe

11
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:03,232
F*** you. f*** you right off the bat

12
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:09,632
It was

13
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,936
That's Show Business

14
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:18,336
I would say that I know a lot about Alex Jones

15
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:20,640
At your stupid f****** idiots

16
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:25,760
Spell politician sexual

17
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,296

21
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:36,768
Soyuz

22
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,608
Today

23
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:45,216
Sure where we are going is

24
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,240
Great Dane

25
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:49,824
The present

26
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,592
BoRics

27
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:54,944
So for those people who have been following our escapades

28
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,016
Recent

29
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,392
The past

30
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:10,816
We're going to 2000

31
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,096
Before

32
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:15,680
Rarely sort of

33
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,216
Because

34
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:21,056
The episode I was listening in 2008

35
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:21,824
Not great

36
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,176
And they're on unusable but I realized

37
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,968
June might not be the best place to

38
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:34,368
Start buddy told me it reminded me that

00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,696

I'm and we're going to

44
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:53,824
To be deal with it as we go through this episode

45
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,616
Episode of January 7th

46
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,384
Through 9th

47
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,408
2009

48
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,272
You're going to be going on a very interesting roller coaster today

49
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,320
Discovered

00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,648
2009 Alex

51
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,464
That you are ready for

52
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,048
But there are some familiar pieces and you have contacts dropped

53
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,072
That sort of familiar

54
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,936
Alright

55
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,728
Unforgotten

56
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:22,752
The business to do

57
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:29,152
The flavor of via the things to comment then

58
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:32,992
No I would like a glass

59
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:39,392
After that he starts laughing as I suggested food

60
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,536
Guilty of the sexual assault lawsuit

61
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,096
The area well harassment

62
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,496
If we give some shout out

00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:59,872
Donors I want to say just big picture we recently crossed the hundred donor mark

64
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:03,456
No s*** hundred plus policy walks out there

65
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,736
Crazy is nuts

66
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:07,296
When we started the show

67
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,064
Ham

68
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,600
I didn't think they would be

69
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,880
Quite frankly

70
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:17,024
And now we're at a point where were over 100 people are we lost

71
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:28,543
Comedian Tommy McNamara's mom donated to myself

72
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,567
Dammit

73
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,967
It's just so great

74
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,247
The show is going

75
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,271
To be able to allow me

76
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,551

Every time we play these drops

88
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,199

Very very fun

121
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,703
Technocrat

122
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:44,127
Don't get mine until your brilliant someone sodomite sent me a bucket

123
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,647

Your significant other were absolutely fantastic

128
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,167
Absolutely

129
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:10,751
Navigate to meet folks

130
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:13,055
It's a treat for us

131
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,591
I believe that spirits

132
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:22,271
It'll be most of the thrill I think

133
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,319
Secondaries

134
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:30,463
Well there's a part of me that's like

135
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:38,399
Real I kind of assumed this is more of an elaborate scam that you are perpetrating on me

136
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,847
Something that you're just trying to make my last days

137
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:47,871
Is exciting as

138
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,919
All your likes look

139
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:55,039
What is f l o r

140
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,319
I don't understand

141
00:08:56,575 --> 00:09:00,671
I've got to be a dichotomy

142
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:05,279
It's great I'm emotionally overwhelmed and the only thing you can do in situations like that

143
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,559
Just keep on moving forward

144
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:07,839
So weird

145
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,703
Get to it alright

146
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,775

147
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,567
2000 dime

148
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,615
And let me say something to you

149
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,943
This works clip is going to blow your goddamn mind

150
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:23,967
Alright

151
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,527
This is what Alex starts out the show talking about

152
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:29,599
Have you spend most of the show talking about this

153
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,391
You would never

154
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,951
Expect these kinds of things come out of Alex doing just now

155
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,231
In 2018

156
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:36,511
15

157
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,303
Anywhere that we've looked into

158
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,655
Oh no

159
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:48,287
Portugal

160
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,527
They took the black man off the train

161
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,487
And that they then we're putting them in handcuffs

162
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:11,839
The man was resisting

163
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,663
There was a altercation

164
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,967
Argument

165
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,551
The officers

166
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:36,415
Now he's talking about

167
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,743
Argument on the train between

168
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,327
They had the police respond

169
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,143
Psychological

170
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,471
There's

171
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,591
What the f***

172
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,127
It should

173
00:10:56,383 --> 00:11:00,479
Alex Jones

174
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:03,039
Coming out against the shooting of life

175
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,063
Absolutely

176
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:10,463
Conversation

177
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:13,279
Like we should all be like murdering black people

178
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,583
Specifically

179
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,447
Do Alexandra like everything probably

180
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:22,239
Then that he's against it

181
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,519
Where did this

182
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:31,455
I almost fainted

183
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,551
Should be every dictator

184
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,831
Who decides which

185
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:42,463
Statute or Lord

186
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:47,583
Oscar Grant

187
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:52,447
Is out party because it was on New Year's Eve

188
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:56,287
2 a.m. on New Year's Day 2009

189
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,895
BART train

190
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,687
Francisco

191
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:10,623
Terms of the specifics of it but who cares the long and short of it I did cops try to arrest

192
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,647
Arrest this guy

193
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:14,975
Had him down on the ground with back

194
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:20,095
As I understand it looked

195
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,143
I've looked into this and from what I understand

196
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,447
They're trying to handcuff him but he was

197
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:31,103
Like they couldn't get his hands right so you wasn't to me

198
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,039
Station and there was bit of there was some

199
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,719
End up getting

200
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:50,815
He at least resigned

201
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,375
We got to have the details.

202
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,703
Somehow that was a better time

203
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,007
What do you mean

204
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,567
I mean at least he received at least he had some sort of

205
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:02,847
Forward I guess

206
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,383
I don't know

207
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,663
That's all

208
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,271
Was it today or yes

209
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,575
Today that Alabama put up a monument

210
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:13,855
Victims of Lynch

211
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,695
It's a good thing that that's over

212
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:20,767
Good thing we don't have to worry about

213
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,559
State-sponsored murder

214
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,423
A jury found the cop

215
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,519
Are Johannes marasli guilty of involuntary manslaughter

216
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,311
They're not guilty of charges

217
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,591
The second-degree murder of all

218
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,895
That's not great

219
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,991
Could have added

220
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:41,759
And yours too

221
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,063
Wait a minute legible for probation

222
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,599
85%

223
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,903
Great

224
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,463
Vitality

225
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,231
Is she at

226
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:56,607
That's not great but the end results receive Snowman

227
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,375
BrickTop's

228
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,655
At least

229
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,567
Alex's

230
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,591
Against the cops

231
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,639
And in favor of

232
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,431
Murder victim

233
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:13,247
Oscar Grant his name

234
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,039
It's kind of weird

235
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,063
Well

236
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:19,391
Humanizes in Witcher

237
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,415
To do

238
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,439
Is

239
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,255
The case was thrown out

240
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,791
I don't know if that's

241
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:32,191
Operating awnings it might be the case

242
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:36,287
Braiding on incomplete information about the the end turn out of this

243
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,311
So I don't know

244
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:40,895
What's up Jordan now

245
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:43,455
Still further

246
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,527
Kind of clearly assessing the situation

247
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:51,135
How much more real way I read the

248
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,671
Message in the chat room Rock nevermind

249
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:59,327
Sorry

250
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,607
That just change

251
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:03,935
My disappointment and sadness levels from from

252
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,727
About yay high

253
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:06,751
To evaluate

254
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,799
I'm going to stop responding

255
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:09,823
To iMessages I do

256
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,127
Don't fully understand

257
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:15,199
Alex is against it

258
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,991
The shooting is

259
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:21,343
Good boys

260
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:27,743
No that is a big issue

261
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:32,095
Excuses

262
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,399
It was

263
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,679
May have been

264
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,799
The police officials

265
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,871
Transit Authority

266
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,503
So first of all

267
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,551
That is

268
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:54,367
The point is good

269
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,207
I told you

270
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,487
Even understand

271
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,279
I don't understand how that

272
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,327
What what

273
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:09,727
I believe

274
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:12,287
You lied about it

275
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,079
Weird

276
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:20,223
I think is fairly philosophically consistent with what Alex pretends to be

277
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,503
You know what I mean

278
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,783
Like he's giving

279
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,551
Credit

280
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:26,367
Hurry leeway to some extent but still being like

281
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,927
Need to go to prison you lied about shooting a guy

282
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:29,951
Yeah

283
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:35,071
The issue there is that it almost seems like more his response

284
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,607
Had they just been like

285
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,679
That guy he would have been like

286
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:46,591
No I don't think so

287
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:50,943
No because

288
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,783
If they took responsibility for it then he would be mad if they didn't get

289
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,551
The

290
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,087
Direct consequences

291
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,367
David Mann

292
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,415
I think

293
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:06,815
Won't that all this is really to illustrate an eclipse not done

294
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:09,631
2009 is not like cop

295
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,191
But slightly Pro murder

296
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,311
Police officer

297
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,879
Dropped his hand with a gun starts cussing

298
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,183
What the hell what the hell

299
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,911
Because I hate cops

300
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:50,079
That could be we don't know

301
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,919
Every shot

302
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:58,015
Books

303
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:01,087
Doesn't matter you still

304
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,279
You killed somebody

305
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,303
This is crazy

306
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,351
This is crazy from my

307
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,375
Such a departure

308
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:14,911
This is not

309
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,543
We've been doing this show

310
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,823
For a long time

311
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,103
Almost a year-and-a-half now

312
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:24,895
Bat

313
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,431
Crazy

314
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,711
Very much so

315
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,015
That's the first time I've

316
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:33,343
Genuinely

317
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:37,439
Because there's no part of it where he's trying to blame to the globalist

318
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:43,839
There's no part of it where you saying he's fake it's fake or anything like that

319
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,119
Anything wild

320
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,423
He's even leaving it over

321
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,959
We don't know the facts

322
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,727
For sure

323
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,543
Is that this man was killed

324
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,383
You got to go to work

325
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,943
There's no there's no

326
00:18:59,199 --> 00:18:59,967
I know he

327
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:00,735
Murdered

328
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,783
There's no

329
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,087
Globalist

330
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,111
Trick has ended

331
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,671
Actually murder

332
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,951
Bright

333
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:10,975
It just him

334
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,255
With a measured

335
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:18,655
No it is like maybe giving too far of a birth

336
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:22,495
To be like

337
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:25,823
But he this is where he's operating from

338
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,871
What I would describe as

339
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:34,527
Acceptable realm of conversation conversation

340
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:45,279
They lie more often they tell the truth

341
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,839
And bananas

342
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:51,935
Culture of lying and deceit

343
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,703
What

344
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,871
Hyperventilating

345
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:02,175
Cops are liars

346
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:06,015
It's a culture of lying right

347
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:06,783
What

348
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,879
Wild now

349
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,927
I am starting to believe in the global

350
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,975
Because now

351
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:15,743
It is very

352
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,559
That some shadowy organization

353
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,607
Murdered Alex Jones

354
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,631
Who at this time

355
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,655
Perhaps was

356
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:28,799
Okay and then replaced him with the monster that we see mouth as controlled opposition

357
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:34,687
It's to make sure that he used his insanity is it is ignore it's an interesting possibility

358
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,967
I'd say

359
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:38,015
Occam's razor

360
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,391
He just started taking

361
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:49,791
Supplemented my crazy maybe not I don't know it's very difficult for me to figure out like his business

362
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,327
Huge curveball

363
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:56,191
Yeah that's why is this evolve into the guy we know now

364
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:59,007
Like this and I just agree with

365
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:02,847
Agree with dentist even exist

366
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:03,615
Kaepernick

367
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,431
4 months

368
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:12,831
People on the field in protest of a thing that Alex in 2009 is super

369
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:16,416
Where is the problem

370
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,720
Forgiato

371
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,256
This bananas

372
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:26,400
You if you wanted a ton president if you want to become even more sympathetic to him

373
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:35,104
Alright this is all it is in the music of Lady intro music

374
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:41,504
Clayton Vinson packages Adams

375
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:38,336
Are those lyrics

376
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:41,408
Castroville

377
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:48,064
Holy s*** it's like unbelievable

378
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:48,832
Accidentally

379
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:51,136
You f****** loves good country

380
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,696
This allows The Highwayman

381
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:54,464
I don't know

382
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,816
I'm confused

383
00:22:59,072 --> 00:22:59,840
Professional level

384
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:04,192
Singing along to work

385
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:08,800
Have a great time.

386
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,128
To do

387
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,920
Yeah

388
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,968
I feel like we started all over again

389
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:21,344
I have to rewire all of my hatred for Alex Jones

390
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,392
Knowing full well that in the past

391
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,672
He was less of a

392
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,792
Bedtime.

393
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,816
But

394
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:36,192
Is banana a lot of stuff that

395
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:36,960
That like

396
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,984
You can trace

397
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:39,520
Like

398
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,800
Literal

399
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:41,568
Parallel

400
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,848
From back then to now

401
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:45,920
Catch phrases that use using 11

402
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,456
I'd like 9 years ago and

403
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,736
I'm still using now like

404
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:53,344
Coming up in the mainstream media's ratings are down

405
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,952
He has like a philosophy of like if someone's being attacked that probably means they're right

406
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:01,024
Which is consistent all throughout this timeframe

407
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:05,376
There's a lot of visit lot of things that are really common but yet

408
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,656
I think with your mortgage

409
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:07,680
To wrestle with

410
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,448
He's like

411
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,728
You know the future

412
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,568
This is great look at this guy without knowing

413
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:18,432
I know you've read the stories are all over again

414
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:23,040
Whatever I want

415
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,344
January 7th

416
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,648
Weekend of January 8th

417
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,184
Nothing else

418
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:33,536
Not right now I mean what else

419
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:38,400
Show up on that little spot and that's all you have from January 7th

420
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:41,984
More about

421
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,032
Boring I just want like some kind of

422
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,056
How did this

423
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:49,920
Mystery all over again.

424
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:52,992
Alright

425
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:57,344
Texas Corridor that road that they're really matter

426
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,160
Stop

427
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,952
Not very nice

428
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:08,352
He has an interview with a guy named Eric Plumlee no relation to toss Plumlee

429
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:14,752
Mason Plumlee interview about like the government surveillance

430
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:22,176
Is it well no but Eric Plumlee is a surveillance lawyer but it turns out his specialty is like

431
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:28,576
You trying to bug your wifey

432
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:33,440
It doesn't go really far cuz everytime I try to talk about bigger-picture stuff

433
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,720
Are Plum is kind of like

434
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,256
That's outside my purview

435
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:41,888
Gotcha with Ray McGovern used to be involved in like a daily briefings for Reagan incest

436
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:47,008
It's not that it's not really all that substantial like

437
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:54,688
Kind of endgame stuff

438
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,992
I have never met before in my entire life

439
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:59,552
Is a lot of stuff and then

440
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,624
Very weird position on this shooting

441
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,464
Google Map

442
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,280
Give me my thoughts

443
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:15,936
You get right back into that road good half-hour at Lady of the show

444
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,264
Did you have fun

445
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:25,664
There's less empathy for the victim than you want it for a more anger at the cops

446
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,688
But at least

447
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:33,088
I'm happier with that it's a road in at least not like anything we

448
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,112
We've ever seen from Alex

449
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:37,696
And it gets even weirder an alternate universe right now

450
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:40,768
January 8th gets even weirder

451
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:47,680
Now I see more of this officer's body language looks like he's completely

452
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,776
He's resigning from the force

453
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,272
What does that mean

454
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,904
Capital murder

455
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,256
Manslaughter

456
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,304
Weather

457
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,496
I'm getting off on a

458
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,568
Because you watched you know

459
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,592
He cites

460
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:33,504
Black

461
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,632
Holds the shot for about 2 seconds and shoots the guy in the back

462
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:54,752
Closer video angle

463
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,544
I'm somebody cell phone camera

464
00:27:57,312 --> 00:28:01,920
He looks like

465
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:04,992
His eyes are completely

466
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:15,744
You know what you remind me of the

467
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:22,400
He's not a human he's a literal demon bright again it's a little it's a little cowardly in terms

468
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:28,032
This is like not allow humans to take responsibility for their actions

469
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:30,592
The point is right that he watched another video

470
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:33,152
You can see him citing it

471
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:36,992
Point behind what he's trying to say

472
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:39,808
Ban

473
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,344
I don't

474
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,160
That's crazy

475
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:44,928
30 knots

476
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,536
Did the idea of Alex Jones revising his theories based on new information

477
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:52,864
Is that okay

478
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,448
Fat is super nuts

479
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:59,008
Well he got

480
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,544
Crazier with it

481
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:06,176
Become more

482
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:10,016
Concrete only

483
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:11,040
Got

484
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:13,600
And his beliefs changed

485
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:15,136
I can't process this in

486
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:17,440
Information

487
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:20,000
The only Alex I no understand

488
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:20,768
Is the Alex

489
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:21,792
To Double Down

490
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:22,816
Alex

491
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,608
Who waffles like a little bit

492
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:29,472
Shrek as the only

493
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,752
Yell cries

494
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,288
Drugs shirts

495
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,336
I'm so

496
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:40,736
This position that he's taking on the shooting is really wild obviously they're a bunch of

497
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,576
We're rightly mad about the

498
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,344
The situation

499
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,904
Now we get back to

500
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:59,168
Protests over Bart shooting turned violent San Francisco Chronicle I watched video of it

501
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:06,848
Permitted crowd

502
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,640
Play begin throwing

503
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:16,320
Police cars

504
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:19,904
The police began firing rubber bullets at the crowd

505
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:31,680
Excuses

506
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:35,776
You have to punish your officers when they murder people

507
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:41,152
What the f***

508
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:47,296
You thought the entire time he was ramping up to talk s*** about the protesters

509
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,064
He was

510
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,368
He was defending that we're justifying it

511
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,440
It's pretty nuts

512
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:05,728
Dan inosanto I had a whole bunch of anger in the in the holster for today and now it is

513
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,080
You're shocking

514
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:14,688
Before the show that I had something

515
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:17,760
I know I don't even I don't even

516
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:20,064
What is the show if I think

517
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,112
He's he's advocating

518
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:28,000
For violent but he's Justified a violent response

519
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,536
Stacked

520
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:34,144
That is again unlawful in itself

521
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,424
V

522
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,216
He's a very least like

523
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:39,520
Coherently explaining why

524
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:45,920
Let him know if my people

525
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:49,504
Rioting is the voice of the unheard

526
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,552
I don't know

527
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,088
Just

528
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,112
Credibly Bazaar

529
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,232
It's weird I'm confused

530
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,304
Neither

531
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:03,584
So

532
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,144
Time-travel is there

533
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,424
Is there like a

534
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:10,496
Like if we're if we're going to indulge

535
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,288
Which I think is probably

536
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,336
If we get into a timer

537
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,920
Is there anyway that we can talk to the Alex Jones

538
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:18,944
From the time

539
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,480
And then put him on a

540
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,248
Completely

541
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,808
Like like just just butterfly

542
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:26,880
We don't we don't

543
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:33,280
Just throw a Little Rock and then all the sudden grows into an activist like what's going on

544
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,840
Possible

545
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:36,864
But

546
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:40,192
Again I'm not eat his brains

547
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,216
Take a strength

548
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:43,776
I'm not doing this intentionally

549
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:45,568
To butter you up I'm playing you the

550
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,848
The clips that are relevant

551
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,384
In the order they come

552
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,408
This

553
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,432
Next clip

554
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:52,224
Made me smile

555
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:52,992
What are you doing

556
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:54,528
This next flip

557
00:32:54,784 --> 00:33:00,928
This is one of the only you are f****** with my head about whenever he listens to Highwayman it's kind of

558
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,976
That's a happy Alex

559
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:05,280
You can hear a couple moments in this next

560
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:07,072
Clip where it's like this is

561
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,096
Thirdly happy hour

562
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,056
I was very clean

563
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:23,712
I like

564
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:25,504
Mother

565
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,528
That was it

566
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,744
We know you're a drug dealer

567
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:44,192
Don't forget the cops

568
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:52,896
Golf carts

569
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:01,600
Golf courses

570
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:05,952
Motorcycle

571
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,512
Sometimes

572
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:23,616
Golf

573
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,200
Astoria

Roll around in the leaves

577
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:52,288
That's about the extent of what are you working

578
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,104
That's human they're rolling around

We decided we frame for a murder because it surely would have on our lives

589
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:01,152
I mean you talk about eminent domain

590
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:06,272
2 minutes or so of him getting wistful

591
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,296
Compelling

You scamper off and you smoke them

595
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,048
Like that's

596
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:20,864
So relatable in human and

597
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,144
Cute

598
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,936
Italy

00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:30,592
In this world it could be in the movie

00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:33,408
American Graffiti

601
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:35,456
But did you notice there at the end

602
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:36,480
Like

603
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:39,552
He keeps losing the point of why

604
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:45,952
He's telling these stories and he forgets to talk about

605
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:52,608
Like teachers trying to turn into a snitch or something like that

606
00:36:55,168 --> 00:37:01,312
433 at this 45

607
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,848

608
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:06,944

609
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:12,064
I mean I'm fascinated by the losing yourself incense

610
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,344
Telling me stories

611
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,392
I meant needing to get back on track

612
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,184
View jumps back onto

613
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,976
The cops think we're all guilty

614
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:22,048
You know like that's where he's mine gets back on

615
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:22,816
To the narrative

616
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:23,840
And it's just

617
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:24,608
To me it's like

618
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:30,496
Vista brain work better

619
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:35,104
Alex Jones Show Now into a weird behind the music for me

Just going to make him happy

636
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:10,944

You're going to learn more about 2

643
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,256
2009 it's worth

644
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,816
That's why we went back to

645
00:38:59,072 --> 00:38:59,584
To this date

646
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,352
Specifically to

647
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,656
Relaunch r2000

648
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:04,192
From this point forward

649
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:06,752
Is that is because on January 7th

650
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:08,032
2009

651
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:10,592
I will read to you from

652
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,408
The guardian article from that very day

653
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:20,064
Gazprom the state-owned Russian gas group today cut off all supplies to Europe traveling through the Ukrainian pipeline

654
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:23,904
Intensifying the political and economic crisis that has arisen out of

655
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,440
Payment payment dispute

656
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,464
Between the two country

657
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:31,072
Amid evidence that people in Eastern Europe are being deprived of heating as the Arctic

658
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,096
Cold Max

659
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:32,864
Continues

660
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,888
Russia and Ukraine cat

661
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:35,680
Continue to blame each other for the deadlock

662
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:37,216
Guess prom accuses

663
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:40,288
Ukraine or shutting down the fourth and last open pipeline

664
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:44,128
The country while efficient

665
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:46,688
Ukraine State energy firm SimpliSafe

666
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,968
Words fail

667
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:52,064
Russia supplies a quarter of Europe's gas and 80% of this Transit

668
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:52,832
It's through Ukraine

669
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:55,136
Has shortages hit Western Europe and intense

670
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:58,720
EU governments will meet on Friday to

671
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:00,512
Consider sharing supplies held in storage

672
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,048
So

673
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,096
After this clip

674
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:04,864
But

675
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,144
Suffice it to say

676
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:09,472
At this point because of some

677
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,496
Contractual

678
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,312
On January 7th

679
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:14,592
Russia cut off

680
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:15,616
Oil Vape

681
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,408
That was

682
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:18,688
Most

683
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:20,224
Of the supplies

684
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,248
418 conch

685
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,528
That all

686
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:25,088
Because of disagreements with

687
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,624
They're they're fine a

688
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:29,696
In terms of any argument

689
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:31,232
Public like this

690
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:33,792
Entertain in like a large-scale

691
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,840
I am immediately going to

692
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:36,608
To side with the

693
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:38,144
The person who has the least

694
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,984
Wordy response like

695
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,800
Ukraine's responses like

696
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,336
Dude I don't

697
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,360
Even know what that guy

698
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,384
I talkin about

699
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,968
I'm I'm immediately like yeah Ukraine's right

700
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:55,040
Words fail us is a strong response

701
00:40:55,552 --> 00:41:00,160
You can't believe this guy

702
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:02,976
Escalating

703
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,000
A few days prior

704
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:07,584
Does Russia

705
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,864
Cut off most

706
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:09,888
Supply

707
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:11,936
And then on the 7th cut off all of it

708
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:14,240
What were they doing on the

709
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:15,520
Hanging out

710
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:17,824
Just put on the on the 7th

711
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,848
Didn't even bring it up

712
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,408
He says this

713
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,456
And now

714
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,832
Ukraine threatening to

715
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,488
Russia cut back on some of the

716
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:42,656
They just cut off

717
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:43,936
People could do either

718
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:07,743
That's a quick turnaround illustrate how quickly

719
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:11,839
Talk about it ever again

720
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:21,823
You're not allowed anymore.

721
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:25,919
Bring it back up and that's crazy

722
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:30,271
Ukraine is a Megan

723
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:37,439
Crane shutting it off

724
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:39,231
Call

725
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:40,511
Now we're back in Comfort

726
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:45,375
Triple territory Alex Alex Jordan with Russia on a literally anything

727
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:48,703
Is where I am where I am comfortable

728
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:50,239
Very very strange

729
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:54,079
Because it's so it's so dismissive

730
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,359
It's so

731
00:42:56,383 --> 00:43:01,247
Like yours a 10-second blurb about this and then we're moving out to pay you can't resell crib

732
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:07,135
A report from the ox

733
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:08,671
Shepherd Institute of energy

734
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:10,463
Studies about the

735
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:13,279
The crisis because I wanted to get a good handle on what the

736
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:16,351
The situation was it was reasonable anyway

737
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,375
For Alex

738
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:20,959
That Ukraine was behind the actual shutting off

739
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:23,775
Killing Europe

740
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:26,079
Right

741
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,455
It's from Mystic Sea page report

742
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:33,503
That the Oxford energy

To put out

744
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,063
Dictionary by the way

745
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:39,391
Early hours

746
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:41,695
6th of January possibly the key moments

747
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:43,743
The crisis is far as deliveries to Europe work

748
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:44,511
Concerned

749
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:49,631
On the 5th televised rather obviously staged conversation between prime minister Putin

750
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:51,935
And gazprom CEO Miller rehearse

751
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:52,703
All the Russian

752
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:53,471
Grievances

753
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:54,495
Against Ukraine

754
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:57,055
Greenwood Miller's proposal

755
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:58,591
To reduce the gas flow

756
00:43:58,847 --> 00:43:59,359
And instruct

757
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:01,919
Open him to inform gazprom's European partners

758
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:03,199
About the reasons for the ACT

759
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:04,735
At this point

760
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:06,271
On the 7th of January

761
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:08,063
The second more serious stage of

762
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:10,111
Gas was cut off

763
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:12,927
Completely two countries in Southeastern Europe where

764
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:15,743
Which are 100%

765
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,791
Imports to other countries

766
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:18,559
413

767
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:22,655
The Russian and Ukrainian size blamed each other neither

768
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:23,935
See about moving towards a green

769
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:27,775
It is important to underline the unprecedented nature of the situation

770
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:29,823
Supplies to Europe it never been halted

771
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:30,591
Spencer gastrin

772
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:31,615
The system was built in

773
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:32,383
Soviet time

774
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:36,479
The two sides finally negotiated two new contracts covering

775
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:37,503
Supply in transit

776
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,551
Which were signed on the 19th of January

777
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:41,855
Gas was to Europe restarted in the morning of

778
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:42,623
The 20th

779
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:44,671
And two days later returning to normal

780
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,207
So that's her

781
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:46,975
Description

782
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:47,999
Of what

783
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,791
Get to their conclusion

784
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:53,375
Russia Ukraine bilateral gastrulation

785
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:54,655
Does not in itself

786
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:55,423
Surprise

787
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:57,471
Many including ourselves of Tina coming

788
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:59,519
As long ago as December of 2000

789
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:03,871
The surprise indeed the shock was that both sides allowed to escalate

790
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:05,151
Disagreements about debts

791
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:06,687
Prices on Transit tariff

792
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:08,479
To the point where supplies to Europe work

793
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:09,503
We shut off

794
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:10,527
Allowed

795
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:13,087
The situation to continue for two weeks in the middle of winter

796
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,391
Mysterious adverse humanitarian cops

797
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:17,951
Before especially Southeast European

798
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:25,119
We do not believe the often cited desire of the Russian government to use energy as an economic or political weapon

799
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,399
Against European country

800
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:28,191
Played any part in this crisis

801
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:30,495
Russia's relationship with Europe

802
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:33,567
Pendergast beer is and will remain one of mutual dependence

803
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,639
Well you're heavily on Russian gas supplies

804
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:39,455
Russia which here means both gazprom and the Russian

805
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:41,247
Realized

806
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:44,319
Relies heavily on revenues generated from Europe

807
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:46,111
By contrast

808
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,391
The critical Russian

809
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:50,207
Decision to cut back deliveries on the 5th of January

810
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:51,487
Russia did it

811
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:56,351
Wasn't unnecessarily risky and commercially a rational action

812
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:57,375
At this stage of the

813
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:58,143
Dispute

814
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:59,679
That decision may have reflected

815
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:00,703
Did prime minister Putin

816
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:01,983
Anger and frustration

817
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:04,287
I've been aimed at punishing Ukrainian for its

818
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,311
Repeated threats to

819
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,079
Disrupt Transit

820
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,639
40 Years of Russia's reputation

821
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:09,919
Secure gas supplier

822
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:11,199
And Ukraine's reputation

823
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:12,223
Secure Transit

824
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:13,503
Country have been damaged

825
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:19,135
The Russian government almost certainly personalized prime minister Putin

826
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:22,975
Which took the decisions which eventually lead on the 7th of January

827
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:24,255
To the complete interruption

828
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,535
European supplies

829
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:27,839
3D right Ukrainian Transit Network

830
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:29,119
Should have recognized

831
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:30,143
Consequences

832
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:30,911
I had the off

833
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:31,935
Stepping back

834
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:33,727
Correct

835
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:36,287
Play Rosario de Lottery

836
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,055
Putin

837
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:38,079
Threw a tantrum

838
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:43,711
It seems like that's the most likely explanation that the people who have studied the case on it

839
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:49,855
Well that you look at

840
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:53,183
One of the one of the

841
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:54,975
I mean

842
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:58,047
What are the narratives that emerged with the Russian

843
00:46:59,071 --> 00:46:59,583
Into

844
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,607
The American election

845
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:02,911
And all that stuff

846
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:05,727
Was really just a very personal

847
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:07,519
I hate Hillary

848
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:08,543
Kind of reaction

849
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:09,567
So

850
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:15,711
Now makes a lot more sense with that context of him just throwing a tantrum

851
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:22,111
And ruining relations with the rest of the world stop by a little bit

852
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:23,903
Into a

853
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:29,791
I would say an incompletely drawn psychological profiles that we may want to work off of

854
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:34,911
I think you look at more of the details about it and I don't want to read you guys at 6

855
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:37,215
DuPage report anything like that

856
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:37,983
Tutor do that either

857
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:39,775
I had fault

858
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:42,079
But the shutting off

859
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:42,847
Of the gas

860
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,639
Was 100-percent Rush

861
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:48,991
Yeah they do in response to failed negotiations

862
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:50,271
Between Ukraine

863
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:51,039
And Russia

864
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:52,063
And

865
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:58,463
Ukraine was feeling

866
00:47:58,719 --> 00:47:59,999
It was coming through the pipeline

867
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,023
But it

868
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,559
Here's that most

869
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:05,887
They get a little hose and they siphon

870
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:09,471
Guy was breathing in real hard and put it in a gas can

871
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:12,799
A lot of it is really impossible to prove

872
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:14,335
Either way right

873
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,895
Ukraine's argument is

874
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:18,687
The gas that they're talking about

875
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:20,223
Is what's called

876
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:20,991
Sick

877
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:22,015
Operational

878
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:23,551
Which they were using

879
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:25,343
To power the pipeline

880
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:27,647
And create the ability to use

881
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:30,207
The transit flow

882
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:30,975
If the cost

883
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:33,023
Doing business eventually

884
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:38,399
In the transit of

885
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:41,471
It's incredibly complicated

886
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:44,031
From everything I can tell if you look at the reality

887
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,079
Ar100

888
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:49,663
When the stakes were so high

889
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:50,687
Four people in other

890
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,479
B

891
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:53,759
Also

892
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:55,551
Russia

893
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:56,831
The decision to shut off the gas

894
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:57,855
Which Alex

895
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:58,623
Is

896
00:48:59,135 --> 00:48:59,903
Putting the other direction

897
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:02,207
He sings Ukraine shut it off

898
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:03,231
It matters not

899
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:05,279
No one would make that Arc

900
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:08,863
Even on the 8th of January 2009

901
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:10,399
No one would make that are

902
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:12,959
Except

903
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:14,495
Bitsy

904
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,263
I hate

905
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:16,287
I hate this

906
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:17,055
Because

907
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:18,335
Obviously

908
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:20,383
We don't f******

909
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:26,527
Obviously it still could just be someone who's hyper sympathetic

910
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:28,831
To the Russian narrative

911
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:29,855
Rush's

912
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:30,623
World of

913
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:31,391
Are you

914
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:33,695
Has a boner for Putin to some extent

915
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:39,583
To me is that we talked about going on art

916
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:41,631
The Russian intelligence

917
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:42,399
Debriefing

918
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,191
Had to happen

919
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:45,727
Before 2009

920
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:51,359
Because it would never come out of his mouth if you wasn't super sympathetic to Russia

921
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:53,919
Fascinating

922
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:56,991
Just on a pure like

923
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:59,295
Where would you

924
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:01,087
Kind of level

925
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:02,623
There's no way to

926
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:05,439
Reeks

927
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:10,559
It's through approved

928
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:12,351
State-sponsored Rush

929
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:18,751
I do hang out with Paul Craig Roberts

930
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:24,895
He's at the Aronoff

931
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:28,991
Clearly a a Russian narrative

932
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:30,783
Where does he get it

933
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:31,807
He is either

934
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,623
Absorbing and watching Russian television

935
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:36,927
Constantly which is

936
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:38,975
Suspicious. In another self

937
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:41,279
If he's got

938
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:43,327
Direct

939
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:45,631
Relationship with people whose interest

940
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:46,911
Are aligned in that

941
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:49,215
Still don't think we have any

942
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:50,495
Kind of firm evidence

943
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:52,543
That there is a direct relationship

944
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:53,567
Past

945
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:55,615
The exploitation of

946
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:57,919
Flattery that they have

947
00:50:58,175 --> 00:51:02,783
Frere is Alex's story about that

948
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:04,319
Which I'm inclined to believe it is true

949
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:08,159
As we as we go further along I am leaning more towards

950
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:12,511
That's that the real narrative believe it's true because he's not that creative

951
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:13,791
No

952
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:17,887
We have millions of listeners

953
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:19,935
Concocting a setup

954
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:20,703
You fell for

955
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:22,495
Occurred

956
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:29,151
So I don't know man it's yes Next Level this is the reason going back to this

957
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:30,431
Specific Starpoint

958
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:32,991
And to see immediately that

959
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:34,015
Like

960
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:37,343
That narrative in the face of the reality

961
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:38,367
Is

962
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:39,647
Is troubling

963
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:41,439
And what's more troubling

964
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,975
Is to see it

965
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:45,791
Wheatley different man than we know in the present

966
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,071
Still Loving Rush

967
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:48,607
You don't like

968
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:51,423
The guy who is mad the cops

969
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:54,239
Kill the black guy who's innocent didn't deserve to die

970
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:56,031
And all this and he's mad about it

971
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:56,799
To go to jail

972
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:58,079
And he's still

973
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:06,527
Ukraine's f****** up here there

974
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:09,855
You know what I'm having I'm having the exact same revelation

975
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:11,391
That we did when we did the 22

976
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:13,183
Like

977
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:14,463
When we went back

978
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:15,743
And Alex was like

979
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:18,303
Some say Putin will save the world

980
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:19,839
Like before

981
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:25,983
He became on Pizza when I was surprised by that I'm super surprised

982
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:27,519
Yeah I'm super surprised to hear that

983
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:29,567
I'm not a surprise

984
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:31,359
About perhaps

985
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,127
A Russian

986
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:34,175
Are you sure

987
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,479
When did his dad move to this

988
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,063
There's a lot of

989
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,343
Really tough.

990
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:43,647
Figure out

991
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:49,279
This country don't know that either

992
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:51,327
So you won't be surprised to learn that

993
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:53,375
Really wanting money

994
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:57,727
Flavors so different

995
00:52:57,983 --> 00:52:59,775
He hasn't started his pill company

996
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:02,847
Selling DVDs

997
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:04,127
He's selling books

998
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,919
Yes

999
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:07,455
Some sponsors and I like we've seen

1000
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:10,015
Misshapen jeans

1001
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:13,855

00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:17,695
Always trying to make money

1004
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:22,303
Another issue

1005
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:32,799
Heisman 56 years

1006
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:34,335
Black rug

1007
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:35,359
Got broken

1008
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:39,199
And it's a favorite model

1009
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:44,575
Finished

1010
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:58,143
And he wants to

1011
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:15,807

1012
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:28,607
Show me state

1013
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:34,239

Even that like

1015
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:43,711
You should be getting the

1016
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:47,039
Feel like he's a man who's listening

1017
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:48,063
I'll tell you that right now

1018
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:49,343
It's possible

1019
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:51,135
Did the way he is

1020
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:53,183
Asking for money

1021
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:54,719
Working around money

1022
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:58,815
That's how human does it I want that

1023
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:02,655
Freedom Crusher Crusher one garage sale

1024

I want that bullhorn so bad you're not going to like how much

1025
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:15,455
Spoiler alert for the rest of the episodes

1026
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:18,783
So his old boat Boulevard

1027
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:22,367
She clearly had a scent

1028
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:25,183
Damage

1029
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:30,815
Find the loudest model

1030
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,095
Within the best

1031
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:35,423
Alright by that bullhorn

1032
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:37,983
Then it gets damaged decide no

1033
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:40,287
I am going to

1034
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:41,823
To turn this Boulevard

1035
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:43,359
Into my company's fee

1036
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:44,639
Exactly

1037
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:49,247
It seems to work cuz I don't want to I don't want to ruin thing but more

1038
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:53,087
I want a blunt

1039
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:57,951
Steal it I will steal it like a pack of Marlboro Red convertible

1040
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:59,743
Bullhorn

1041
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:04,351
That the government gets involved

1042
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:07,935
Put that spoiler

1043
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:11,007
The fastest spoiler for later

1044
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:16,639
You can't sell that boy doing

1045
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:17,663
Talkin about

1046
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:18,943
The Heyday of eBay

1047
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:19,967
A rhyme

1048
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:27,391
Back in about 2

1049
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:29,183
Nerve

1050
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:30,207
Hey

1051
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:34,815
This bullhorn is going to be

1052
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:41,727
Player in the show the guest a little bit they have on

1053
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:44,799
Google my notes out here and I just don't have any

1054
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:51,455
Eclipse on the interviews are inconsequential

1055
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:54,527
When you listen to 2009

1056
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:55,551
Alex Jones

1057
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:58,367
Design games

1058
00:56:58,879 --> 00:56:59,903
It is

1059
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:05,791
It becomes very clear to me that endgame was specifically like a best of documentary that he made

1060
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:08,863
Okay was just about the same thing

1061
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:10,655
Kantime

1062
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:13,471
Who's going to watch or endgame stuff you'll get most of it

1063
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:19,103
The greatest hits

1064
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:25,759
Listen to any of the Eagles regular album

1065
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:29,087
Didn't listen to their greatest hits album

1066
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:33,951
Investigation is going to be even greater album cut

1067
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:35,231
Like him

1068
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:40,607
Be mad at the cops for killing unarmed most people don't get to know

1069
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:41,887
Going to listen to the song

1070
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:44,703
Fleetwood Mac roads that were written by anybody who is any

1071
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:50,591
Sure he is Steve Quayle on who he knows written multiple books about how Giants used to walk the earth

1072
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:53,663
Crackpot

1073
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:56,991
He is a ironic

1074
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:02,111
He talks about how I

1075
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:09,023
It's all just like the end is here kind of stuff like that we're in a martial law state

1076
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:12,095
He has a good quote that they

1077
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:15,679
It was already signed the globalist sacrificed

1078
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:16,959
Live children

1079
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:19,263
If they'll take your guns if they'll take your life

1080
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:21,567
That's it

1081
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,103
He also

1082
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:28,479
The creator of Star Trek was the successor of Alice

1083
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:31,039
Ahead of the Oto

1084
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:36,671
The Ordo temple temple

1085
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:42,815
He has Paul Craig Roberts founder of Reaganomics

1086
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:45,375
Also gentleman

1087
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:46,143
Like weave

1088
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:47,167
Ghostwritten for

1089
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:48,959
Sputnik for years and years

1090
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:51,775
Also if you are the founder of Reaganomics urns

1091
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:54,591
Mostly just talk about economic collapse

1092
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:57,919
And that they were right on time

1093
00:58:58,431 --> 00:59:00,223
A little late

1094
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:02,271
Any talk about how it's going to get worse

1095
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:06,879
And then he has an hour-and-a-half unless there is some sort of massive stimulus package

1096
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:07,903
Pastor

1097
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:13,279
Hour-and-a-half interview with David Icke

1098
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:17,631
Not good

1099
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:18,655
Like it's just

1100
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:20,191
Just boring

1101
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:23,775
As much as I want to play clips of David Icke

1102
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:27,103
For you I would love to but

1103
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:29,407
Just nothing he should have been using a bowl

1104
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:30,943
It's absolutely nothing

1105
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:37,343
It's just it's just the two of them sort of he wants to talk about this

1106
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:38,367
Saying the word

1107
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:40,927
The only thing

1108
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:43,487
I said that I thought was like

1109
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:47,327
Lizards

1110
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:49,631
Money's on Alex's show

1111
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:50,911
Close to the vest

1112
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:56,031
People like Barack Obama are white people in black bodies

1113
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:57,311
And that made me a bit

1114
00:59:58,335 --> 00:59:59,359
I don't know what that means

1115
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:03,711
I don't either but he says he was quoting somebody else but I couldn't

1116
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:05,759
I couldn't make out who he was saying

1117
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:07,807
Hazel I just I don't have the clip of it

1118
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:09,855
I would have researched who he was quoting

1119
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:10,623
But it's a

1120
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:13,951
Is a battery

1121
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:18,559
So he gets done with David Icke

1122
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:20,095
I'm going to get back to the Bohol

1123
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:23,679
What is the surprised well it's not

1124
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:28,543
Alex Jones

1125
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:38,527
A Scanner Darkly

1126
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:40,575
Yep

1127
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:44,927
Nope you got play equip just to prove that he was in the movie know you're in the movie Alex

1128
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:45,695
It's not

1129
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:46,463
Cares

1130
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:47,487
I don't know I like it

1131
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:52,607
Movie memorabilia

1132
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:00,543
Obviously it's a fundraiser

1133
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:01,567
Megaphone

1134
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:04,127
Just as a megaphone is worth 3000

1135
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:07,967
$500

1136
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:15,903
So he's important things going on here

1137
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:22,047
I caught it but

1138
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:23,327
I'm still

1139
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:24,095
Struggling

1140
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:25,887
Wrap my head around that fat

1141
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:32,543
Pretty good name for a boy

1142
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:34,335
He has to keep talking about it

1143
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:41,503
I was living in a world where you can just say it's a pretty good name for a bullhorn and everybody's like and then we move on

1144
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:48,927
Same thing to say right you not concerned about what the surprise is

1145
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:49,695
Surprise

1146
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:56,095
This is that this is going to sell for a lot of money for my notes here's the note that I have from

1147
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:57,375
This time

1148
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:00,703
Alex's big surprise

1149
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:04,543
Also still trying to sell that bull

1150
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:10,175
Still trying to sell that board so it's going back through them like

1151
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:12,735
He didn't have a surprise

1152
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:15,551
I couldn't remember what does the price

1153
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:17,087
And then I remembered

1154
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:17,855
The surprise

1155
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:19,391
Charlie Sheen gave him a jacket

1156
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:28,863
This is big surprise

1157
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:36,031
Really

1158
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:41,151
Jacqueline Naomi not be true

1159
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:42,687
So Alex is also

1160
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:46,271
Wolverines

1161
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:49,087
People did not understand the point of that movie

1162
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:53,951
Allegory analysis super excited

1163
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:57,791
To tell everyone that he has Charlie Sheen

1164
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:02,655
In the context of I go over

1165
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:05,215
I will not

1166
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:14,431
Alright

1167
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:20,831
Alright

1168
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:21,855
Heroic

1169
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:26,975
Zoe

1170
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:27,743
To play some

1171
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:29,023
Clips from Red Dawn

1172
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:41,311
You know I used to listen to Alex a long time ago cuz I thought it was funny I'm like

1173
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:44,127
I cuz I never do know I'm always like this

1174
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:45,151
Is a f******

1175
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:49,759
Saying racist monster

1176
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:56,415
This is pretty funny keep in mind but keep in mind that this is like A4

1177
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:59,999
Flower show in 20 minutes of it opens at 2

1178
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:06,655
Listen to Thursday repetitive commercials

1179
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:07,423
A bullhorn

1180
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:08,703
Named

1181
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:10,495
Not selling

1182
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:14,335
Great radio

1183
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:17,919
Eclipse from Red Dawn

1184
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:18,687
Mad over them

1185
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:30,207
Russia Today

1186
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:35,071
Flowers

1187
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:36,607
Smooth

1188
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:39,167
It's like Silk

1189
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:53,503
Election coverage that's so great

1190
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:54,783
So happy

1191
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:58,367
Very pretty good loving

1192
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:00,671
This is a man

1193
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:04,511
Who's getting paid to play clips from Red.

1194
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:07,327
I think if anything

1195
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:08,351
Alex Jones

1196
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:13,727
We'll see what else we end up learning through this like 2,000

1197
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:18,847
But I think you should live on in everyone's memory not as a racist propaganda

1198
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:19,871
Because he is

1199
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:21,407
But I think

1200
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:23,711
More importantly to all of our hearts

1201
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:26,271
You should serve as a cautionary Tale

1202
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:27,551
Like Icarus

1203
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:29,343
Take

1204
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:30,111
Superman lights

1205
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:30,879
What is that

1206
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:33,695
But also like Icarus he flew too close to the Sun

1207
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:34,463
You know like

1208
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:36,767
Whatever it is it

1209
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:38,303
Probably lost for money

1210
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:40,095
For whatever

1211
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:42,655
He got money and he wanted more more

1212
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:48,031
Luxurious

1213
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:51,615
When the happiest you could possibly ever be is right around here

1214
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:54,943
He's making enough money to live as a fanbase

1215
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:55,711
He's getting

1216
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:57,247
Do whatever the f*** he wants

1217
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:59,295
Free to see a bunch

1218
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:05,439
No one's going to

1219
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:07,999
Like for us

1220
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:11,071
Getting to the point where it's just like

1221
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:17,215
We have enough donations so you can pay your rent

1222
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:19,519
Everything from here

1223
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:24,639
Being rich doesn't Charming

1224
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:26,687
I know it sucks not really

1225
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:28,735
This is it this is great for us

1226
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:30,783
If we ever do become successful

1227
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:36,927
Immediately were both going to be like

1228
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:37,951
35

1229
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:41,791
Jordan

1230
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:42,815
I'm selling broken

1231
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:44,607
Megaphone

1232
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:45,887
What's

1233
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:51,007
I don't respond to name megaphones just bullhorn

1234
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:55,871
What's a What's the difference between a megaphone

1235
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:56,895
Just a tube

1236
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:59,967
You put your mouth at the base of

1237
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:06,111
And it amplifies your voice

1238
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:09,183
Like a like a cone basically that you ride yellow

1239
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:12,511
The bullhole

1240
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:17,119
Anyway

1241
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:18,911
You know what I do know

1242
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:21,983
Is

1243
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:23,007
A f******

1244
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:25,567
Gold sales

1245
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:27,103
In 2009

1246
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:31,455
V level

1247
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:32,991
The level to which

1248
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:34,527
He is incorporating by 23

1249
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:37,343
Resources without disclosing their relationship

1250
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:39,391
Do you mean that they own him entirely yeah

1251
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:40,415
It's crazy

1252
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:41,951
Like

1253
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:48,351
Almost every show with Ted Anderson coming in and telling him about what bullion he's bought like

1254
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:51,679
Couple of Frank's buffalo coin

1255
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:55,775
TV show on

1256
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:58,591
On Fox News bringing in a lawyer that he has

1257
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:01,663
Nevermind

1258
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:04,991
It's just crazy no correlation

1259
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:08,063
And I want to stress like

1260
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:10,623
She had on a half-hour interview with Paul Craig Roberts

1261
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:12,415
It's just about like the economy collapse

1262
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:13,439
And stuff like that

1263
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:16,511
Towards the end of the show

1264
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:18,047
Can a word wear a good

1265
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:20,607
Three and a half hours into the show now he brings in

1266
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:41,087
Real quick he says it there a sponsor but that's not really a cure

1267
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:42,879
That is not

1268
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:45,951
I've looked there an ownership group

1269
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:46,975
I've looked a little bit

1270
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:47,743
Into the f

1271
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:49,023
CC's guidelines

1272
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:50,047
In terms of like

1273
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:52,095
How you supposed to represent bonds

1274
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:54,655
Their ships and stuff like that and spiritually

1275
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:56,703
I think this is a crime

1276
01:08:57,471 --> 01:09:03,615
I don't like a legitimately I can't I can't say for sure if you take a little more research on my

1277
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:05,407
Part

1278
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:07,455
He's being syndicated by

1279
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:08,991
The guys company

1280
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:11,039
And not disclosing that

1281
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:14,367
That is a an unfair representation of their

1282
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:15,391
Jaz Sinclair

1283
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:16,159
Who cares

1284
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:25,631
Under the price of batteries

1285
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:45,087
I did I was able to even be a little bit on the British side

1286
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:45,855
Frank's right now

1287
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:46,879
The French franc

1288
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:48,671
204 the British sovereign

1289
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:49,951
2

1290
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:58,655
Yeah comparatively speaking I did a little check on it I was looking to see where

1291
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:04,031
That's really boring stuff but the point that I wanted to keep it in the end there was that Alex

1292
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:04,799
This is like talk

1293
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:05,567
Can price-point

1294
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:08,895
He's very aware of the business

1295
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:16,575
Absolute football gold at

1296
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:20,159
35% of what it is that it would be on the market

1297
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:22,463
How can you get away with these prices.

1298
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:27,583
We're going to have to put a clock on this

1299
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:31,679
We're going to put a clock cuz we're going to sell out of gold we're going to sell out of French Francs

1300
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:33,215
I don't know if those are gold

1301
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:33,983
But that's fine

1302
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:37,055
Where can I buy you got an hour call in now

1303
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:40,127
We're going to sell out this is not like

1304
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:40,895
Call Tom

1305
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:43,711
Samurai swords

1306
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:44,479
Which are

1307
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:45,759
Made out of

1308
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:47,551
Frank francophiles

1309
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:49,855
Frank's butt

1310
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:50,623
People who like

1311
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:52,159
Isn't closed

1312
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:53,695
Acceptable broadcast Behavior

1313
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:54,719
It's

1314
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:03,423
Slightly unaware of the business and just letting TED Talk

1315
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:05,983
I haven't talked

1316
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:14,175
That would be slightly different but he's doing it like a like I mean it's not funny but it's like

1317
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:19,295
And that we jump into the night

1318
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:22,879
If you have been confused up till now

1319
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:27,231
Just going to get more students going to get so much worse

1320
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:28,767
When I get to it

1321
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:32,351
Still hasn't finished

1322
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:35,423
All right but at the beginning of this show Alex Jones

1323
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:36,447
Talks about

1324
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:37,727
The president

1325
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:40,799
Who's there

1326
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:45,663
And Alex is a big fan of in present day

1327
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:56,671
Policies for death camps and rounding up population

1328
01:11:57,439 --> 01:12:00,511
Non-aryan gription Russia and on all over Europe

1329
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:04,607
American Indian program

1330
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:07,423
Here in the United States

1331
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:15,871
It was Andrew Jackson

1332
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:22,783
Not a laughing

1333
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:29,695
Google's not great but but the awareness there is that Andrew Jackson

1334
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:33,791
That's weird

1335
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:37,375
That's very weird still the problem

1336
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:42,495
Does know something about history at this point

1337
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:48,895
All of these sources

1338
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:56,063
Willfully lies about the probably heard before after 2009

1339
01:12:56,319 --> 01:13:01,439
That's the thing like on the stupid flash evil Continuum that we often disagree upon

1340
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:05,023
You know is his reading comprehension

1341
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:09,631
You misunderstand all of these things

1342
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:11,423
Now if you get

1343
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:14,239
If you can read the history of Andrew Jackson

1344
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:15,519
He is a f******

1345
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:16,543
Monster

1346
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:22,431
And then report that like a reasonable human being later on

1347
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:24,223
You are willfully lie

1348
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:26,527
About Andrew Jackson and all of this

1349
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:29,343
Willfully lying about all of these

1350
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:32,415
Primary sources that you say you understand

1351
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:33,695
Because you can

1352
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:36,511
It is you it is within your capabilities

1353
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:39,071
America is

1354
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:40,351
Genocide

1355
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:44,447
I disagree I don't think it's that cut-and-dry because that's such a simple conclusion

1356
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:45,983
You know like

1357
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:49,567
You could read a children coloring book and find out that Andrew Jack

1358
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:51,359
Text Melissa genocider

1359
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:53,407
You know if we should publish a

1360
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:55,967
A series of knowledge fight coloring books that talk about

1361
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:56,735

Brujeria unmarketable

1364
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:04,927
Doesn't that doesn't indicate too much

1365
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:08,511
Children's book go the fuc to

1366
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:12,607
To Sleep America's version to hell

1367
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:14,655
Something along those lines grow the f***

Oh really is that it

1398
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:57,567
He believes that a government agent

1399
01:15:57,823 --> 01:16:03,455
He was trying to f*** with him by putting in a troll

1400
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:08,831
Gmail

1401
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:11,647
I prefer a government that does that.

1402
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:15,487
Control Alex Jones

1403
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:16,255
In that

1404
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:22,911

You know 2009 is where you're getting

1411
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:43,135
Beginnings of people figuring out

1412
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:44,415
Like really good ways

1413
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:45,951
The f*** with people on the internet

1414
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:48,511
And maybe Alex Jones

1415
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:51,071

Was just f******

1419
01:16:58,495 --> 01:17:02,079
Absolute most likely government

1420
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:05,663
Do not stop Alex

1421
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:06,431
From spiraling

1422
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:08,735
Vicious rain

1423
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:10,271
About these people

1424
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:12,319
Open internet

1425
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:19,487

You're mine

1431
01:17:58,399 --> 01:17:59,423
So you couldn't connect

1432

Your intellect with your soul

1433
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:01,983
Wow

1434
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:02,751
That's

1435
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:03,519
Weird

1436
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:12,223
Something like that I need to bring up that I have discovered Vermont

1437
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:14,271
2009

1438
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:16,063
Alex

1439
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:17,599
He's been against

1440
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:20,415
The whole time

1441
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:22,719
There was a part of me

1442
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:29,119
Vet like I used to listen to the show when I was younger and

1443
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:30,655
And I kind of fun and everything

1444
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:31,423
But like

1445
01:18:32,191 --> 01:18:32,703
I didn't

1446
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:34,239
Understand

1447
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:35,775
Can you put in that bed

1448
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:41,919
What I didn't do that I did not work for satcom

1449
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:47,295
From the jump like I didn't realize that this is a decade-long battle against these again

1450
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:53,695
He doesn't talk about it much but I thought that was a newer

1451
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:56,511
Wrinkle in his world like a cosmology the

1452
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:58,047
Oh there's devil

1453
01:18:58,303 --> 01:19:00,351
Literal Christian death

1454
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:02,655
Behind all of this

1455
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:09,823
I'm I I I assumed immediately bring up the devil

1456
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:14,175
Set up crew

1457
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:25,183
Yeah but he clearly wasn't born again this is s*** that he's grown up with

1458
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:27,999
I bet in

1459
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:31,071
He has a grandma talked about the devil

1460
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:31,839
Non-Stop

1461
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:33,887
Early 2000s

1462
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:34,911
He wasn't

1463
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:36,959
Overly talking about

1464
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:39,263
Satan is behind all these people I don't like

1465
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:43,615
Given our interview at the end of the show with the guy name

1466
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:44,895
Not Alan Watts

1467
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:47,967
Be Alan Watts know Alan Watts is the other guy

1468
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:57,439
Inspirational speaker through find video

1469
01:19:57,695 --> 01:20:03,839
Leo's of giving flowing speeches about human potential

1470
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:11,519
He's probably behind a lot of Alex's

1471
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:12,287
Endgame

1472
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:15,360
Honestly cuz everytime it comes on the show

1473
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:16,896
It's just the plot of a

1474
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:20,736
On this appearance here on the 9th

1475
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:22,272
January 9th 2009

1476
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:24,832
He is literally talking about the Christian

1477
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,392
Being behind

1478
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:28,416

1479
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:29,952

Intellect not being connected to

To your soul.

1483
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:40,704
There

1484
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:46,080
It's about the intellect

1485
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:49,152
Breastmilk baby

1486
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:49,920
Suspicious

1487
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:53,760
Yeah we are reviewed studies

1488
01:20:54,272 --> 01:21:00,416
What depends a base of 15 to 30%

1489
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:05,536
Lotion depends on study

1490
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,632
Complaining about these people launched

1491
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:13,984
Into this tirade by the troll bid on his

1492
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:17,312
No it's bad not breast

1493
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:20,640
Do some groups of people behave

1494
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:30,880
Got you all arrogant John smiley face

1495
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:33,184
Devil

The Cowardly

1497
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:35,744
Devil

1498
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:40,864
Metrosexual

1499
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:46,240
But at least we know he still home or something

1500
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:52,384
Those women abortions

1501
01:21:57,248 --> 01:21:59,808
Can I get a new car every two years

1502
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:05,184
Honey

1503
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:10,048
So

Goodwill where can I order

1505
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:20,032
Misogynistic

1506
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:24,128
Women with their abortions I've only paid for like 15 of them

1507
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:28,480
Something like that every two years

1508
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:29,760
Every dude

1509
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:30,784
Another abortion

1510
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:38,720
What is right

1511
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:41,536
Also remember when

1512
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:47,936
People used to complain about metrosexual

1513
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:54,592
Like they're not moving from the 50s

1514
01:22:55,872 --> 01:22:56,384
Jeans

1515
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:57,152
Dan

1516
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:58,432
Their jeans fit

1517
01:22:58,944 --> 01:23:00,480
You should get random GLG

1518
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:01,760
Absolutely

1519
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,368
Jordan

1520
01:23:09,696 --> 01:23:11,232
You're going to get in

1521
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:17,120
I don't know what to

1522
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:19,680
Alex Jones

1523
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:20,448
First gas

1524
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:21,728
No on the 9th

1525
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:22,752
I'm out

1526
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:24,288
The guy by the name

1527
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:25,056
Russell

1528
01:23:26,592 --> 01:23:27,872
The name meaning

1529
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:29,408
Means

1530
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:31,712
He is a Native American Act

1531
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:32,480
Activists

1532
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:35,808
Who's been doing sit-ins in occupations of like

1533
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:36,576
Potraz

1534
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:38,112
Other location

1535
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:39,392
Since the lights

1536
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:44,256
So far am I bored

1537
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:45,280
Hotel right

1538
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:48,608
Original people

1539
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:53,472
Use on a

1540
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:06,016
Reasonable scientist remember

1541
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:11,392
Batman

1542
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:14,720
Being Adele was Italy still use a broadcast

1543
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,328
Write to you as he was utterly bewildered by

1544
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:24,448
What do you mean

1545
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:29,568
He has

1546
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:32,128
Support them

1547
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:34,432
In terms of Native American issues

1548
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:40,320
First Peoples Jewelers

1549
01:24:43,136 --> 01:24:43,904
It's the Rothschild

1550
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:53,632
One who is entire life

1551
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:54,400
About

1552
01:24:55,936 --> 01:24:57,216
Trying to get rights

1553
01:24:57,472 --> 01:24:59,008
For a minority

1554
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:00,544
Which

1555
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:01,312
Shwayze

1556
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:06,944
What do you do somebody like a we have a

1557
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:10,016
Massive speaker who is

1558
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:14,112
Tirelessly tirelessly campaigning for equal pay for women

1559
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:18,720
Will not f****** give it up and they do so much good in their life

1560
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:21,280
You find out it's like

1561
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:25,376
Is because

1562
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:27,168
Everyone who doesn't

1563
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:31,520
And you're like

1564
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:38,688
Support what you're doing I'm just going to look over this one part where you think it's the devil

1565
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:47,904
I'm not concerned about where Russell's motivation

1566
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:48,928
Comes from

1567
01:25:49,184 --> 01:25:50,976
Or whatever dumb ideas

1568
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:52,256
Become beholder

1569
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:53,280
Too late in life

1570
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:56,864
He was on that tape in the mid-late 60s

1571
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:01,984
I don't

1572
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:03,776
I will say that I did not have time

1573
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:07,104
To do a massive deep.

1574
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:09,408
But from what I could gather

1575
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:13,504
Russell Means

1576
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:14,272
Great name

1577
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:16,320
Russell Means

1578
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:17,856
Freedom

1579
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:20,416
I like that that's clever

1580
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:21,184
I don't

1581
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:22,976
I don't judge

1582
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:24,256
The Rothschilds

1583
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:26,816
Narrative becoming a piece of his thing

1584
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:27,840
I'm not

1585
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:29,888
I don't give a s*** about

1586
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:34,752
2009 Alex Jones had a

1587
01:26:35,008 --> 01:26:37,568
Native American activist on the show

1588
01:26:37,824 --> 01:26:38,848
And he was like

1589
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:43,968
He was on but he wasn't talking about how it's a plan

1590
01:26:44,224 --> 01:26:47,296
Just separate us in bulk and Isaac divide-and-conquer

1591
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:48,320
He's Native American

1592
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:52,928
Global is just trying to make people feel guilty

1593
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:55,488
It wasn't even like that

1594
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:56,512
From Apple

1595
01:26:56,768 --> 01:26:57,792
Position of like

1596
01:26:58,560 --> 01:26:59,840
I agree with you

1597
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:01,632
And that's nuts

1598
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:03,936
Now this next clip

1599
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:05,216
Is even more

1600
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:14,688
Right now

1601
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:15,712
All God's Children

1602
01:27:43,104 --> 01:27:43,616
So

1603
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:51,296
Dark humor

1604
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:54,368
That's just him that's just

1605
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:55,392
Letting the past

1606
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:56,160
I think

1607
01:28:01,024 --> 01:28:01,536
Alright

1608
01:28:03,072 --> 01:28:03,840
That's nuts

1609
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:05,120
Spetsnaz

1610
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:07,680
Who is this

1611
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:15,872
There's so many other there's a couple other instances that were garbled and

1612
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:17,664
Listen to much longer clips

1613
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:19,456
Yeah in order to get the

1614
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:21,248
The sound byte to make sense

1615
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:23,808
But there are a number of other points where he's

1616
01:28:24,064 --> 01:28:24,576
Like

1617
01:28:25,088 --> 01:28:26,368
F****** critical of Israel

1618
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:29,696
I want to take away for this clip

1619
01:28:29,952 --> 01:28:32,000
Is a very strong message

1620
01:28:32,512 --> 01:28:33,792
Do all of the people

1621
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:34,560
Out there

1622
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:37,376
Who claimed that Alex Jones refuses

1623
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:39,168
To talk about Israel

1624
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:40,448
Go fuc yourself

1625
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:41,728
He does

1626
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:44,800
At least in 2009

1627
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:48,384
I don't know how how this changes over time or whatever but like

1628
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:49,408
Him saying

1629
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:52,480
They're killing the Gaza peep the people in Gaza

1630
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:53,248
Like that

1631
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:57,856
That's as far as you need to go for a at least a first step

1632
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:01,440
That is that something that if he was

1633
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:05,792
As his critics is

1634
01:29:06,048 --> 01:29:06,816
Never f******

1635
01:29:07,072 --> 01:29:09,120
Say something like that

1636
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:11,424
Most

1637
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:13,216
All people

1638
01:29:13,472 --> 01:29:19,104
No matter how liberal professor

1639
01:29:19,616 --> 01:29:23,456
We're still avoiding the topic of Israel's war crimes

1640
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:25,760
As much as humanly possible

1641
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:31,136
It doesn't matter who you are like

1642
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:35,488
The fact that Alex is at

1643
01:29:37,792 --> 01:29:39,328
Yes

1644
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:41,376
Is literally coming out

1645
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:44,448
And saying that Israel is committing war crimes

1646
01:29:44,704 --> 01:29:45,728
At a time.

1647
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:47,776
Where Obama would not even

1648
01:29:48,032 --> 01:29:49,056
Talk about that s***

1649
01:29:49,312 --> 01:29:52,384
If you brought up Israel

1650
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:55,200
You know and then moved on its back

1651
01:29:58,016 --> 01:30:01,344
There are

1652
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:03,648
On that tip

1653
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:06,464
Around this time

1654
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:09,024
I don't either I don't either and I

1655
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:14,144
It almost feels like we need to do a spin off show about Alex

1656
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:19,008
In 2009 that is not related to the knowledge fight show

1657
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:22,592
Lele different person

1658
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:23,872
Sure about the present

1659
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:27,200
Like it's just like we said in the last episode it's all just

1660
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:28,224
All this

1661
01:30:28,736 --> 01:30:32,064
Obfuscating a dump much rather figure out

1662
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:33,600
Where does the breaking

1663
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:35,904
Come

1664
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:38,208
It wasn't true

1665
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:42,048
No because 2015

1666
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:43,072
He was a

1667
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:46,912
He was he was a

1668
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:51,008
The day after the Charleston shooting

1669
01:30:51,264 --> 01:30:52,288
He said well

1670
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:58,944
Sky really wanted to be racist

1671
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:00,480
2015

1672
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:02,272
Have you been summoned before

1673
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:03,808
Everything went wrong

1674
01:31:06,368 --> 01:31:06,880
Xbox

1675
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:08,928
Is like this guy

1676
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:10,976
They were listening to in 2009

1677
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:12,000
Does.

1678
01:31:12,512 --> 01:31:13,024
He sucks

1679
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:25,056
Bureaucratic of mine you just weren't breast

1680
01:31:25,312 --> 01:31:26,336
Sad

1681
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:27,616
Dick

1682
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:30,176
And he's clearly a manipulative

1683
01:31:30,432 --> 01:31:33,504
Gold salesman / broken bullhorn salesman

1684
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:34,272
Course

1685
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:35,040
But

1686
01:31:36,064 --> 01:31:37,344
The nearest

1687
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:38,624
Tough job to get it is

1688
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:40,672
Really hard to become a broken bone

1689
01:31:41,184 --> 01:31:42,976
Double major

1690
01:31:43,744 --> 01:31:45,792
Narrative

1691
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:47,840
You don't like that with

1692
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:51,424
The cop shooting of Oscar Grant

1693
01:31:51,936 --> 01:31:52,448
With

1694
01:31:53,728 --> 01:31:55,008
Think about Israel bombing

1695
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:56,544
People in Gaza

1696
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:57,824
And it's murder

1697
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:59,104
Do something

1698
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:00,128
All things you

1699
01:32:00,384 --> 01:32:00,896
You could talk about

1700
01:32:01,408 --> 01:32:02,944
You know like nowadays

1701
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:05,504
Nothing he talks about you can talk about

1702
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:10,112
Nothing

1703
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:12,416
So many times of like

1704
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:16,512
If you if you are on the right it's not like I I hate

1705
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:19,328
Conservatives are right-wing people

1706
01:32:19,584 --> 01:32:21,632
So much as it is like

1707
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:26,752
They should just be ignored because if you can't have a conversation about what the best way to tackle

1708
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:29,824
If you if you aren't willing to be like

1709
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:30,592
Well

1710
01:32:30,848 --> 01:32:33,664
Here's a here's how we should tackle it versus how

1711
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:34,688
You want to tackle

1712
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:35,968
That's a conversation

1713
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:38,272
If you just say it doesn't exist

1714
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:46,464
Okay well how do we tackle this police brutality issue

1715
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:51,072
F****** power of these people

1716
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:54,400
Clearly built with clearly

1717
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:56,704
Soupremacy that we're just not packed

1718
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:57,728
This is Malik

1719
01:32:57,984 --> 01:33:00,288
You can actually have a conversation with

1720
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:01,568
About how

1721
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:02,848
To correct these

1722
01:33:03,104 --> 01:33:04,384
Issues

1723
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:08,992
What the issues are

1724
01:33:09,248 --> 01:33:11,040
How old is this guy goes from

1725
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:12,832
Is it is it really just

1726
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:13,856
Team sports

1727
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:17,184
I don't think that all it really is

1728
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:21,280
I don't know is it just that people

1729
01:33:21,536 --> 01:33:22,816
From whatever

1730
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:26,656
Knowledge I have of the other episodes

1731
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:33,056
I don't know I don't know

1732
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:34,848
It's fresh

1733
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:37,152
Is this

1734
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:43,552
Yeah so don't be scared

1735
01:33:43,808 --> 01:33:45,600
Do this.

1736
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:56,864
The cell New York

1737
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:19,648
I would argue that the people who are the people who offered

1738
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:26,048
Look at these shity white dudes manipulating people

1739
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:30,144
I don't know if Alex is getting the wrong lesson from very basic history

1740
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:33,728
But it seems like he might be thinking that everyone's laughing

1741
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:36,032
As opposed to

1742
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:44,224
60 if you if you fall into

1743
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:50,880
But you did hear Russell laugh

1744
01:34:53,952 --> 01:34:56,512
Spirit behind it

1745
01:35:01,376 --> 01:35:02,144
So little later

1746
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:03,936
Alex Jones has a visit

1747
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:05,984
Someone we know very well

1748
01:35:06,496 --> 01:35:07,264
A dear friend of ours

1749
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:10,336
Such a weird that

1750
01:35:12,384 --> 01:35:12,896
Justin Bieber

1751
01:35:13,152 --> 01:35:13,920
Kia of a man who

1752
01:35:14,176 --> 01:35:15,712
He still says wobble

1753
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:16,992
Yeah

1754
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:18,272
Just that concept

1755
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:19,552
And it's not like a half

1756
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:28,256
Wampum is a totally legitimate thing to say

1757
01:35:28,512 --> 01:35:30,048
Using it for effect

1758
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:31,072
You know.

1759
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:33,120
No I think he

1760
01:35:33,376 --> 01:35:36,448
Uses it like conversationally

1761
01:35:36,704 --> 01:35:37,728
We don't have enough contact

1762
01:35:37,984 --> 01:35:39,520
I would argue that I sent

1763
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:42,080
Tim saying

1764
01:35:42,592 --> 01:35:44,640
Hey at least it Wounded Knee that killed all the children

1765
01:35:44,896 --> 01:35:46,432
United States

1766
01:35:46,688 --> 01:35:52,320
But I think it's that same sort of

1767
01:35:53,344 --> 01:35:53,856
You know I'm saying

1768
01:35:54,112 --> 01:35:56,416
I would I would go

1769
01:35:56,928 --> 01:36:02,304
I'm giving it a lot of leeway because of the other stuff

1770
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:03,584
Cure ignorance

1771
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:04,352
Of like

1772
01:36:04,608 --> 01:36:05,120
Well

1773
01:36:05,632 --> 01:36:10,752
There's nothing wrong with saying that's a normal thing that happened in 1940s

1774
01:36:11,008 --> 01:36:11,776
So it clearly

1775
01:36:15,104 --> 01:36:15,616
We had a visit

1776
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:18,432
Buddy

1777
01:36:18,944 --> 01:36:19,456
Body of Art

1778
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:21,504
Jesus

1779
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:23,040
Larry Stevie Larry Nicks

1780
01:36:23,296 --> 01:36:24,832
Still haven't

1781
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:28,928
Sleeping around

1782
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:33,792
Steve pieczenik is in play at some point

1783
01:36:34,048 --> 01:36:36,352
World

1784
01:36:36,608 --> 01:36:39,168
Paul Craig Roberts people like Gerald Celente

1785
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:40,960
Are much more regular gas

1786
01:36:41,216 --> 01:36:41,984
This point

1787
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:43,008
Haha

1788
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:44,544
Have to show up at some point

1789
01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:46,336
Pretty soon

1790
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:52,736
Eagerly awaited

1791
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:56,064
I'm getting all these episodes

1792
01:36:58,624 --> 01:36:59,648
Nothing is label

1793
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:02,464
Like in terms of the episodes

1794
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:06,816
And stuff like that so nothing going in listening to this episode

1795
01:37:07,584 --> 01:37:08,352
Thankfully

1796
01:37:08,608 --> 01:37:10,400
When Alex Jones is broadcast career

1797
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:15,520
He starts every show by Buena Vista

1798
01:37:15,776 --> 01:37:19,104
Until I can get a sense of plastic

1799
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:20,640
A b

1800
01:37:22,688 --> 01:37:24,224
With modern episodes

1801
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:26,016
You know up to about like

1802
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:28,576
A 2013 or so you can find them on YouTube

1803
01:37:28,832 --> 01:37:31,392
Can I go see who the guests are

1804
01:37:31,648 --> 01:37:34,208
Hamamoto let's do this thing

1805
01:37:34,464 --> 01:37:37,536
Where is now I'm like I'm Flying Blind

1806
01:37:40,864 --> 01:37:41,888
Pink is not in play

1807
01:37:42,144 --> 01:37:44,448
I think he's came around in like 20-30

1808
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:45,472
Universal

1809
01:37:45,728 --> 01:37:47,520
I think I'm not entirely sure but

1810
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:53,920
Ratibor shows up randomly that be exciting as f*** weird like

1811
01:37:54,176 --> 01:38:00,320
Racism is like his blue. Like weird artists

1812
01:38:00,576 --> 01:38:01,088
Character Arc

1813
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:07,488
Throughout this whole thing

1814
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:11,584
Post-modernism this is when Alex was a pointillist like this is bananas

1815
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:16,960
Because I think we have tapped into

1816
01:38:17,728 --> 01:38:18,496
To some extent

1817
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:20,800
A villain origin story

1818
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:24,384
This point you do see the remnant

1819
01:38:26,688 --> 01:38:28,992
They're only remnants because we know

1820
01:38:29,248 --> 01:38:31,552
The future

1821
01:38:31,808 --> 01:38:33,856
Do Steve the Colonel's rationality

1822
01:38:34,112 --> 01:38:35,136
Do the kernels of like

1823
01:38:37,696 --> 01:38:39,232
And then you see the kernels of delightful

1824
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:41,024
What the riding along with the highway

1825
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:43,328
The talking about stealing beer at a car

1826
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:46,144
Like

1827
01:38:47,936 --> 01:38:48,704
Sure

1828
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:49,472
Sure.

1829
01:38:49,728 --> 01:38:50,240
That's a great movie

1830
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:53,312
It's wise as it goes along I think we're going to see

1831
01:38:53,824 --> 01:38:55,616
A man get worse and worse and worse

1832
01:38:56,896 --> 01:38:58,176
I don't know there's no other

1833
01:38:58,432 --> 01:38:59,200
There's no other Direct

1834
01:38:59,712 --> 01:39:02,528
Either that or for some reason like some

1835
01:39:03,552 --> 01:39:04,320
Let's say

1836
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:06,112
We continue this investigation

1837
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:07,904
Turns out in 2010

1838
01:39:09,952 --> 01:39:10,464
In this way

1839
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:11,488
Weird like

1840
01:39:12,256 --> 01:39:12,768
Woke

1841
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:14,560
In his words

1842
01:39:15,072 --> 01:39:16,352
Classical liberal

1843
01:39:16,608 --> 01:39:17,120
Concept

1844
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:18,912
Crushin it

1845
01:39:19,424 --> 01:39:20,960
And then something bad has

1846
01:39:21,728 --> 01:39:23,264
Like he falls into a vat of acid

1847
01:39:23,776 --> 01:39:25,568
Something along those lines like something

1848
01:39:25,824 --> 01:39:28,640
Horrific him into the monster that

1849
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:32,480
You don't know

1850
01:39:32,736 --> 01:39:33,504
Got hit by meteor

1851
01:39:35,808 --> 01:39:37,088
Murdered by the globalist

1852
01:39:37,344 --> 01:39:38,112
And replace

1853
01:39:38,368 --> 01:39:38,880
With an

1854
01:39:39,136 --> 01:39:39,648
And Alex Jones

1855
01:39:39,904 --> 01:39:40,416
Chimera

1856
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:42,464
I have called it right now

1857
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:44,512
That's

1858
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:46,048
That we know today

1859
01:39:46,304 --> 01:39:47,328
Was grown

1860
01:39:47,584 --> 01:39:48,096
Innate

1861
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:51,424
Cow uterus or whatever it is

1862
01:39:55,264 --> 01:39:57,056
Think about like a life event

1863
01:39:57,312 --> 01:39:57,824
Would have happened

1864
01:39:59,104 --> 01:39:59,616
Divorce

1865
01:40:00,128 --> 01:40:01,408
The big event that happened help

1866
01:40:01,664 --> 01:40:03,968
But I don't lose that like 2350

1867
01:40:04,992 --> 01:40:08,320
Was formalized falling apart

1868
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:10,112
For a while before that

1869
01:40:10,368 --> 01:40:12,160
That would be that would actually be

1870
01:40:12,416 --> 01:40:13,696
The least appealing narrative

1871
01:40:13,952 --> 01:40:15,488
To me if we go back

1872
01:40:15,744 --> 01:40:17,792
It turns out that around when

1873
01:40:18,048 --> 01:40:19,840
The marriage fell apart

1874
01:40:20,352 --> 01:40:21,376
He lost his mind

1875
01:40:21,632 --> 01:40:23,168
Is that it's just like

1876
01:40:23,424 --> 01:40:24,960
Such a bummer

1877
01:40:25,216 --> 01:40:27,008
Happy story

1878
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:28,032
You kind of want it to

1879
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:29,312
To have more

1880
01:40:29,568 --> 01:40:30,080
Drama

1881
01:40:31,872 --> 01:40:33,152
We'll see

1882
01:40:33,664 --> 01:40:38,016
Who's our friend who's our friend

1883
01:40:38,272 --> 01:40:40,576
Jesus f****** Joe I'll give you 20 questions

1884
01:40:40,832 --> 01:40:41,856
I figure out who our friend is

1885
01:40:42,624 --> 01:40:43,392
Alright if you white

1886
01:40:43,648 --> 01:40:45,952

Former Republican Administration

1912
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:13,760
Not that I'm aware of

1913
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:16,832
I got nothing

1914
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:18,624
He's been on our show

1915
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:19,904
Exactly one

1916
01:42:21,952 --> 01:42:22,464
Termites

1917
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:30,656
The time

1918
01:42:34,752 --> 01:42:35,264
No

1919
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:36,032
Alright

1920
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:38,592

1922
01:42:39,616 --> 01:42:40,640
Just tell me don't try this out

1923
01:42:40,896 --> 01:42:44,736
To draw this out don't make me feel stupid

1924
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:51,904
Make a reference to that earlier in the show

1925
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:56,256
The international forecaster Bob Chapman's

1926
01:42:56,768 --> 01:43:02,656
Ciara guy who runs a publication called the international forecast

1927
01:43:02,912 --> 01:43:03,680
Prediction

1928
01:43:03,936 --> 01:43:05,216
It's about time.

1929
01:43:05,472 --> 01:43:09,824
Hey guess what we didn't realize from the times we listen to him

1930
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:13,664
He is just a f****** shill for gold sale

1931
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:16,992
I think the only true place

1932
01:43:18,272 --> 01:43:20,832
Is gold and silver related assets

1933
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:22,112
If you are

1934
01:43:22,368 --> 01:43:23,392
A wealthy person

1935
01:43:23,904 --> 01:43:24,416
And you want to have

1936
01:43:24,672 --> 01:43:25,696
20 of 30 of 40

1937
01:43:26,208 --> 01:43:27,488
Percent of your assets

1938
01:43:28,512 --> 01:43:29,536
In another state

1939
01:43:29,792 --> 01:43:31,584
Play server relatively safe place

1940
01:43:32,352 --> 01:43:34,400
I recommended Swiss franc Treasury

1941
01:43:34,912 --> 01:43:35,680
Other than that

1942
01:43:35,936 --> 01:43:36,448
I don't have any

1943
01:43:36,704 --> 01:43:37,472
Anything to offer

1944
01:43:37,984 --> 01:43:38,752
Okay so it's

1945
01:43:39,008 --> 01:43:41,056
Getting gold or silver ore

1946
01:43:41,312 --> 01:43:42,592
Swiss bank account

1947
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:44,640
Swiss bank account

1948
01:43:44,896 --> 01:43:47,200
That those are the safe places to put your money

1949
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:49,504
Thank you Bob

1950
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:50,272
Thanks Bob

1951
01:43:50,528 --> 01:43:51,040
Sounds right

1952
01:43:51,296 --> 01:43:55,136
So you're coming

1953
01:43:55,392 --> 01:43:56,160

1954
01:43:56,416 --> 01:43:59,488
Silver sale operation

1955
01:44:07,936 --> 01:44:13,568
For the government to actually

1956
01:44:13,824 --> 01:44:15,360
You screw with rich people

1957
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:18,176
The crimes for a long time

1958
01:44:23,296 --> 01:44:24,832
Only safe only safe place

Corporation office setup and f***

1962
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:48,640
You know you want to sell gold and silver

1963
01:44:49,408 --> 01:44:49,920
Bob's

1964
01:44:50,176 --> 01:44:50,688
Commendation for you

1965
01:44:51,968 --> 01:44:55,808
I pretty much is it even worth

1966
01:44:57,088 --> 01:44:57,856
Painting

1967
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:00,160
I know it's pretty

1968
01:45:00,416 --> 01:45:02,208
Stupid

1969
01:45:04,768 --> 01:45:06,560
We pretty much children worth

1970
01:45:07,072 --> 01:45:07,584
Like

1971
01:45:08,096 --> 01:45:10,144
Most of these bills and credit card dancing

1972
01:45:10,656 --> 01:45:13,216
Aldi store the things that the American people are going to be having

1973
01:45:13,472 --> 01:45:14,240
To deal with I mean if

1974
01:45:14,496 --> 01:45:15,264
If the money

1975
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:17,056
Nothing at all

1976
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:20,640
Even understand that

1977
01:45:20,896 --> 01:45:23,200
The people that you are the money to are still going to

1978
01:45:23,456 --> 01:45:23,968
To be within the

1979
01:45:24,224 --> 01:45:24,736
System

1980
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:27,040
There is going to be some kind of the system

1981
01:45:27,552 --> 01:45:28,832
Maybe it'll break down

1982
01:45:29,088 --> 01:45:29,600
From time to time

1983
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:32,416
And

1984
01:45:33,184 --> 01:45:33,952
Just because

1985
01:45:35,232 --> 01:45:37,280
The value of the dollar goes down

1986
01:45:37,792 --> 01:45:39,840
It still means you have to pay those bills

1987
01:45:40,608 --> 01:45:41,888
The way you protect yourself

1988
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:43,424
Is it called Midas

1989
01:45:43,936 --> 01:45:44,960
Enter just gold

1990
01:45:45,216 --> 01:45:45,728
Silver coin

1991
01:45:45,984 --> 01:45:47,520
Oh no

1992
01:45:47,776 --> 01:45:49,312
2 /

1993
01:45:49,568 --> 01:45:53,152
He was almost giving advice

1994
01:45:53,408 --> 01:45:57,760
Well he was really close to it because I wasn't

1995
01:45:58,016 --> 01:45:58,528
Just don't be an idiot

1996
01:46:05,184 --> 01:46:09,280
Disappear because of bad times

1997
01:46:09,536 --> 01:46:10,048
You sure

1998
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:17,984
The world is going to last another ten years but I don't want to get f***** over before then

1999
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:20,544
That's a reality check

2000
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:22,848
Like two people who are too far gone

2001
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:25,664
Did the other day

2002
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:27,712
Call Mike

2003
01:46:28,224 --> 01:46:28,736
Yeah that's not

2004
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:30,784
F****** over

2005
01:46:31,296 --> 01:46:32,320
That is too much

2006
01:46:33,344 --> 01:46:33,856
So

2007
01:46:34,624 --> 01:46:37,696
This interview goes on a little while

2008
01:46:41,536 --> 01:46:42,048
Speaker

2009
01:46:42,304 --> 01:46:43,328
F******

2010
01:46:43,584 --> 01:46:49,728
Confiscated like 16 burner phone from Michael Cohen

2011
01:46:49,984 --> 01:46:53,056
Type shyt right there like used in breaking

2012
01:46:53,312 --> 01:46:59,456
Bad whenever he opened the drawer with 16 burner phone

2013
01:46:59,712 --> 01:47:00,224
For the president

2014
01:47:02,272 --> 01:47:04,320
Find that hilarious

2015
01:47:05,088 --> 01:47:05,600
For me

2016
01:47:07,136 --> 01:47:07,904
Human

2017
01:47:08,416 --> 01:47:10,976
First human repo

2018
01:47:11,232 --> 01:47:13,536
Free phones

2019
01:47:14,816 --> 01:47:15,584
Why do you have sex

2020
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:16,864
3 phones

2021
01:47:18,656 --> 01:47:19,168
Is it your house

2022
01:47:19,936 --> 01:47:25,568

You know that that sort of thing

2024
01:47:27,616 --> 01:47:33,760
Just fight Channel

2025
01:47:34,016 --> 01:47:36,576
That's all I'm saying

2026
01:47:36,832 --> 01:47:38,112
I'll accept that is 14

2027
01:47:38,624 --> 01:47:42,208
Alright personal cell wireless cell

2028
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:44,000
You got three

2029
01:47:44,256 --> 01:47:48,608
That's it more than that you have

2030
01:47:48,864 --> 01:47:50,144
Mr. Arnaz

2031
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:51,936
You got some splainin to do

2032
01:47:53,984 --> 01:47:55,264

2033
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:59,616
Uncle 8404

2034
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:06,016
With the fourth being a wild-card that I can't explain but someone has a good explanation point

2035
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:08,576
Something like that

2036
01:48:09,344 --> 01:48:09,856
That's fun

2037
01:48:13,952 --> 01:48:15,232
4 make sense

2038
01:48:15,488 --> 01:48:16,512
You're crazy

2039
01:48:19,072 --> 01:48:24,448
It seems like more than enough circumstantial evidence for any jury to convict you of literally anything is like

2040
01:48:24,704 --> 01:48:30,848
This guy had 16 phone so like oh yeah he probably did some illegal ship it's one of those times

2041
01:48:33,664 --> 01:48:36,224
It's one of those times that I wish

2042
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:38,784
Like this argument would hold up in court

2043
01:48:39,296 --> 01:48:39,808
Come on

2044
01:48:42,112 --> 01:48:43,136
Come on

2045
01:48:45,184 --> 01:48:49,024

Come on come on

2047
01:48:52,608 --> 01:48:53,120

Your honor

2049
01:48:56,192 --> 01:48:56,960
Nothing

2050
01:48:57,216 --> 01:48:57,728
Your honor

2051
01:49:00,544 --> 01:49:03,104
Come on

2052
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:05,408
Text more calls

2053
01:49:06,688 --> 01:49:07,712
The Dixmoor calls

2054
01:49:07,968 --> 01:49:10,016
As much as we've enjoyed

2055
01:49:10,528 --> 01:49:11,552
Alex

2056
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:13,344
Being bad cops

2057
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:14,880
About how they killed an unarmed black man

2058
01:49:15,392 --> 01:49:17,696
We've enjoyed

2059
01:49:17,952 --> 01:49:19,744
Reasonability

2060
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:24,096
Might have more to do with hating cops

2061
01:49:24,352 --> 01:49:28,704
In 2009

2062
01:49:29,216 --> 01:49:29,728
TPAC bulshit

2063
01:49:29,984 --> 01:49:32,800
No I don't know I think it's just that I'm not

2064
01:49:33,056 --> 01:49:34,336
I'm not entirely sure that

2065
01:49:35,104 --> 01:49:36,128
I can't explain

2066
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:38,944
But I do know that it's not that he cares about black

2067
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:40,992
Listen to this

2068
01:49:48,928 --> 01:49:49,952
Culture

2069
01:49:50,464 --> 01:49:51,232
But I'm in there

2070
01:50:02,496 --> 01:50:04,288
You were right about Obama

2071
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:08,384
Betrayal

2072
01:50:08,896 --> 01:50:11,456
The people

2073
01:50:12,736 --> 01:50:15,808
They're just so arrogant and so trusting in the system

2074
01:50:19,648 --> 01:50:20,672
No no

2075
01:50:20,928 --> 01:50:21,952
It's perfect

2076
01:50:24,768 --> 01:50:25,536
Perfect

2077
01:50:26,048 --> 01:50:26,560
So

2078
01:50:28,352 --> 01:50:29,376
They're the reason that I

2079
01:50:29,632 --> 01:50:31,168
I think that that is racist

2080
01:50:31,424 --> 01:50:31,936
Austin character

2081
01:50:32,704 --> 01:50:34,752
Is because he says that he doesn't like

2082
01:50:35,264 --> 01:50:36,800
The culture of malls

2083
01:50:37,312 --> 01:50:39,360
And then immediately is like

2084
01:50:39,616 --> 01:50:44,480
Pocket bike

2085
01:50:44,736 --> 01:50:47,552
Did not get that

2086
01:50:47,808 --> 01:50:52,928
The fact that his mind went so quickly to apologetic black people coming up to him in the mall

2087
01:50:53,184 --> 01:50:56,768
After he said he didn't like the culture of them all

2088
01:50:57,024 --> 01:50:58,304
The culture of the mall thing

2089
01:50:58,560 --> 01:50:59,328
Did not bother me

2090
01:51:01,888 --> 01:51:02,912
Have nothing to do with Ray

2091
01:51:03,936 --> 01:51:06,496
I think I think the race issue comes up when he specifically

2092
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:08,800
Three black people

2093
01:51:09,056 --> 01:51:11,360
International style of

2094
01:51:11,616 --> 01:51:12,896
This is a made-up thing

2095
01:51:13,152 --> 01:51:16,224
Specifically point out minorities

2096
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:16,992
In order to

2097
01:51:17,248 --> 01:51:21,600
Bolster my credibility as though I have any but I also

2098
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:23,904
From context

2099
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:24,672
Clues

2100
01:51:25,184 --> 01:51:29,280
Even though we're so thrown by this man in 2009

2101
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:32,096
I still think I understand his brain

2102
01:51:32,352 --> 01:51:33,632
Pretty well

2103
01:51:34,144 --> 01:51:35,936
I don't like the

2104
01:51:36,192 --> 01:51:37,216
Culture of the mall

2105
01:51:37,728 --> 01:51:39,008
I think he's responding

2106
01:51:39,264 --> 01:51:41,056
Two black people being at the mall

2107
01:51:41,824 --> 01:51:42,848
I think that's what he said

2108
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:44,896
Because he's so quickly

2109
01:51:46,176 --> 01:51:47,456
Is he okay

2110
01:51:47,968 --> 01:51:48,736
If you listen to

2111
01:51:49,504 --> 01:51:50,272
He starts with

2112
01:51:50,528 --> 01:51:51,296
Here's the good

2113
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:53,856
I don't like the culture of the mall

2114
01:51:54,112 --> 01:51:56,416
But I was at the mall because I had to get a haircut

2115
01:51:56,928 --> 01:51:57,696
And black people came up

2116
01:51:57,952 --> 01:51:58,464
Give me an apology

2117
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,792
The track of that

2118
01:52:02,048 --> 01:52:03,072
Leave the person

2119
01:52:03,584 --> 01:52:04,608
A reasonable

2120
01:52:04,864 --> 01:52:05,888
Thinking person

2121
01:52:06,144 --> 01:52:06,912
To assume

2122
01:52:07,168 --> 01:52:08,960
That the culture he doesn't like in the mall

2123
01:52:09,216 --> 01:52:12,800
I've something to do with the black people go to college

2124
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:15,360
I can generally he

2125
01:52:15,616 --> 01:52:19,456
He doesn't like it when black people don't apologize to him at the mall when he's there

2126
01:52:19,712 --> 01:52:23,808
That's fair and good news at the last time

2127
01:52:27,904 --> 01:52:28,672
That I understand that

2128
01:52:29,184 --> 01:52:34,048
I'm going to be honest though my own personal my own personal biases

2129
01:52:34,304 --> 01:52:37,632
My own personal biases came out and I was like oh he doesn't like the huge

2130
01:52:38,144 --> 01:52:38,656
Right

2131
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:46,080
Mallrats in the 90s were all going to try and push it on my breakfast

2132
01:52:50,176 --> 01:52:50,944
Your haircut

2133
01:52:55,296 --> 01:52:56,832
There's Salon that down the

2134
01:52:58,112 --> 01:53:00,160
Come on

2135
01:53:00,416 --> 01:53:02,464
What are you talkin about

2136
01:53:04,512 --> 01:53:06,816
And also

2137
01:53:07,072 --> 01:53:11,168
Interview lady who cut Alex Jones hair

2138
01:53:14,752 --> 01:53:15,264
Probably took about

2139
01:53:16,288 --> 01:53:16,800
45-second

2140
01:53:18,848 --> 01:53:19,616
I have a whole lot of hair

2141
01:53:19,872 --> 01:53:21,152
Back then says the guy with

2142
01:53:23,456 --> 01:53:24,224
Hey hey

2143
01:53:24,736 --> 01:53:26,528
Don't talk about receding hairlines folks

2144
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:28,576
Love like having the Terrible

2145
01:53:29,344 --> 01:53:30,624
I don't like how much it cost

2146
01:53:31,648 --> 01:53:32,160
So I

2147
01:53:34,208 --> 01:53:38,048
My bill is going down as my hairline received

2148
01:53:38,304 --> 01:53:38,816
To tell you that right

2149
01:53:39,328 --> 01:53:39,840
Wow that's

2150
01:53:40,096 --> 01:53:40,608
The good news

2151
01:53:43,168 --> 01:53:44,192
No black people to come up

2152
01:53:44,448 --> 01:53:45,728
Tomato tell me about how

2153
01:53:45,984 --> 01:53:48,032

2154
01:53:48,288 --> 01:53:49,056

2155
01:53:51,104 --> 01:53:51,872
Panda eats

2156
01:53:52,128 --> 01:53:52,896

Bring home

2159
01:53:56,736 --> 01:53:58,784

2160
01:53:59,040 --> 01:53:59,552
What's up

2161
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:00,832
The other friend

2162
01:54:02,112 --> 01:54:02,880
Listen your quiet mom

2163
01:54:03,136 --> 01:54:05,184
Not naming this show

2164
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:06,464
0,

2165
01:54:07,232 --> 01:54:08,256
Because I think

2166
01:54:08,512 --> 01:54:10,304
More than talking about Alex Jones

2167
01:54:12,096 --> 01:54:12,864
Yeah

2168
01:54:15,168 --> 01:54:15,680
Is

2169
01:54:16,192 --> 01:54:19,520
All these other people who come up on his show all the people who are involved

2170
01:54:19,776 --> 01:54:20,800

01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:38,976
Running elaborate, right

2181
01:54:39,488 --> 01:54:40,768
I'm so

2182
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:43,072
Not naming our shows something that is

2183
01:54:43,328 --> 01:54:44,096
Even harder to

2184
01:54:44,352 --> 01:54:45,120
To find that are free

2185
01:54:45,888 --> 01:54:46,400
Yeah

2186
01:54:46,912 --> 01:54:50,240

01:55:20,192 --> 01:55:26,336
Cross-promotion right there

2191

2194
01:55:32,992 --> 01:55:35,552
Tell people to call Midas

2195
01:55:36,832 --> 01:55:40,416
Doing a quid-pro-quo in some way

2196
01:55:40,672 --> 01:55:42,464
For help with distribution

2197
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:47,840
And they're all doing it on the on this show in public

2198
01:55:48,864 --> 01:55:52,704
But Chad is doing

2199
01:55:56,800 --> 01:55:58,336
Ears

2200
01:56:00,128 --> 01:56:04,736
I guess $90 under what it is right now

I-88 probably going to say it's a good deal but I don't know what is

2204
01:56:27,264 --> 01:56:27,776
Going to say about it

2205
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:32,384
I predict Bob Chapman's going to be suspicious

2206
01:56:32,896 --> 01:56:35,200
What would you give for Ted to go on and be like

2207
01:56:35,968 --> 01:56:36,736

Way higher than what it was

2215
01:56:57,216 --> 01:56:58,496
What I did is I pick

2216
01:56:58,752 --> 01:57:00,800

You know if your whole thing I mean that gun issue that you're talking about earlier

2229
01:57:36,384 --> 01:57:37,920
So even Ted Anderson

2230
01:57:38,432 --> 01:57:38,944
Answer

2231
01:57:40,992 --> 01:57:42,016

About how everyone's going to get their guns

01:58:24,768 --> 01:58:30,912
You better bury your guns and ammunition if he's read the book

Might be even further Synergy The Runaway of it Bob Chapman owns where to hide your guns.com

2248
01:58:41,152 --> 01:58:41,664

2251
01:58:45,504 --> 01:58:46,784
Anyway

2252
01:58:47,296 --> 01:58:49,088

Free days in January 2009

2255
01:58:52,416 --> 01:58:54,208
Here's what I think of the important takeaway

2256
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:55,232
1

2257
01:58:55,744 --> 01:58:56,768
Alex is already

2258
01:58:57,280 --> 01:58:57,792

Nicole

01:59:36,704 --> 01:59:37,728
Maybe

2273
01:59:37,984 --> 01:59:38,752
I don't know

2274
01:59:39,008 --> 01:59:39,520
We might

2275
01:59:39,776 --> 01:59:41,312
See that in the next episode

2276
01:59:41,568 --> 01:59:43,616
You who knows who knows

2277
01:59:43,872 --> 01:59:44,896
Who knows

2278
01:59:45,152 --> 01:59:46,944
You do I don't actually know all that much

2279
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:48,992
Actually Alex goes on vacation

2280
01:59:58,208 --> 02:00:02,048
Alright

2281
02:00:02,304 --> 02:00:03,840
Alakazam

2282
02:00:04,096 --> 02:00:08,704
Alexander vacation they are supposed to do that guy has

2283
02:00:09,216 --> 02:00:10,752
I know I do like

2284
02:00:11,008 --> 02:00:13,056
The character from

2285
02:00:16,896 --> 02:00:17,664
Use come out since

2286
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:18,688
Secret inside the tower

2287
02:00:19,712 --> 02:00:21,504
I guess because most of

2288
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:22,784
His old employees have

2289
02:00:25,088 --> 02:00:27,392
The other thing I think is important is that Alex

2290
02:00:27,648 --> 02:00:29,440
Is a racist

2291
02:00:29,696 --> 02:00:30,208
Yeah.

2292
02:00:32,512 --> 02:00:33,280
Which is interesting

2293
02:00:33,792 --> 02:00:35,072
Also

2294
02:00:35,328 --> 02:00:39,680
He's willing to talk negatively about his room if he's one of those reflexive race

2295
02:00:40,192 --> 02:00:40,704
At this point

2296
02:00:41,472 --> 02:00:42,752
Where it it normal

2297
02:00:43,008 --> 02:00:49,152
It's almost out and out

2298
02:00:51,200 --> 02:00:51,968
In which is what he is now

2299
02:00:52,224 --> 02:00:53,760
It's more like it's just

2300
02:00:54,016 --> 02:00:56,576

To have an interview with a guy who is there for First Peoples right you know witches

2304
02:01:13,984 --> 02:01:14,752
Pretty crazy

2305
02:01:15,008 --> 02:01:16,544

2306
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:17,568

2307
02:01:17,824 --> 02:01:18,848

02:01:20,640 --> 02:01:21,152
