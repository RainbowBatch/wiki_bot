2017

76
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,344
That's why John Wick 2 name is not true

77
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,392

Honestly I'm very self-conscious about this

84
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,703
Yeah I know so far

85
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,471
It's crazy

86
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:28,031
I feel like I have low energy

87
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:34,431
You know I feel like I need a good job thinking those people

88
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:40,319
Various

89
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:43,903
You know what today

00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,231
I'm not in it

92
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,327
I tried

93
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:55,935

94
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,983
54 like the show today

95
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,335
Can't do it I just

96
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:05,151
I'm not interested in it I really tried to force it

97
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,711
It's one of the challenges of doing a show like this

98
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:10,015
Does like sometimes it's not fun

99
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:13,599
Studying portion especially is not

100
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,623

104
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:24,863
The fun episode for us to do today

105
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:31,263
Flu Game is that you're under the weather and you're still going to f****** deliver is that what's going on

106
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,823
We'll see how that turns out.

107
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,359
Talk to me after the show

108
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:38,175
I really I really

109
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,223
My heart and soul wasn't in this

110
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,783
But I think it's going to work out okay

111
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:43,807
But

112
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,087
My heart and soul

113
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:47,903
Dammit

114

Because I kind of

118
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,223
A little bit

119
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:16,063

Hamamoto

124
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,703
How I was

125
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:37,823

129
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:50,879
This year

130
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,927
When Alex Jones was out

131
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:56,255
Some of the people celebrating at the inauguration

132
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,791

The b*******

139
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,583
I got to pray.

Yes infowars.com is Grace

141
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:39,007
I think the selection committee probably put that in the four-seat over some of his lengthy

142
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,031
What's about the devil

143
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,079
Because of the fake tears

144
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,103
The fake beers

145
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:49,503
I'm a guy yelling bulshit

146
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,271

00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,367
The number one

149
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,927
From our first episode ever

150
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,719
It might be time

151
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:06,399
Red Alert

152
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,935
This is getting crazy

153
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,847
This is so freaking out of control

154
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,175
It's time to pray

155
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:24,319

156
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,391
Pray

157
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:31,743

Red Alert

161
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:41,215
The Rhythm on that if you recall the reason that he was going into that you know thinking that it's time to

162
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:46,079
Despres was because he thought the Benjamin Netanyahu was going to get arrested immediately

163
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,199
Hey why I think the

164
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,247
Unfortunately this might be another one that's

165
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,015
The upside

166
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:54,783
Don't be very difficult

167
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:02,719
Any kind of first episode

168
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:06,559
Battle for the b******* Gallery at the rally

Go home

171
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:17,055
I'm leaning towards that as the favorite for the Holt

172
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:20,127
It's going to be tough for something else to come in

173
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,663
Although I have

174
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,943
Some surprises

175
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:29,343
I have something you might have forgotten absurd

176
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,903
Speaking of horses

177
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,439
God dammit

178
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:37,279
But you said you weren't

179
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,095
Just muscle memory

180
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,399
I can do that asleep

181
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,191
Jordan

182
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:49,567
Like I said I didn't care for his show today I found it very boring and didn't want to play

183
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,871
Games with it and I was trying to

184
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,639
Think about like

185
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,175
Maybe today

186
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:57,759
We go back and we go to 2008

187
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,527
Birthday

188
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,343
Way too much time I didn't have the time to do it

189
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:04,159
And I don't want to half-ass but I don't want to half-ass anything

190
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,279
And that is

191
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:14,655
The David Charlie Sheen destroyed his own life on Alex's show

192
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:18,751
Do you not remember this

193
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:23,103
I remember I remember him destroying his life I didn't remember that it was on Alex's

194
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,407
Let me give you a little bit of History

195
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,431
So

196
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,455
At the time

197
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,247
In 2011

198
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:33,855
Charlie Sheen was making 1.8 million dollars per episode on Two and a Half Men

199
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,135
And what would be his last

200
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,159
Season of the show

201
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,207
Also

202
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,999
He had to

203
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,559
Little bit of backstory on him

204
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:46,655
Had a stroke after overdosing on cocaine

205
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:50,495
January 1990 she and accidentally shot his fiance in the arm

206
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,311
Accidentally shot hernia Google

207
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:56,639
Let's just called the Burrows special

208
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:59,711
Misdemeanor assault charges involving his wife

209
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,527
Brooke Mueller in August 2010 receiving the sentence

210
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,367
Anger management counseling

211
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,159
His second wife Denise Richards

212
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,719
Accuse him of physically and verbally abusing her threat

213
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,023
Shooting a restraining order against

214
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,047
2006

215
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:20,447
On October 26th 2010 Charlie Sheen was removed from the Plaza hotel after doing over 7,000

216
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,215
Dollars in damage

217
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:21,983
Just did a property

218
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,799
According to the New York New York Police Department

219
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,871
Charlie Sheen came that night

220
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:31,967
I was going to say I thought you were going to say he did over $7,000 of Coke

221
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:36,319
Warriors 2011

222
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,087
When production

223
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,623
Was forced into hiatus

224
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:43,999
Because Charlie had to go to rehab after he was hospitalized following a Coke binge

225
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,023
The third time

226
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,559
He tried to get clean in the past

227
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,887
Then on February 18th 2011

228
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,191
Charlie Sheen went on the Alex Jones Show

229
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,983
Then acted like a drugged-up idiot

230
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,031
Which is literally the reason he ended up

231
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,311
Getting fired from his show

232
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,079
Wow

233
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,359
All of that stuff

234
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,407
Charlie Sheen public meltdown

235
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,735
All of it started on Alex Jones

236
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:08,063
We're going to listen to you cuz I was like

237
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:17,023
Interesting Lee klusterfuk

238
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,327
In like later because Alex

239
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,631
Is the beginning of this dark

240
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:25,215
Alex goes on The View today

241
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:29,055
What might be where you getting for Barbara Walters connection

242
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:30,847
Yeah

243
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:37,247
Start screaming allowed Alex pretty wild

244
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:41,599
Cuz he keeps trying to say electronic drugs

245
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,391
Amanda

246
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,159
It just turn

247
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,719
Turns into people yelling over each other he wants

248
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,743
To talk about the bank

249
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,767
What have you

250
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,791
And Whoopi is like

251
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:53,631
Can we please talk about Charlie Sheen

252
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,751
I'm like everybody remembers the

253
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:03,103
The Tiger Blood everybody remembers a lot a lot of these quote

254
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:09,503
What they forget is a lot of them started on Alex Jones Show

255
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,831
That was proven true

256
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,111
The black nobility

257
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,183
So this is a fateful day

258
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,487
That it's interesting that history is Rewritten

259
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:24,863
Because the public meltdown went so much further

260
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,655
His appearance

261
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,679
On Alex Jones

262
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,447
On the show

263
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,727
Kick-started a lot of

264
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:31,775
Forgot

265
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,311
In the General Public

266
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,991
We are not ones to forget

267
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,783
There's not a lot to do bunk here

268
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,319
There's ripped

269
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:50,975
Really just we're going to end up listening to Charlie Sheen act like an idiot and Alex Jones last cuz he know that this is going to get him so much

270
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:54,559
Get me on The View

271
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,143
Houston says type higher than that but whatever

272
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,263
Spoiler alert

273
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,799
I thought it was just

274
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,895
It's a lady Dykstra

275
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,711
Everybody knew who Nails was I know that's

276
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:18,367
I know that the two of them were talking about specifically Lenny Dykstra

277
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,391
The only person

278
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:25,535
He shows up at the end of the interview

279
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,375
Dykstra shows up

280
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,471
We don't

281
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:39,103
Wait did you just have a dizzy just know when people are speaking about him in the aethersphere

282
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,919
They're all friends

283
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:45,503
Listen to any of that because

284
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:50,623
It just the reality of Alex Jones talking to Charlie Sheen and Lenny Dykstra

285
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:55,231
Is overshadowed by how boring it is it's really nothing is

286
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:58,047
Disappointed

287
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,071
He wants to be

288
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:03,167
Daddy I want

289
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:05,215
Tell Charlie Sheen on a fake

290
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:05,983
Property

291
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,543
That's the goal I have there

292
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,591
Extra

293
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,383
Guy awesome

294
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,967
Which I would argue with both him and Alex being bad friends

295
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,991
Anyway

296
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,087
Is a variable

297
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:27,999
What's going on

298
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:37,727
Absolute home

299
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,871
Here's your first pee test next one goes in your mouth now you won't get high

300
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:47,199
All good

301
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:57,695
Well yeah but there's only one time in the gym if you

302
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:09,471
The clipse not done but

303
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,495
Throughout

304
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:14,591
This time and whenever Alex goes on The View

305
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,407
They're referencing also after this

306
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,943
Charlie Sheen

307
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,991
Cameras into his house

308
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,271
And they publicly took

309
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:25,599
His blood to be tested

310
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,415
It's kind of interesting because blood test

311
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,439
For drug use

312
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,207
Is

313
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,487
Credibly

314
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,767
Credibly Acura

315
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,815
Mega Gallade it's very good

316
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:35,839
Good for finding stuff

317
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,607
But

318
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,447
Detectable in your blood the window is

319
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,471
Very short

320
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,495
So for instance

321
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,055
Amphetamines aren't detectable after like

322
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,335
Hours

323
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,943
24-hours barbiturates

324
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,247
Possibly about a day or two

325
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,319
Could be

326
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,087
Quick is

327
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:01,439
6 hours later is out of your blood cocaine generally about 12 hours

328
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,975
Detectable in your blood

329
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:03,999
So

330
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:07,071
I don't know I'm not convinced

331
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,375
0

332
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,679
PCP about 12 hours

333
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,447
Is generally speak

334
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,519
PID

335
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,567
Proving that he's not doing drugs

336
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,127
Give blood is like

337
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:24,735
That's that's ridiculous

338
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,551
Committed to that

339
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:31,903
Thumbs up together

340
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,951
Meltdown just call

341
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:38,047
Me neither

342
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,071
Somebody who is

343
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:39,839
Clearly

344
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,375
Mentally ill on

345
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,143
Tapas

346
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,935
Doing all that like now

347
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:44,703
You're not

348
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:51,103
You don't wind up doing a s*** ton of cocaine and and all of the s*** without having some underlying

349
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:51,871
Mental issue

350
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,151
She's going on

351
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:53,919
Clear that

352
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:58,015
Use if not of my people at least

353
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,039
Do the bipolar

354
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:01,599
It was like

355
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,135
A little bit of

356
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:09,279
You stop punching up whatever you're mocking

357
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,047
Celebrity

358
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,327
Restart real

359
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:16,447
Does the celebrity person gets eclipse

360
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:18,495
Spivey human portion of it and it's

361
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:23,103
Right yeah that whole time. Is very uncomfortable for me cuz I didn't know if

362
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:26,943
Painful

363
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,735
This is business really tough to watch

364
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,527
I think my biggest issue.

365
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,087
Alex went to Charlie's house

366
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:37,183
Hi everybody in French for long time

367
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,743
I don't know

368
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,471
All the time he does sometimes

369
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:52,287
Essenza playing out

370
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,311
He doesn't want to bring it up

371
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,871
Especially

372
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:56,895
I don't want to tease

373
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,711
Too much but the stuff that Charlie Sheen has said

374
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:03,039
Lately about this period of his life

375
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,343
I don't think Alex wants to associate men

376
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,391
Okay

377
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,439
Because Charlie Sheen's retconned whole bunches

378
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,719
Okay let's say

379
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:16,607
Spoiler alert the steroid cream

380
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:21,215

00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:53,471

405
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:39,295
Disrespected

406
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,111
Preppers

Goddess

413
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:56,447
That is simply another way to meeting with

414
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,031
Sing for him to like

415
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:05,151
Terrestrial words aren't enough

416
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,711
F*** you

00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,015
Talkin about the pornstars

418
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:13,343
He's hanging out with

419
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,416
Hey I don't judge

420
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:20,000
No neither do I but it's just have to look at the pic

421
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:22,816
Picture of what he was doing at that time

422
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:23,840
Gazelle

423
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,632
Actually we'll even get to

424
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,168
Talk about like weather

425
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,728
I believe then wife

426
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,032
Is involved with

427
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:32,800
Shenanigans

428
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:33,824
And you're very

429
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,592
Spin on it

430
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:49,952
Is that where they were for

431
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,072
You're going to need it

432
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:06,080
And and and and we are and I don't know anyone

433
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:16,064
What will Charlie have known you for

434
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:18,368
664 South

435
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:29,376
You are now

436
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:43,456
I was really really flattered that he got it right that I'm not getting he might be nails but I'm freaking

437
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:53,440
Winning

438
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:56,000
Every second

439
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:11,104
Underwear before my first cup of coffee because

440
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:21,088
Ugly wives and children and just look at their loser lives and then they'll give me

441
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:29,024
That does sound a lot like Alex Jones

442
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:32,096
Add to some extent

443
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:38,752
Concentrated version of the ship that Alex Jones is spread out over overtime

444
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,032
Cuz I bet

445
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:40,800
Wanted to

446
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,080
You could go back

447
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:44,896
Can find a little chunk of different sentence

448
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,432
Then put all of those trucks

449
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,712
Together and it would be worth

450
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:48,992
Yeah

451
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,784
Alex is that same

452
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,064
Also I'm

453
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,600
Interested now because

454
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,136
Alex Jones

455
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:55,904
100

456
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,208
Percent of coke with Charlie

457
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:01,024
But there's a decent I don't know if we can

458
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:01,792
I don't know if

459
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,072
100

460
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:07,680
Very high

461
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,728
And I

462
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:11,776
Code for

463
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,056
Yeah we did a lot of Coke

464
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:16,384
I can't refute that I don't know I think it's

465
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,176
Will ever be able to prove

466
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,968
Entirely possible whatever

467
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:23,808
The issue here is that like this is irresponsible

468
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,856
Like

469
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:26,624
You suck

470
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:34,816
Attention grabber you such as you so desperate for any kind of attention that'll come to him

471
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:37,376
But he knows that like

472
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:40,704
Everyone's going to be recognizing the damage

473
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,496
Probably come to

474
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,776
The reputation in the life

475
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,824
Someone he considers a friend

476
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:53,248
That's bad that's not a good human thing to do like if you came in here one day you were all f***** up

477
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,272
And you started

478
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,064
Talking nonsense

479
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:58,624
You'll see some of the other shity end up saying

480
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,392
Lake

481
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:02,720
I would not put that out or I would tell you to

482
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:06,560
Just shut up and try and get the interview on track

483
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:07,584
George Webb

484
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:08,608
Substance

485
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,376
What's the matter is

486
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,680
Do that

487
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:14,496
Using

488
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:16,288
He's using Turnpike

489
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:20,896
Cruel thing to

490
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,992
That's one of the reasons I wanted to go over there

491
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,832
I mean not as much as it is interesting

492
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:31,392
A lot of that madness has its roots

493
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,672
Herein

494
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,696
Alex's show

495
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:37,536
These sort of Cruelty of Alex's allowing

496
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,560
Him to do that

497
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:41,120
Is

498
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:44,704
That's why I hate

499
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,240
Giving you positive feedback

500
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,288
Bringing the goods

501
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:54,176
Get to where things were fairly problematic

502
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,712
It is one of the big reason

503
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:05,440
Exit strategy

504
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:12,352
Children in the world

505
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:23,872
Effortlessly and magically appear gold

506
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:30,272
His job which is to write

507
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:32,320
Above-the-law

508
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:34,112
Dude

509
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,672
He's talking about Chuck Lorre

510
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,720
Got a little

511
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:41,792
Little bit

512
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:44,608
Quizlet calling him Haim Levine

513
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:47,168
Because his real name is Charles Michael Levine

514
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,240
Geheim part is

515
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:51,776
Probably just

516
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,568
Directly

517
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,872
You are a true

518
00:26:56,384 --> 00:27:00,992
I embarrassed him and his Jew children in front of the world like

519
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:05,600
Chuck Lorre

520
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:10,464
Changed his name because his mother was never a fan of his father's family

521
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,840
When displeased with Mason Rudolph

522
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,912
You know what you are you're Lovin

523
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,448
A no-good rotten Levine

524
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,032
As far back as I can remember every time I heard my last name mote experience

525
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,312
Acute feelings of low self

526
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,152
Is that

527
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:30,944
Songs of take

528
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,480
Toll on me

529
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:36,320
Mysteries not trying to hide

530
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:40,160
Is Jewish Heritage or whatever you know like it's not it's not

531
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:42,976
And the fact that you know Charlie is

532
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,768
Is that using that is

533
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:45,792
Some sort of an insult

534
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:46,816
Is really the reason

535
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,352
But he got into trouble

536
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,912
From Guardian article here

537
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,472
Filming of the 30-minute show two and a half

538
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,824

540
00:27:59,104 --> 00:27:59,872
Until he hit the self

541
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:00,640
Destruct button

542

Spectacular Style on Thursday

543
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:05,248
We spoke to a radio jock

544
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,272
Call Alex Jones

545
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,808
Her CBS

546
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,856
Holding company Warner Bros television

547
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,136
Probably most stuck

548
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,928
McCraw was it

549
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,208
Tirade

550
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:17,280
Against the Creator and Lead writer of Two and a Half Men Chuck Lorre

551
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,072
That's probably

552
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:23,424
You know the world believes

553
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,192
That was bigger

554
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:27,776
That that's real bad and probably a big part of why he

555
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:30,848
What are more innocent

556
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,128
Radio jock

557
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:34,944

Big catch phrases

563
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:58,496
Get deployed

564
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:01,824
Just Luna

565
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:08,224
Yeah

566
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,440
People pushing around

567
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:21,280
Understatement

568
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:26,400
I just I'm sorry man I got my fingertips

569
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:30,240
Most of the time in this is snaps

570
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:32,544
F-18 bro

571
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:37,152
Are you in the air and I will I will I will deploy my ordinances to the ground

00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,464

598
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,536

Major League back to the minors came out in 1998

614
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,096
I mean I'm splitting

615
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:10,144
Here's a little bit cuz they're already in the third film

616
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,728
A proper sequel

617
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:15,264
Since that one did so poorly

618
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,288
Really bad

619
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:19,360
It's just a

620
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:23,456
It was really weird in Back to the minors whenever the

621
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,992
Disgraced nuclear physicist

622
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:27,040
Was murdered trying to buy

623
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:29,088
Is that a different movie

624
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:31,392
NASCAR does get thrown

625
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:34,208
Anyway

626
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,000
Alex

627
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:37,536
Charlie Sheen the

628
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,584
$64,000 Question

629
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,120
Which is why

630
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:43,424
Did you decide to come and do this on Infowars

631
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,192
A really big class

632
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:48,032
He does my answer would be

633
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,080
Yeah I figure the stakes are low

634
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,944
If you're going to do something like this

635
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,712
It's a

636
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:59,552
Bet that most people aren't going to pay attention to Alex

637
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,856
But you forget that your own celebrity in

638
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:05,184
Is Charlie Sheen's on Celebrity

639
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,256
Which would be down here

640
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,536
To another level

641
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:13,632
Have you are going to pay attention to it if they were live

642
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:17,728
To my mind what I hear there is

643
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:18,752
Alex

644
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:19,520
Who's calling me

645
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:22,336
Alex told me that I should call him

646
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:24,640
He-Man

647
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,920
Interviewing

648
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,456

00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:32,320
His perceptions were they was not a show

650
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,088

Then

655
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:52,544
Truth

656
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:53,824

00:34:55,360 --> 00:35:00,992
Run Charlie Sheen's career almost single-handedly Charlie Sheen did it to himself but Alex

00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:03,808
Has a role to play and if I

660
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,600
Any professional would absolutely

661
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:10,720
And then we get another one of those

662
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,768

666
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:25,056
You can leave a warning

667
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:28,384
They should not dumb I'm just not

668
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,688
Target

669
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,968
It's over

670
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:34,016
There's a new sheriff in town

Darlene Arlington in my life

680
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,440

People

682
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:25,216
Context of this episode

683
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:26,752
I know that

684
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:29,312
A lot of people made a lot of hay out of the Vatican

685
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:33,408
Assassin's game ends at like maybe he actually thought the back in the past

686
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,432
Sims were after him

687
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,968
And what have you

688
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,504
I don't know what that's like

689
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,088
I kind of lean towards what you're saying

690
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:47,488
Text I'm able to glean from this episode

691
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,768
And I'm decided to talk

692
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:49,792
About on air

693
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:52,352

694
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,120
Trolling

695
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:55,936
Thought about

696
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:59,520
While they were all doing a lot of coke together and Trust shootouts

697
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:00,544
Entirely possible

698
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,336
Do you know when you do Coke

699
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:03,872
You don't end up just doing nothing

700
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:04,896
Sometimes you watch a movie

701
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,944
Or hang out with Lenny Dykstra

702
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:10,784
Anytime anybody does coke Lenny Dykstra

703
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,624
Shows up

Weird breakdown of Apocalypse Now

706
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,984

723
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:51,392

Apocalypse

730
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:19,040
I don't think that was Joseph Campbell

731
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:24,416
But I don't I don't think so I don't think it was a

732
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:26,208
I don't think it was like

733
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:32,864
Everyone's trying to destroy your family except your family

734
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,704

Martin Sheen

740
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:49,760
I wonder how Charlie's doing

741
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:51,040
Do you think he's doing okay

742
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:54,880
Sort of

743
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:57,440

00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,112
And your son

763
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:02,976
Exploded his career in everything about his life

764
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:05,024
Yeah how do you react to that

765
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,096
Like I know they don't have a particularly close relationship

766
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:11,424
I would assume

767
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,496
I don't know because also you have to consider Tuesday

768
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:15,776
You know

769
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:18,592
As we'd certainly doubt it very rough

770
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:20,896
Details you know certainly not a full picture

771
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:22,944
Charlie Sheen have a history of

772
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,480
Domestic violence dating back

773
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:30,368
89 or whatever and he's been in and out of rehab center around that time

774
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,672
So like as a parent you

775
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:33,952
Kind of probably

776
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:36,768
It diminished expectations

777
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:38,048
Perhaps Perhaps

778
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:40,352
You kind of have to for your own protection

779
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:42,912
Right like understand that there's just

780
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:44,960
It's just a reality gear

781
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:49,312
There's there's nothing worse than what a parent

782
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:50,080
Has to bury their

783
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:51,616
Let's

784
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:57,503
Number of people in the world who has the heads up

785
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:58,527
Abuse issues in a

786
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:00,063
Have been able to turn their life around

787
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,343
Through the help of the program

788
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,623
Right there number

789
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:04,415
People who advocate for Alta

790
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:07,743
Ternative program certainly there's you know a a is

791
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:09,535
Isn't the only way to go or an A

792
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:11,327
There are other non

793
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:12,351
Space Bass

794
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:17,215
Sort of organization

795
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:18,751
Innovation bubble that criticism

796
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:20,543
Thrown around a lot

797
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:21,823
Of the higher power

798
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:22,591
Component

799
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:23,615
Switch lot of people

800
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,383
Misrepresent

801
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:25,663
Understand to me and that you have

802
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:29,247
But

803
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,295
Frozen does not like

804
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:40,255
Charlie

805
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:49,983
Charlie Sheen

806
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:06,367
Cleanse myself I close my eyes

807
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:11,231
Ridiculous

808
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:33,759
Simple syrup

809
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:39,647
Chapter Book of Lies

810
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,463
Necessarily a drug of abuse

811
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:44,255
You know in the same way that alcoholic

812
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:47,071
Is it not really

813
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:49,887
You can't really do it all the time

814
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:51,679
It's really hard to do all the

815
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:53,983
Most people will never have to even

816
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:56,031
Color come close

817
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:58,079
To the idea of being addicted

818
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:59,359
New lsv

819
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:01,919
But be that as it may

820
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:02,687
The point that

821
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:04,991
Has

822
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:07,551
Have you heard of anybody who was a dick

823
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:14,207
It's something with like mushrooms

824
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:17,791
If you can't do too much of it your body that won't allow yeah

825
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:19,071
I have you do a bunch

826
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:19,839
Chevelle.

827
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:20,863
Having as much of

828
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,167
Given the fact you'll just naturally look

829
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:25,983
GameStop

830
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:30,591
Chemicals I don't understand

831
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:32,639
Tattoos psychedelic

832
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:37,759
You can absolutely do to it

833
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:40,831
You do too much

834
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,487
Some sort of a

835
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:50,559
Jeff Foxworthy's setup

836
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,655
If you go to manager

837
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:56,703
You might do too much ass

838
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:00,031
It's not good

839
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,055
Nope

840
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,847
I just did a bad thing

841
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:05,663
So I would I would

842
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:06,687
Suggest that

843
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:08,991
His rhetoric about AAA is

844
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:11,551
I would suggest

845
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:12,831
That based on

846
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:14,879
Everything

847
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:16,159
You did not

848
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:19,487
Cure himself of addiction Indiana

849
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:24,351
Kind of thinking

850
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:25,887
Time

851
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:32,031
Multiple times

852
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:34,591
The failed attempts at rehab

853
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:36,895
You

854
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,943
Here's the thing that's why that 54

855
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:40,479
Unsuccessful

856
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:43,039
Siding for AAA does have

857
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:44,319
Pretty low

858
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:48,671
Success rate as a whole people who decide

859
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:50,207
Quit on their own

860
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:50,975
That success rate

861
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:52,255
Subway

862
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:53,791
Addiction does

863
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:55,839
Require a lot of

864
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:57,375
Personal

865
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:58,143
Will

866
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:02,495
You can tell whether or not you have a program

867
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:04,799
And there's a couple pieces

868
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:06,591
That are born that everyone

869
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,127
Go through recovery nose

870
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:08,895
That relapse

871
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:09,663
Does a part of recovery

872
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:11,199
And you're going to end

873
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,991
End up failing

874
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:14,271
I'm just getting back on track

875
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:16,319
I meant Beyonce

876
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:17,599
It's anonymous

877
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:21,439
And I don't know if you're able to really get a good

878
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,463
Statistical

879
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:25,023
A perfectly accurate portrait

880
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:27,327
That's a good point

881
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:29,887
I think the success rate is lower than we would hope

882
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:32,703
Bye

883
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:34,751
Leaving people it within their own

884
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:35,519
Addiction

885
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:36,799
That usually leave

886
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:38,335
For prison

887
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,359
Yeah so

888
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:40,639
I'll take it by force

889
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:42,175
Success rate if that's what it is

890
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:45,247
Better than zero

891
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:46,527
Things like a game

892
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:49,599
And stuff like that I don't know I don't know enough about

893
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:51,135
I've heard some people

894
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:53,183
Suggesting that it's a very powerful

895
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:55,231
Cure for addiction

896
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:55,999
Sounds

897
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:58,559
Like a very heavy hallucinate

898
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:00,351
Oh okay

899
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:02,655
You hear people talking about how like you're going

900
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:04,191
Doing ayahuasca

901
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:08,031
Cured the most

902
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:09,055
I think it's possible

903
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:13,407
Servant

904
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:14,175
McLean vet

905
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:15,199
Taking

906
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:16,479
LSD is

907
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,271
Way of

908
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:19,551
Kind of

909
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,087
Lessening your symptoms of

910
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:25,183
Read a lot about

911
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:26,463
A lot of

912
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:27,743
Philip said that they

913
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:29,279
Haven't had to deal with that is

914
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:31,327
Stringent AAA

915
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:32,863
Or even like

916
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:33,887
To be helping with

917
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:37,215
PTSD

918
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:38,495
I know it's outside of

919
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:39,775
Mystery like

920
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:47,455
Madison-kipp possibility

921
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:51,039
But there is a there's a world of recovery outside of AA

922
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:53,343
I'd rather him espoused

923
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,647
Supposed to

924
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:58,207
These stupid assholes I cured myself in a nanosec

925
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:01,791
Yeah the guy who ran the organization

926
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:02,559
And was I

927
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:07,935
But the thing that I

928
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:08,959
Think about

929
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:09,983
Listening

930
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:11,519
Into this kind of chocolate

931
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:12,543
Clearly he's

932
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:13,823
He's

933
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,639
At the veterinary least having a manic episode

934
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:17,919
Throughout

935
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:18,943
This hole.

936
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:20,223
Perhaps

937
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:22,527
Look at that

938
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,575
What it is the

939
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:25,343
Sycophantic

940
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,623
Do to those kind

941
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:28,671
The form of

942
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:31,231
Yeah

943
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:34,815
I'm not just Alex but all of the people around him at that

944
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:37,375
Nails

945
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:40,447
Giving him that kind of

946
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:45,055
Ego and narcissism

947
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:46,079
And allowing that

948
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:47,615
Spread

949
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:48,639
Allowing

950
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:49,919
To be as far as

951
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:53,503
If you are

952
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:54,271
Charlie Sheen

953
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:56,063
You have a mass

954
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:56,831
The platform

955
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:58,367
To say something

956
00:48:59,391 --> 00:48:59,903
Positive

957
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:02,719
Because you're surrounded by these

958
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:04,511
To tell you that everything you say is

959
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,327
That is a pause

960
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:10,911
What you saying is I am opening people's eyes

961
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:12,447
In the same way that

962
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,983
Jones is surrounded by those

963
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:16,543
Sycophants who just

964
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:22,943
Everything you do is the greatest possible person

965
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:25,247
All of the negative s*** that you are putting

966
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:26,015
Is

967
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:32,159
Is viewed by you as something that you're doing to help jump bigger

968
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:36,767
It's like all this

969
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:37,535
Tough love

970
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:40,863
Need to break you free of this concept of

971
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:41,887
Being a better

972
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:48,287
Carson Daly

973
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:50,847
AAA is trying to

974
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:51,615
Charlie Sheen

975
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:53,151
I think he probably thinks that

976
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:56,735
So you know Alex Jones fancies himself a

977
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:58,783
Classical liberal Alexa Collins

978
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:03,135
The classical liberal in the Thomas

979
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:04,671
Jefferson Mall

980
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:07,999
It is something really weird about Thomas Jefferson

981
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:09,791
Be one of us

982
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:13,375
Flashlight

983
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:19,007
Thomas Jefferson

984
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:27,711
Alright

985
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:32,319
Alright I would have thought I expect you to be like

986
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,087
Alright

987
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:39,487
Now we're going to get into all of the fight that Thomas Jefferson was over the years I would expect Alex to be like

988
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:43,583
You're now inviting

989
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:44,351
Important founding

990
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:46,655
Father-in-law

991
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:48,959
He has this is one of those

992
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:52,031
Alex has no actual Prince

993
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:56,127
If I want you to like me

994
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:57,407
I will a

995
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:58,431
Agree with every

996
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:05,087
Any heavy lifting at all or trying to leave the conversation into greener pastures

997
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:05,855
He's just like

998
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:07,903
Doing is fake laugh

999
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:08,671
Sincere laugh

1000
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:15,071
Batman just being like anyone

1001
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:17,631
Allowing him to play himself out

1002
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:20,703
Charlie spray bullets everywhere

1003
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:23,263
It allows them to do this

1004
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:26,335
To read a note from one of his goddesses

1005
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:28,895
Who's on the air is about nothing

1006
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:29,663
Listen

1007
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:33,503
Iran air

1008
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:45,535
And it just says I'm blessed and perfect my insane life is

1009
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:51,935
My monkey man like seeing my high priest ninja warlock I love you violently with the fire of 1000

1010
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:57,823
Experienced Jedi Mind Powers amazing humor and unconditional love

1011
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:59,359
I am truly honored

1012
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:01,663
View

1013
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:03,199
By your side

1014
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:05,503
The capital c

1015
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:07,807
I don't know why that

1016
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:08,575
Should be on Alex's

1017
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:10,111
The show I don't understand

1018
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:13,695
He's completely lost control of the interview like it's just

1019
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:14,975
It's just not

1020
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:17,791
It's just allowing Charlie Sheen to be weird in public

1021
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:18,815
Well yeah that's

1022
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:19,839
What he wants

1023
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:21,887
Controlling the

1024
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:22,911
Debs

1025
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:26,751
Because if Charlie's stopped

1026
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,031
Is Charlie

1027
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:29,311
Really just kind of calmed

1028
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,079
The down was like

1029
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:31,871
Let's talk about the global

1030
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:33,663
Alex Wood

1031
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:34,431
Pissed

1032
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,455
Probably

1033
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,319
Cuz that's what's going to

1034
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:43,135
To notice me and it worked

1035
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:44,415
Beyond Alex

1036
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:48,767
If we talked a little bit about poetry

1037
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:50,047
Panda

1038
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:50,815
Charlie Sheen

1039
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:55,679
Sure

1040
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:59,007
Jedi Mind

1041
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:01,567
One of my favorite poets is Eminem

1042
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:11,551
Not like that sentence one bit

1043
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:16,927
Eminem inspires me to stay violin

1044
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,719
That's what I like in my power

1045
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:22,559
Stop by tonight alive

1046
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:25,375
Now Clash Royale

1047
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:27,423
It's better that you said Eminem

1048
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:28,191
I'm just a violin

1049
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:28,959
Instead of being like

1050
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:31,519
Emily Dickinson

1051
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:33,311
She really inspires me to stay violet

1052
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:41,759
After awhile Lenny Dykstra comes in

1053
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:45,599
Makes clear

1054
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:47,903
Charlie Sheen's got a job

1055
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:53,023
Call me early

1056
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,095
I wait

1057
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:05,055
Certainly on fire my friend

1058
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:06,591
Not good

1059
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:08,383
No sense text at 3 in the morning

1060
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,943
Your time

1061
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:12,735
Yeah

1062
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:16,319
So you may have to work on that Tuesday

1063
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:18,367
In February but Charlie

1064
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:20,159
I got in trouble

1065
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:21,183
I got fired

1066
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:23,743
His contract was terminated with two-and-a-half-men on March

1067
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:25,023
7th 2011

1068
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:26,815
3 days later

1069
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:27,839
On March 10th

1070
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:29,375
Charlie and apps to Nationwide

1071
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:31,679
I tore called my violent torpedo of Truth

1072
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:33,983
The Detroit opening night show sold out in

1073
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:34,751
18 minutes

1074
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:37,311
But a closer look revealed that at least 1,000

1075
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:39,615
It's been bought by a third-party reseller and

1076
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:41,151
Sold a cut-rate prices

1077
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:44,223
Terribly cut-rate price

1078
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:46,015
On April 2nd

1079
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:47,039
Detroit show hap

1080
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:48,063
Which is the opener

1081
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:49,343
The tour

1082
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:50,111
And it was

1083
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:51,903
His opening act

1084
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:53,951
Stand-up comedian got booed off stage

1085
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:58,815
6:20

1086
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:04,703
I am Gathering of the Juggalos

1087
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:08,287
Those are the two that Giggs I don't want to

1088
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:09,055
I have no idea

1089
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:11,615
I knew a guy

1090
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:13,407
No I think

1091
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:16,479
When around opening

1092
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:17,759
For Screech

1093
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:22,367
It was described it as

1094
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,183
Are you go to casinos you have to

1095
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:26,719
Do 10 minutes

1096
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:27,743
Plenty of money

1097
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:31,071
And very shortly thereafter he was a

1098
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:33,887
Party screeches

1099
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:36,191
So

1100
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:37,983
You're having the money part is nice

1101
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:39,263
Since you don't care about all the stuff

1102
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:41,567
Comes along with that

1103
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:44,639
I have to drive around with Screech all day that does not sound

1104
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:48,479
Violent torpedo of Truth tour in Detroit

1105
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:49,759
Seems

1106
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:52,575
Equally bad I want to know who that guy

1107
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:58,207
I probably could have figured out but I didn't want to look into it just in case

1108
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:01,535
Even if

1109
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:02,559
Sing his name is

1110
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:04,095
It feels pretty

1111
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:06,911
Talking about the

1112
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:12,287
People who were in Charlie Sheen's life who aren't named Lenny Dykstra

1113
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:14,335
Because in some ways

1114
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:15,359
Maybe they're

1115
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:16,895
Actions were complicit in

1116
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:18,175
Like enabling him

1117
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:19,199
Stuff like that

1118
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:20,735
But I don't feel

1119
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:22,527
I don't I don't feel like it

1120
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:27,135
It's necessary to point a finger at them

1121
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:28,671
Just did

1122
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:31,231
I think I would take that game

1123
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:37,631
For the story is maybe it's a great game either way you're open

1124
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:39,167
Hang up for Charlie Sheen

1125
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:44,287
Losing is f****** my I would I would I would like to do is I get that invitation

1126
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:45,311
I say

1127
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:50,431
No but Jordan perfect for it and then I come along and I watch

1128
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:54,015
Call Austin good

1129
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:59,647
That would be the most satisfying booed off stage of my life

1130
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:04,255
Alex has Charlie Sheen

1131
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:06,815
Michelle to ramble for 40 minutes like an 80

1132
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:12,191
During which time

1133
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:12,959
Call

1134
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:14,495
Chuck Lorre

1135
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:16,543
I'm Lovin

1136
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:18,335
Throws

1137
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:20,383
Very dog-whistle a Jewish

1138
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:21,151
Consult

1139
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,991
Crazy person

1140
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:25,759
And it does

1141
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:27,551
End up going viral and it leads

1142
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:28,831
To him getting fired

1143
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:34,463
Community Behavior after-the-fact didn't help

1144
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:36,255
Get a raise

1145
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:41,887
Alex didn't do all of it but

1146
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:43,935
Started this ball down the road

1147
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:45,215
I guess actually probably

1148
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:46,495
Be having to hold

1149
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:48,287
Production to go to rehab

1150
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:55,711
That certainly plays a part in it but I think a lot of it could have been smoothed out if you didn't go on

1151
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:57,503
The national radio show

1152
00:57:57,759 --> 00:58:00,319
And say those things about Chuck Lorre and then also say

1153
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:02,879
He won't do his job

1154
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:05,183
Cans into gold

1155
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:06,719
I think that you could probably on

1156
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:09,791
The damage that you do to halting production

1157
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:11,583
Because of your addiction problem

1158
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:14,143
I think you could probably smooth that out

1159
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:17,215
But this is too far because this is

1160
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:19,263
The reason that he kept going

1161
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:21,567
Probably

1162
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:24,383
Everybody wants

1163
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:26,431
To talk to him about the interview

1164
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:30,783
Even more even a larger platform

1165
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:32,063
To say his crazy

1166
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:33,599
I meant Alex Jones

1167
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:36,671
Love you too publicly defend him. Stokes the fires

1168
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:37,695
Even further

1169
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:39,487
Fired

1170
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:41,535
And then almost immediately

1171
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:42,559
Store

1172
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:43,583
Thanks Amigos on the

1173
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:46,911
I want to talk a little bit more about the Detroit show

1174
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:47,935
It's such a

1175
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:50,495
Like I got that his opening act

1176
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:52,287
Gets booed off stage

1177
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:53,567
F*** is going on

1178
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:55,103
Cuz it was supposed to have a rocket

1179
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:55,871
Party

1180
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:59,199
Rockstar atmosphere like I don't want to hear that guy DuPont

1181
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:02,527
Turned immediately

1182
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,599
About 20 minutes after the actual show starts

1183
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:07,903
The Boost are being directed at Charlie

1184
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:09,951
Because he's just rambling a bunch of bulshit

1185
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:11,231
You start

1186
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:13,791
The show-off playing like weird video packages

1187
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:16,863
And stuff and having his goddesses come out on stage

1188
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:17,887
Great people are just

1189
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:19,167
Not f****** Intuit

1190
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:21,983
They start about 20 minutes

1191
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:22,751
Pretty quick

1192
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:23,519
Best route

1193
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:25,823
I think that is just a

1194
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:28,383
Celebrity would give a grace period of more than 20

1195
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:30,175
It turns out you don't

1196
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:33,759
So in response to all the Boos he says

1197
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:36,063
Quote I already got your money dude

1198
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:38,623
Which does not make the crowd happier

1199
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:43,231
Sheen says he's going to quote tell some stories about crack

1200
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:46,559
I figured Detroit was a good place to tell some crack story

1201
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:49,375
This comment not surprisingly does not go over well

1202
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:51,935
Quotes

1203
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:53,471
A few people raised their hands

1204
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:57,311
I don't do anymore good f****** night to do some crap

1205
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:59,615
The audience Boos

1206
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:06,527
About an hour in people start walking

1207
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:07,807
Hangout is Charlie composes

1208
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:08,831
The tweet on stage

1209
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:12,159
Later Charlie Play the rap track he made with Snoop Dogg

1210
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:15,231
They would be there but he was a no-show

1211
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:16,511
Because he was performing

1212
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:19,071
Nickelodeon Kids Choice Awards

1213
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:23,167
Does a tragic how far how far away was that from

1214
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:26,239
Is it Los Angeles

1215
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:28,543
Do the show is taped

1216
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:33,407
Elephant the room we've not really addressed

1217
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:34,431
Too much is

1218
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:36,991
Charlie Sheen came out

1219
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:38,271
And publicly acknowledged

1220
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:39,039
Videos HIV

1221
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:42,879
A lot of the stuff

1222
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:43,647
About

1223
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:44,927
The chaos in his life

1224
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:46,207
I believe he's

1225
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:47,743
Traced some of it towards

1226
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:48,767
Like they're being a

1227
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:49,535
The parallel path

1228
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:52,351
Like dealing with a diagnosis

1229
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,631
Yeah stuff like that

1230
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:55,167
His personal life

1231
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:56,703
And all that

1232
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:57,471
The stuff

1233
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:59,519
It is a relates to that

1234
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:00,543
I don't really want to talk

1235
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:01,823
Right I feel

1236
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:05,151
I feel very weird talking about any of that

1237
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:06,943
I don't I don't know

1238
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:10,527
You know you read about people's personal private lives

1239
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:12,831
You hear something that's pretty

1240
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:13,599
Messed up

1241
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:14,367
Here

1242
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:15,647
Their side of it

1243
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:16,671
I don't I just don't want to

1244
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:18,975
It's not really important for our Shout

1245
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:19,999
But

1246
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:22,303
He was coming out and Pub

1247
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:23,327
We talked about that

1248
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:24,351
Hugo on

1249
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:25,119
The claim that the

1250
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:26,143
Entire episode

1251
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:26,911
Of his

1252
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:28,191
Tiger blood

1253
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:32,031
I have portrait coming out of my fingers

1254
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:34,079
Vatican assassins nonsense

1255
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:35,615
I was all about

1256
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:37,151
Quotes

1257
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:38,943
The ABC News Good Morning America

1258
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:41,247
Life quotes

1259
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:42,527
It's fun to kind of watch

1260
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:45,087
Sometimes but also it's just a little printable

1261
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:47,135
It's like what the hell was that

1262
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:49,695
I was doing way too much testosterone cream

1263
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:51,231
I'm trying to get the old libido up

1264
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:51,999
He added

1265
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:53,279
Call

1266
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:54,559
Listen to basically a Roid Rage

1267
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:56,351
That whole Odyssey

1268
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:58,399
That was basically an accidental Roid Rage

1269
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:01,983
I mean

1270
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:02,751
Is that

1271
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:03,775
Possible

1272
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:04,799
I doubt it

1273
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:06,591
Doesn't feel like

1274
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:07,615
I feel like you

1275
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:08,639
Probably doing it

1276
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:11,455
Yeah it feels right

1277
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:14,015
But also you probably was doing this testosterone Clinic

1278
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:15,807
I know the reason I wanted to

1279
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:17,599
Leave with that or sort of

1280
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:19,903
Almost makes

1281
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:21,183
As much

1282
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:23,743
Because you see a guy like him

1283
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:27,327
You know aging you can see his

1284
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:31,167
He's going through an all that

1285
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:32,191
And apparently

1286
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:32,959
He got

1287
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:36,799
Multiple pornstars around him at all the time with Brooke

1288
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:40,127
Brooke Shields no Brooke Mueller

1289
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:41,151
Berkeley

1290
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:42,687
The biggest third wife

1291
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:46,271
Yeah I can I can definitely see the

1292
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:48,575
That he would place

1293
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:49,855
Himself and then of course

1294
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:52,159
Insecurities

1295
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:52,927
Stuff like

1296
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:54,463
Trying to

1297
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:56,511
Turn himself into

1298
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,047
Far more of a man

1299
01:02:58,303 --> 01:02:59,583
Thunderman that he project

1300
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:03,679
Languages like

1301
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:07,007
Keep using tiger blood

1302
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:10,847
I think it's the title of the era in his life through the years

1303
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:12,639
That is projection

1304
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:14,943
Image of masculinity that adorable person

1305
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:16,479
It would be impossible to live up to

1306
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:18,015
Especially someone who's like

1307
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:20,575
50 55 60

1308
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:21,599
I don't know how old

1309
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:22,623
You probably

1310
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:25,695
Anyway the other thing that I want to point out

1311
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:28,767
Is that maybe one of the reasons that Alex Jones

1312
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:29,791
Doesn't want

1313
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:32,351
Necessarily publicly

1314
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:36,447
Talk so much about them being friends although I agree with your

1315
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:37,471
Yours

1316
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:38,495
Ascent method

1317
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:43,103
Throw him under the bus what do you mean you said you were suggesting

1318
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:45,919
As good friends anymore any

1319
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:47,199
Like that

1320
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:48,735
He does still bring him up from time

1321
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:52,575
The reason that I think he doesn't go around

1322
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:53,599
And like

1323
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:54,367
Flaunt

1324
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:55,135
That like

1325
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:58,719
I had Charlie Sheen on and that caused all this

1326
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:01,791
Was because of had negatively it all played out

1327
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:03,583
And because now

1328
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:04,607
In present day

1329
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:06,655
He's blaming it on artificial

1330
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:08,191
Testosterone boosters

1331
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:10,239
What is Alex Jones's name business

1332
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:13,055
That's a good point I think

1333
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:13,823
That if

1334
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:18,687
Charlie Sheen is talking about how cringey it is to look back at this period of his life

1335
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:22,271
Because of testosterone products giving him Roid Rage

1336
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:24,575
That kind of undercuts

1337
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:25,599
Super male vitality

1338
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:33,023
Indicates that ik maybe Alex's behavior is do that sort of thing too

1339
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:34,815
And I think the parallels

1340
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:37,375
Are shockingly easy

1341
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:40,959
AI

1342
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:42,495
Piece of Alex Jones history

1343
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:44,287
It said was

1344
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:48,895
Little more uncomfortable to listen to than I expected today

1345
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:50,175
Like this

1346
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:54,527
Reminds me of where we were whenever all of this stuff

1347
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:58,111
What's happening I just remember

1348
01:04:59,135 --> 01:04:59,647
Remember

1349
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:01,183
Couldn't

1350
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:02,719
Couldn't partake

1351
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:07,071
Like I feel the same way right now like I want to I want to have

1352
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:08,351
The distance to

1353
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:10,143
Start to find this funny again

1354
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:11,679
But this really just makes me

1355
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:12,447
Smithfield

1356
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:13,983
Burning Stimpy

1357
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:16,287
This is Amanda

1358
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:17,311
Drawing himself

1359
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:19,615
And the fact that a lot of people laugh

1360
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:21,151
About it is

1361
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:24,223
Like at the Liberty

1362
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:26,527
I don't give a s***

1363
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:28,575
Intellectual

1364
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:31,903
You and I both got a good laugh out of the

1365
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:35,231
First one's a piss test the next one's going to your mouth

1366
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:41,375
That would have been a great line for the

1367
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:42,655
Detroit

1368
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:44,447
The next one's going in your mouth

1369
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:48,543
And it won't get you high that's a keeper

1370
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:52,639
That would not have got the opening act booed off stage

1371
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:54,431
So anyways this has been fun

1372
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:55,967
Alberta Indiana

1373
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:57,503
Also ultimately

1374
01:05:57,759 --> 01:05:58,271
Comfortable

1375
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:02,111
Knowledge

1376
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:05,695

Twitter knowledge underscore fight on Twitter

1380
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:22,847
And we are doing the March Madness bracket

1381
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:25,663
We can vote on the religious sound bites

1382
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:26,943
We had today

1383
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:30,015
Facebook group go home and tell your mother you're brilliant

1384
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:32,319

01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:34,367

1386
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:35,135
One person

1387
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:42,303
