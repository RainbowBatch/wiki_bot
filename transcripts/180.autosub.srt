1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alex

2
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:16,128
Beverages

3
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:17,408
Dad

4
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:19,968
If you

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:20,992
Just stop

6
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:22,784
Just like

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,576
Take a motorcycle ride

8
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:26,368
From the east coast of the

9
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:28,928
Intercontinental

10
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:30,720
Across the

11
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:32,256
I use the wrong word

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,824
Directions to the Sheraton

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,712
I feel like you were tired of it based on you having to do all the heavy lifting I didn't even respond to you

14
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:55,296
With the same thing

15
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,672
I've been getting a lot of criticism has been levied that you do know a lot about Alex

16
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:08,608
Just change the introduction of we'd sit around and drink novelty beverage and talk about Alex Jones

17
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:09,376
Speakers

18
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:13,984
At this point they're much more recovery

19
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,288
I don't know I think that maybe

20
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:22,944
2 years ago whenever we started this whole thing up about

21
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:25,248
Mentally unwell

22
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:30,368
Perhaps much bigger tolerance for listening to Alex Jones

23
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,392
Right

24
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:34,720
And he wasn't near almost relation

25
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:37,024
Wasn't nearly as awful

26
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,328
Present I mean boring

27
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,376
Still listen to his 20s

28
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,144
16 chip

29
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,472
But something has changed

30
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,800
It's not as satisfying to me anyways

31
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,872
Head further as we've got a long I have come to

32
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:54,176
To the point where we talked about this

33
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,968
Here and there

34
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:58,016
The bigger revelation

35
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,040
That we learned

36
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:02,624
From watching him and studying him is that like he is at

37
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:03,648
Larger

38
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,416
Ecosystem

39
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,440
I'm busy

40
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:07,488
Really are bigger message

41
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:10,304
Is it almost everybody who is a

42
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,096
Speaking role

43
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:12,864
On the right

44
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,144
Is a clone person

45
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,704
They're trying to defraud

46
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,032
That is the game

47
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:26,432
Symptom of a bigger thing through like the Project Camelot isn't right wing

48
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:32,576
There's

49
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:35,904
Yeah there's that end up even more

50
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,952
Talk about other

51
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,744
Very clear hucksters

52
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,048
Alex Jones

53
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,840
Anything like that but I feel like working

54
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,496
I don't I don't I don't feel like it's a holding pattern or anything like that but I feel like we're on the cusp of

55
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,264
Evolving

56
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:52,544
Sing new

57
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,384
Not not abandoning what we have been

58
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,408
But

59
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,480
I think I can speak for both of us

60
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:05,344
Episodes about the present

61
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,136
We have

62
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,928
Outgrow

63
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:09,952
That is

64
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:10,720
Alex Jones

65
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,792
Maybe intellectual

66
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,096
Leave Alexandra.

67
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:16,864
Just cuz I still

68
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,168
The easiest person to

69
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,704
Illustrate a lot of these

70
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,984
It's about

71
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,360
To treat this like a job

72
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:30,432
The continued moving forward one of the things that I need to do

73
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,992
Have some sort of intellectual exercise to it

74
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,808
33 some kind of break

75
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,088
Like challenging

76
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,672
Compelling

77
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:46,304
It's not true that we talked about

78
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,584
Singer want to go to The Hague

79
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:58,080
Is that still has this job somewhat turned into a live

80
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:01,408
Little bit of like a knowledge of like a knowledge fight Starbucks

81
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:06,528
Really I'm going in and I'm making coffee

82
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,744
Listen to anything

83
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,024
That is

84
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:22,911
You can do it

85
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,215
This introduction I guess in my way

86
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:31,615
Really a conversation

87
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:35,455
What we need to do really have off their meetings or anything

88
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:38,271
But I do feel the need

89
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:39,807
And put some listener

90
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,087
Anybody has any idea

91
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,879
What you think

92
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,159
We should become

93
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,207
Sakura

94
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,231
View millennial

95
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,023
You're always talking

96
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:49,791
Sing about

97
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,839
Filmont you're always talking about all this

98
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,399
You know the older generation of podcasts

99
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,935
They would go to work

100
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:58,239
Oil in their Cold podcast

101
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:02,335
8 hours a day

102
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,383
And they would f****** deal with it

103
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,711
God damn Millennials you're ruining the podcast industry

104
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:10,527
I really could hear Adam Carolla saying that

105
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:16,927
Yeah

106
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,975
Shut up

107
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:26,399
We're going to keep going

108
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:28,959
The showing

109
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,287
Does that happen

110
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,079
Fascism

111
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,359
Exactly

112
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:40,223
Greg showed up

113
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,039
Thank you

114
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,831
I'm a policy wonk

115
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,367
Refrigerator

116
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:52,255
They scare me

117
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:57,119
Michael

118
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,679
Sassy Sister film

119
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,031
Like

120
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:04,799
That much

121
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,127
You know

122
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,711
Be involved with almost

123
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,735
Incapacitate me

124
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,527
But I realize now.

125
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:17,599
Probably when I was

126
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,135
5 years old

127
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,183
And this is a weird story about

128
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,463
My dumb family

129
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,999
Thrilled thrilled to hear that

130
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:27,839
I was playing like a little like a wiffle ball

131
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,119
With my grandfather and I

132
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,143
5 years old

133
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:33,471
And then we had a based system

134
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,263
That was built around the tree

135
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:38,079
But and he decided that third base was the

136
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,383
That a giant bee hive

137
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:49,087
He specifically knew about this in advance this is not an unheard-of thing he was like

138
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,183
I don't even worry about it

139
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,743
I'm running around the base

140
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,047
Like

141
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:05,727
Like three of them steadily right on the top of my head

142
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,007
However

143
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:11,871
I learned that at one point in time either knew how to make a poultice

144
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,919
I had heard of a poultice

145
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:19,295
Or just put some s*** into a Boiling Pot and then put it on my head

146
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,599
Okay

147
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,391
She has exhibited

148
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:28,767
Zero Down Home Country wisdom

149
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:31,583
And thank God she was there

150
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,399
Is never happened after

151
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:39,775
I feel like if I knew how to make poultices

152
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,823
Goodnight

153
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,639
Opportunity

154
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,943
I doubt if

155
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,503
You did and I had pulled

156
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,783
Over that s***

157
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,575
If you like Jack Sprat and his wife

158
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:59,743
Another weird

159
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,303
World all right

160
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:07,167
We all know this guy we met him a little bit

161
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:07,935
From today's episode

162
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:12,031
It does get weary raising money

163
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,591
Yeah yeah

164
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,407
That is rough

165
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,223
Really

166
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,599
That is the most

167
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:28,415
Ridiculous thing that you could say write a Z

168
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,951
Rich dumbass f******

169
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:36,351
Right absolutely most of yours is it like that

170
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,119
Get money

171
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,679
Is getting some money

172
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,031
The Christianity has back.

173
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:45,567
Anyway

174
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:48,383
Wearying

175
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:51,455
And I can't tell you what that job is because this job

176
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:56,831
By asking you for money but I wish I wish I hadn't said that.

177
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:01,695
First

178
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:04,255
Venture into the world of Jim Bakker at

179
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,303
Jim Bakker Show

180
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,887
We went over and episode where a fellow Alex Jones

181
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,935
Steve Quayle

182
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:14,495
Sort of a concrete bridge

183
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,287
Alex Jones Show

184
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,871
Different gas

185
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,199
Africa Bridge

186
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,735
Benji

187
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:25,759
Nope

188
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,295
That be great

189
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:32,671
Mister myxlplyx

190
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:36,511
Or if I came out like rainbows

191
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,119
He did like a count

192
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,679
Point-counterpoint

193
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:55,199
Fantasmic

194
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,479
Love it

So if I understand correctly

217
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:17,631
As an adult did not divorce

00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:22,751
Name from her parents name forever and ever in perpetuity

219
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:29,151

Doesn't talk much

229
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:01,407
Extensively about him

230
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,015
Is one of the main

231
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,295
Members of the band

232
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,063

233
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,671
Yeah

234
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,695
Yeah

235
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:14,719
You know

00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:17,535
Yeah

237
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,303
Yes

238
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,607
He's not the original keyboard player

239
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:26,751
But he was the keyboard player

240
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,311
Cleveland Jonathan Cain

241
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,639
Okay play it live

242
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:39,039
Sit down at the piano and play I don't stop

243
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:44,159
Arnel Pineda

244
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:48,255
Because it's like

245
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:53,887
Saint most of their

246
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,655
I mean

247
00:12:55,423 --> 00:13:01,567
Difference between

248
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,127
He's like a famous guy

249
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:12,063
Nothing like terms is like recognizability for anything like that most people don't know his name but couldn't pick him out of a lineup

250
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,599
Super rich

251
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,159
And people who know who he is

252
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:22,559
So you probably to get a lot of stuff at the State Fair

253
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,119
To divorce from $40

254
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:28,191
That is

255
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,983
Is that they will send $40 to judge

256
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,775
Just about any 40 bucks for

257
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:35,871
Four tickets to see Journey at this point.

258
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:42,271
Here's where the food or whatever you got

259
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,807

She talked to him the whole time

264
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:52,767
I think

265
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:59,679
Imagine he probably was tired of the Rockstar life or something like that maybe

266
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,447
Some problem

267
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,239
She's a very strong woman

268
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,663
Like that

269
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,039
Maybe she

270
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:17,599
Corrected

271
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,903
Lifestyle issues

276
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,335
But not for me

277
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,615
This was

278
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,639
This is from 27

279
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,295
Disappearance

280
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,831
Free time

281
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,623

00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:54,463
Figured out he said he was never going to never going to get married and then we married

283

289
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,343
I did not expect

290
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,743
I do not know anything about Paula White

291
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:33,375

326
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,623

To prevent foreclosure on the web

359
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,247
Columbus Drive

360
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,319
Polk

361
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,623
The time

00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,927
She was preaching the Prosperity Gospel

363
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:13,023
Imani church

364
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,327
Mysteriously

365
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:18,655
When she's living there

366
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,447

But she was let down

372
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:48,351
By the parishioners

373
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,399
That's why the church would be able to be

374
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:55,007
She still is doing quite well

375
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:58,591
Absolutely after that ended up running

00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:00,127

377
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,663

00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:32,127
All right we got the sort of traditional backstory of huckster preachers

389
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,151
Wrecking everything

390
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:38,527
Blake money

391
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:41,855
Or any of these abusive capitalist Fox just like it says in the Bible

392
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:45,439
Absolutely so she has that in her in her background

393
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,975
And that only makes it may

394
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,255
Make crystal clear sense

395
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,023
Why is this

396
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:06,943
Yes sir try to make it up at least

397
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:16,159
We left you know a lot of people are present love

398
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:22,560
We were at the Kennedy Center for the

399
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:25,632
Freedom and I love it because

400
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,912
Grip for a while and

401
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:29,216
And you just said let me tell you something

402
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:31,520
As long as I am president

403
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:35,104
Football games

404
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:41,504
You can pray

405
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,904
Whoever thought of making Prairie illegal

406
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,464
I am

407
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:55,072
At private

408
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,632
You praying

409
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:01,728
It's due any any of any number of God

410
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,264
Just

411
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,896
Just this one just whatever prayer you are saying to Jim Bakker and Paula White's God illegal

412
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,432
Illegal

413
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,480
Well

414
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,760
Paula White

415
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:14,784
Maybe Trump

416
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,320
Spiritual

417
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,088
Center

418
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,904
She's the one who game

419
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,232
Shiki

420
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,768
She gave the benediction

421
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:32,960
She gave a really pretty hands on him

422
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:38,336
Like that

423
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,616
But that's part of it man

424
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,408
This is all like this is

425
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,176
Endemic

426
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,456
The system that we have

427
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,992
Operating right now

428
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,784
The right wing special

429
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,832
Things like this

430
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,624
This version of the right-wing

431
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,928
Is all the holding

432
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:53,696
Pecan

433
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,232
Everyone's running Khan

434
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:57,536
And so they work together on these cons

435
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:00,864
How can I Elevate you while you elevate me falsely

436
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,216
It all it's it's all interconnected Khan people helping each other

437
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:08,288
Didn't we used to have a system where was every con man from

438
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,128
Yeah

439
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:16,992
Blockbuster and they are running

440
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:20,064
Realize that they could Ocean's 11 the world

441
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:25,184
They started a religion or politics

442
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,208
Whatever

443
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:29,536
Octopus

444
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,864
Crazy

445
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:36,960
Problem is that I mean this literally

446
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,240
Paula White

447
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,544
Okay

448
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:41,568
Like

449
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:44,640
She was excommunicated from a church

450
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:46,176
And shall be put to death

451
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:52,576
As soon as possible ability because he's made many statement

452
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,368
Deny the Nicene Creed

453
00:23:55,392 --> 00:24:00,000
Okay which if you don't know is one of the foundations of Christian dogma

454
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:04,608
The Apostles Creed

455
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:09,472
Our foundation that pretty much every branch of Christianity

456
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:14,080
I understand that and I are

457
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:14,848
Respect

458
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,872
Your

459
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,176
But

460
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,992
So everything is permitted

461
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:25,856
Egos

462
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:32,512
We believe in one God the Father Almighty the maker of heaven and Earth and things visible and invisible

463
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,840
Jesus Christ the son of God the begotten

464
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:36,608
Father and

465
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:38,144
Got the Father the only begotten

466
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,168
What is the essence

467
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:39,936
The father

468
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:42,752
God of God light of light true God of true God

469
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,288
Begotten not made

470
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:47,104
I have the same nature of the father and by whom

471
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,736
And this is the Armenian version but

472
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,832
The same as the other version

473
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,112
Which

474
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,392
Essence of the nice team

475
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,416
Comes down

476
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,184
Come to the idea

477
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,720
That Jesus Christ was

478
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:04,256
The only son of God

479
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:08,608
He was of the same material

480
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:12,704
Incredibly important for every branch of Christianity

481
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,776
Pretty much every branch of Christianity that probably a couple exam

482
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,056
Apples that are in the fridge

483
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,896
Jesus without ever like

484
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,944
Hey what Jesus did

485
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,992
Let's not talk about that

486
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:27,552
Without a plywood Jesus

487
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:28,832
He was

488
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,440
Multiple times

489
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,208
Paula White

490
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,744
Has made the state

491
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:38,816
Quote Jesus is not the only begotten son of God

492
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:39,584
He is the first

493
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,352
Fruit

494
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:44,192
And things like that

495
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:47,520
It's sort of like a Urology well gears

496
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:51,360
Are are we going to the genetic line

497
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,128
No

498
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,176
It comes back on

499
00:25:55,456 --> 00:26:00,320
First fruits is an idea that people for the Prosperity Gospel leave Angelica world

500
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,088
Really abused

501
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,208
They have this especially Paula White she doesn't all the time

502
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,488
First fruits belong to

503
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:10,816
The God so she can courage is people who watch her shows

504
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:11,840
To give their fur

505
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,632
Month salary of the year

506
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,656
To the church

507
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:17,728
Because you give a sacrifice of the first fruit

508
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:20,288
I'm at Usher's with more plentiful Harvest

509
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:24,128
For the rest of the year because you know God going to provide for you if you provide

510
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:24,896
For the church

511
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,944
So even the phrasing that you was using

512
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,480
These times What you talkin about

513
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:31,552
Jesus wasn't the only son of God he was the first fruit

514
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:33,344
That was God offering the

515
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:37,696
First fruit and sacrificed in order to have a more plentiful Harvest later

516
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:40,256
Which would imply that there are more Sons

517
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,048
God which is 8 Direct

518
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:43,584
Camper to the Nicene Creed

519
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,352
And

520
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:46,144
Is part of the heresy

521
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,216
Council of Nicea together to correct

522
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:51,520
Do all of this stuff like

523
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:56,384
Play outside Christianity

524
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,736
Even with like even within the Prosperity Gospel which is

525
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,392
It's one thing to lust after money so much

526
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:09,184
You make it this over about like

527
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,976
You know gives me all this money

528
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,816
You show up on Jim Baker's f****** show

529
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,096
Absolute

530
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:16,864
So tired

531
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,656
So tired

532
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:24,288
Super important about this about how like

533
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:28,896
Offensive the Trump would have her give the

534
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,176
To give the prayer

535
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:33,248
Like Christian folk are like

536
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:39,392
If he had a Buddhist or Hindu person or a Muslim prayer

537
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:45,792
That is not a pensive what is offense is someone who believes in a piratical version of Christianity

538
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:48,352
Presenting themselves as Christians

539
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:50,912
Yeah it is it away they'd like

540
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:59,360
To the the faith of the church

541
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:04,736
No problem

542
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,296
Good good prayer

543
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:15,232
Pictures of bit of a problem bit of a problem for her

544
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:18,048
Go bankrupt the churches

545
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,096
Now

546
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:22,144
Is Trump's favorite preacher

547
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:26,240
And I don't know why they would see a lot of themselves

548
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:29,312
Game recognize game the little bit like that

549
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:34,944
Next clip she talks about how she's been friends with Trump for a really long time I like that

550
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:36,992
You might not know this

551
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,272
Trump logo

552
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:39,296
Prayer

553
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:42,112
I've known our present for 16 years on

554
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:45,696
Sure we'll get into that that in 2011

555
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:49,024

2011 by this time I've had a

559
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,424
Extended relations

560
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,752
I'm thinking about running

561
00:28:59,008 --> 00:28:59,520
Prescient

562
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,800
He said would you

563
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,848
Bring some men and women of God

564
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:04,896
Really pray I need to hear from you

565
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:11,040
Because I really want to hear

566
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:16,928
What about friends

567
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,464
Hours

568
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,280
Talking about God

569
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,584
Talking about what

570
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,632
Where are nationwide spray

571

00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:30,240
So the next day called me if he says

573
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,800
What do you think God saying

574
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:33,824
I don't believe it

575
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:41,248
Good luck keep praying do we have to make a decision within 24 hours.

576
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:44,320
Sexiest things with the networking

577
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:47,648
Difference between Intel screw continued

578
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:51,232
I have to prayer group

579
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,536
And what he was asking

580
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,072
Was I really

581
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,864
Do what God has

582
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:00,960
So we should talk a little bit about 2011

583
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:08,896
Really play around is running for president 2011

584
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:15,296
Running for presidency was like in Norco

585
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,064
Basement reflection

586
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:16,832
Decided not

587
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:17,600
Pursue the office

588
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:18,368
The presidency

589
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:22,464
This decision does not come easily or without regret especially when my

590
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,488
Potential

591
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:28,096
Validated by ranking at the top of the Republican contenders in pools across the country

592
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,376
Night night sweetie

593
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:32,960
By being front-runner published

594
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:35,264
Monday by Politico and George Washing

595
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,616
University showed 71% of those surveyed becoming president

596
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,688
Simpler times

597
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:51,136
Friends

598
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:54,720
The situation from Jersey Shore

599
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:01,376
Got it from somebody was there behind-the-scenes information

600
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:05,984
Trump complained that the woman he was supposed to hand his coat to onstage wasn't hot enough

601
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,824
He demanded the joke supplying is not as rich as he says he were off-limits

602
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,640
Roasters were told to refer to him only as mr. Trump

603
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:15,968
Hair jokes were also apparently off-limits until 11

604
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:21,600
Mr. Tire on his way into the punchline the net worth used in the joke became a negotiation

605
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:22,880
Use a complete

606
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:23,648
S*******

607
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,416
Alright

608
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:29,024
Doesn't sound like a man of God this lady I gave my coat to isn't hot enough

609
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,816
But he was talking

610
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,608
Spiritual terms

611
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,888
Bemidji wasn't

612
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,960
Praying that my damn that's possible

613
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:38,496
Iherb

614
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,336
Interesting Theory

615
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:44,896
That's possible.

616
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:48,224
Henry white coat when I walk up there I want a woman

617
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:48,992
Wearing

618
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:51,808
God damned if it isn't

619
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,624
Chat what's the show

620
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:58,720
That's what I was

621
00:31:58,976 --> 00:31:59,744
That's what I was reaching for

622
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,048
Also funny

623
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:05,376
Snoop Dogg was one of the

624
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,960
Alex Jones screams about Snoop Dogg video

625
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:13,056
Sugandha Trump's head in the bank like comes out

626
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,080
That is all

627
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:22,784
Charismatic

628
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,552
I kind of want to

629
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:28,672
President Obama

630
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:31,232
Donald Trump at The Correspondents Dinner

631
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:35,840
That's what motivated him to try and run for president

632
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:39,424
I don't know if I necessarily believe that 100% but

633
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:43,264
It's a it's a it's a lot of people seem to believe

634
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:45,056
Also

635
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:49,664
I don't know

636
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:54,272
I just need everybody to pray

637
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:58,112
Back in 2011 and then we know what he was doing in 2011 this is all bulshit

638
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:01,952
And let's talk about what he would have done it

639
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:02,720
In 2011

640
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:07,584
First of all he was never going to run because he knew Barack Obama was going to f****** win against anybody

641
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,144
He didn't want to be humiliated by losing that election

642
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,936
The reason he had

643
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:13,216
No I don't think any

644
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:18,080
No cheating.

645
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:20,128
Constructed they had probably wasn't nearly as good as

646
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,432
People as well as

647
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:26,016
Trump

648
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:26,784
Unboxing

649
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,808
Friends quote

650
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,904
You have people in this country for twenty years they've done a great job they've done wonderfully

651
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,464
They've gone to school they've got good marks their productive

652
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:39,072
Separate them from the now we're supposed to kick them out of the country I don't believe in that

653
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,936
Now

654
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:46,240
He's been another six years watching

655
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,800
Crazy broad play Forever

656
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,408
Complete fabric

657
00:33:53,920 --> 00:34:00,064
I mean I bet no way any of this is true

658
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,136
According to every report we've heard from his

659
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:04,160
Outgoing

660
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:06,208
It's like he hasn't

661
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,144
7

662
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,168
That's a element

663
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:18,752
But then also like

664
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:23,360
Most of the fundamentals of this are the embellishment of tala evangelist

665
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:26,432
Yeah I don't think I don't think this is true at all I think it's like

666
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,968
I have my horse

667
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,504
I have my guy

668
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,784
That is my guy

669
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:36,160
And I'm going to do everything I can to go to the greatest Baxter where were intimately involved and he's been on the right side of things

670
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:38,720
Because if I have to rest

671
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,256
The fact that I have chosen

672
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:44,096
To take this card man and believe all these positive things about him

673
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,120
When the evidence is

674
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,144
All to The Conch

675
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:53,568
In 2011 he didn't even believe in the principal's I'm thrilled you than acting now in terms of what you do with that

676
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,360
With immigrants

677
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:57,408
What you got to rely on

678
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:59,200
Is the rules of

679
00:34:59,456 --> 00:34:59,968
The code

680
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,784
She's got the comment coach as long as she's

681
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,344
Helping him out he's going to

682
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:10,208
Corroboree whatever dumb s*** she says

683
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:16,608
We prayed for 7 hours probably just didn't

684
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:21,728
You realize you was in a prayer for a few hours

685
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:24,032
Televangelist

686
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:30,432
They're all liars Liars

687
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:33,504
Crazy

688
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:37,344
Sao Paulo goes on to talk a little bit

689
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:40,672
Norbit

690
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,256
Pablo wants

691
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:48,608
The middle of a story the rest of the story isn't really all that important

692
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:49,888
Kind of just more about praying

693
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:54,752
Coming in the middle of the story but

694
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,520
It's really important

695
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:56,544
She says at the end

696
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,592
Which is one indication that everyone should be like

697
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:02,688
And then within minutes

698
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,248
He calls in any says

699
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,016
Shrimp

700
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,552
Pray

701
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,696
It's a weaker winner

702
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:15,744
Where's Melania

703
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,536
Some others were around 7

704
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,072
Family and I just turned

705
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,632
And I'm just giving

706
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,168
Lyman estate wedding

707
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:29,568
Prophetic declarations and frame

708
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:34,176
No

709
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:37,760
Cut hair to put out

710
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:43,648
I don't know if she explained

711
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,232
She's dead and then they cut it

712
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:49,536
That she had done it in the first place

713
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:52,096
Not what you prophesied was like

714
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,912
I believe the Trump

715
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:59,008
Is going to make everybody clap

716
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,312
But in that broadcast you can't clap

717
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,848
You can't let her say that

718
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:05,152
I don't know if she ever gives any

719
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,432
DivX on the prophecy

720
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:09,760
I know that she does talk about one thing I don't know

721
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:11,040
Here

722
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,576
She talks about how like when she

723
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:13,600
She came to God

724
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,368
But you was

725
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,136
Are we 80

726
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,416
18 year-old or so

727
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,440
I think I think

728
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,768
Don't Stop Believin

729
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:21,536
Reisterstown

732
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,408
Talking about how

733
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:40,736
Real rough backstory

734
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:43,040
Oh yeah she did some drugs

735
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:45,344
Arsenal Bournemouth

736
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:49,952
The journey

737
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:52,000
And she's talking about like

738
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:54,304
I was living wild we had like

739
00:37:54,560 --> 00:38:00,448
Paraphernalia on the table we would be up late

740
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:04,032
We'll be up late with our drug paraphernalia

741
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,568
But even though

742
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:07,104
Even though we were doing drugs dude

743
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,384
Still turn on Christian

744
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:10,688
Easy

745
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:18,112
Enjoy that as long as you're doing drugs I said when you're not doing drugs

746
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:24,000
Sync up music

747
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:25,536
To this guy

748
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:26,816
A real name

749
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,096
We called him the Rev

750
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:30,912
He was a televangelist in Central Missouri

751
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:33,472
He was very like you did a lot of hand gestures

752
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:37,312
Stuff like that

753
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:44,480
And watch him

754
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,832
What is whatever it is she's doing

755
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:55,232
She had a prosthetic vision

756
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,024
God gave her

757
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,560
Yeah but that was that

758
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:00,096
She was going to be on all cotton

759
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:03,424
I'm and that whenever she would speak

760
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:08,032
People would be saved in miracles happen but if she closed her mouth

761
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:10,336
All the evils of the world

762
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,872
What happened

763
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,408
Play Just Like A

764
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,688
Certifit

765
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:18,272
Allegorical explanation for why she doesn't shut up

766
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,296
Alright

767
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:20,320
Listen

768
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:26,720
This lady is mouthy

769
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,256
She is goddess

770
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:31,328
Where is heart attack without

771
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:34,144
Misogynist

772
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,680
Mystic language

773
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:39,264
I'm not on board with any of that right

774
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,032
These episodes

775
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:46,432
Please go for it even feels sad for me trying to edit this stuff together like

776
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:47,712
Point where I can stop it

777
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,248
Because

778
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:50,528
Ever stop talking

779
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:52,576
She just takes little breath

780
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:54,112
And then goes to New thought

781
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:57,952
It is just a rambling like it's clearly she's on some

782
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:01,536
She's probably on adderal

783
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:03,072
But she's got a long

784
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:08,192
She's traveling a lot she's got some uppers her husband is MacGyver

785
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:08,960
Journeys

786
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:10,496
She knows a guy like

787
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,520
Pressured

788
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,056
Each element students at

789
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:18,944
So I believe that I have thoroughly called myself out if

790
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,736
4

791
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:23,040
The minimal and unfortunate

792
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,344
Like misogyny that I expressed by saying like

793
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,648
This broad earlier

794
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:30,464
This is set up for the next clip

795
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,768
So I apologize for that if anyone's offended

796
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:40,704
Some of the ladies especially men to need this book

797
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:43,008
Really feeling the same with women today

798
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:44,800
They needed

799
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,592
Obedience

800
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:49,152
Yes sir yes sir

801
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:53,504
That's what I've been saying yes sir

802
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,784
If you

803
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:04,000
God uses me because I say yes all the time

804
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,544
Yeah yeah

805
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,592
Oh my God this hurts busy

806
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:21,408
This hurts every part of the

807
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,432
The way they speak

808
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:26,784
I hate it

809
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,696
Like if

810
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:34,720
If God was

811
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:35,488
Is real

812
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,792
He brought up

813
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,656
Jim

814
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:44,960
Look I understand what you're saying

815
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:47,264
Interested in

816
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:48,800
As a whole

817
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:55,455
Red flags whenever condiment

818
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:01,599
To me like a maybe you just want people to be malleable

819
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:05,695
Following her every Clan women should really listen to this

820
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:06,463
Implement

821
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:08,767
Women really should read

822
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:09,535
Your book

823
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:10,303
Because

824
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:18,495
That's what women don't and some men too but women don't understand obedience I don't know why

825
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:20,799
The women today

826
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:22,591
Do you have any lingerie

827
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:24,639
Tammy Sue

828
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,943
Yeah I mean there's there's something that

829
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:30,783
You can't get away from that's really there that you're expressing

830
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:34,623
I'm feeling I'm feeling like telling women what to do

831
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:41,023
Search the book that she wrote is about Esther

832
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:42,047
Oh no that's

833
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,839
Blank slate

834
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:47,423
When she gets to it but

835
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,447
It's important

836
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:50,239
The cheese like really idolizing

837
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:52,031
Raise up

838
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:53,311
Hamsters

839
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:57,663
Yeah

840
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,967
We'll get to that in a little bit

841
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:02,015
Paula White wants to tell you

842
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,807
A little bit about what kind of man

843
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:04,831
Donald Trump is

844
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:06,367
Good man

845
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:07,391
And she knows it be

846
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,159
Because of a couple

847
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:10,719
Really innocuous details about

848
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:14,559
And 1 best ways that I can describe him as if

849
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:16,863
He said I'm going to be there at 12

850
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,399
He will be there at

851
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:23,775
Well I can tell you the story just like Mark Berg net will have Wednesday eat Mark Burnett came in and

852
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:26,591
And and he says he's pitching it out he's got

853
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:28,639
Survivor he's pitching the show called

854
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:32,735
He says to him in a picture didn't

855
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:36,319
Shakes

856
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,903
He says deal

857
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,583
Brunettes

858
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:52,191
Dentist office not many

859
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:53,983
Munson

860
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:55,263
After that he's told me

861
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:58,335
Story they call it a big

862
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,615
Can a won the big agency

863
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:02,687
There's two basically William Morrison

864
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:07,807
Navigation States

865
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:09,087
A sister's Asian

866
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:24,703
This is absolutely

867
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,151
Punctual

868
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:34,175
Great

869
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:35,711
Because

870
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:37,759
I know a lot of contract

871
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:38,783
But he's not honored

872
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:41,855
He didn't shake his head

873
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:44,415
There's a lot of contractors

874
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:48,255
I know you haven't paid

875
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:50,815
I think that those are more important though

876
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:52,351
The handshake of a contract

877
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:56,191
Didn't physically shake his hand it doesn't count

878
00:44:56,447 --> 00:45:00,799
I understand English

879
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:04,383
He doesn't know as long as you write it in English

880
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:11,551
Follow up on your right will translate it back to Marion and then we'll figure it out

881
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:12,575
From there but for Christ

882
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:15,647
Play I should have thought about that

883
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,463
Find

884
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:22,559
Punctuality

885
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:24,607
This is how I would describe him

886
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,143
He's on time

887
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,423
Cool

888
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:30,239
Awesome

889
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:31,775
Fear Talent

890
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:36,639
There's no there's no equivocating is a sincere talent to make

891
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:39,455
A guy being on time one time

892
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:42,015
Story into a like

893
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:43,295
And this is what

894
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:44,319
Kind of a great

895
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:47,903
Right

896
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:49,695
We should meet at 12

897
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:50,463
Will meet you at

898
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,023
Can you imagine a man who

899
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:53,791
Can do something like

900
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:57,375
I guess I can

901
00:45:57,887 --> 00:46:03,007
Punctuality

902
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:05,311
That means you're in a tough time coming up with good after

903
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:10,943
Low scale

904
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:13,247
Good character traits

905
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,015
No

906
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:15,039
So yes

907
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:16,575
He was not warm

908
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:20,927
He did not particularly enjoy

909
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:24,767
You kept talking about not wanting to rent to black people

910
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:29,375
Really really wanted us to shut up when we were praying after our our six

911
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:31,167
You kept talking about jeans

912
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:37,567
Jingle I really mention how is everyone blood

913
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:38,847
Really German

914
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:45,503
But you know what that's not bad because now he's blaming the Germans for not taking advantage of another Holocaust

915
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:52,927
Those were in those were in Italy

916
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,207
All over the place

917
00:46:58,815 --> 00:46:59,583
Sort of Hitler

918
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,863
Anyway

919
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,911
Authoritarian leader loves train

920
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:08,031
Trains are big part of fascism

921
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:09,311
Seems I wiped

922
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:12,383
We know one thing

923
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:15,199
With that has got a lot of Prada

924
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:16,479
But he likes to push

925
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:23,135
So the buckets on the last episode

926
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:25,695
Bucket

927
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:30,559
Today but probably a 10-minute responsible commercial

928
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:33,631
For a water bottle that you stop

929
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:35,167
I know what you're saying

930
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:37,727
What are we going to do we have all of this food

931
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:40,287
Let me tell you something

932
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:41,567
If you send in

933
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:44,383
$700 we will give you one

934
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:46,175
Buckets of clothes

935
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:52,831
Now we will give you a second buckets of clothes

936
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:54,111
Watertight close

937
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,391
Very weird

938
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:59,743
Dehydrated clothes

939
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:03,071
So we got a water bottle commercial on this show

940
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,655
They do a very long commercial for this water bottle

941
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:10,495
If this is what I would describe the probably the most irresponsible part of it goes

942
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:13,311
Is anybody else does what they do

943
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:15,103
I think there's a chance they'll get sick

944
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:23,039
Into the rainbow

945
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:23,807
They said

946
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:26,367
Do not drink the water

947
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:39,167
After we drank the water from our water boots

948
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:47,615
And we ate our lunch there

949
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:49,663
Everything and we drank our water

950
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:59,135
I think you're kind of being a jackass

951
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,839
Everything that they

952
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:08,863
Say show me

953
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,143
Dates

954
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:13,215
Add Japan

955
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:16,031
They're they're great

956
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,567
The island

957
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,639
An Army's this is the number one bottle

958
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:21,407
That

959
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:23,711
View

960
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:24,735
Why the hell did

961
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:29,599
You drop that thought about Japan and then why did that guy say I'd hope so

962
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:35,999
Is that a story about Vermont

963
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:37,023
Drinking a clean water

964
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:41,631
I'm guessing if I had to guess I don't know this but I'm just guessing it has to do with Fukushima

965
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:48,287
That's what I would get I'm guessing that they believe that all water is unclean and radiator

966
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:54,687
Or something like that

967
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:56,735
Barback

968
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:59,295
Even if it's just like a random aside like

969
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:03,391
I like to imagine it now as more of like whenever

970
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:07,487
You buy a movie ticket and somebody like enjoy your show and you're like

971
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:09,023
That doesn't make

972
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:10,303
Can you sense that

973
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:16,703
To me it sounds like you just trying to voice I'd hope so whatever

974
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:19,775
Got weird

975
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:23,871
I don't know don't do that

976
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:25,663
Hey you know what I

977
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:28,991
Specifically hope the Japanese are using

978
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,527
If everybody else

979
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:34,623
I am ambivalent about but the Jeep

980
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:35,903
Baker coupons

981
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:47,935
Amazon water

982
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:52,543
Normal pollutants of water that you have

983
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:57,407
You know people who have Brita filters and s*** like that probably very competent on that level

984
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:58,175
Don't trust it

985
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:58,943
To take poison

986
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:00,223
How does your water

987
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:01,759
Here's

988
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,039
We have

989
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:04,575
One-story

990
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:07,647
From a group of known liars and huckster

991
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:09,439
Interesting

992
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:11,999
Financial interest

993
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:15,839
I don't know like

994
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:17,119
Naked and Afraid

995
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:21,983
Going to leave your house to find out. Your water can destroy you

996
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:26,335
Dangerous watch Discovery Channel for a while you'll never drink water again that's just gross

997
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:28,895
Unless you're in Japan in which case you better drink that water

998
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:29,663
Drink water

999
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:32,479
It's like the reverse of that Matthew song

1000
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:38,879
Do drink howold already there's no blood in the water

1001
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:39,903
This

1002
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:45,279
Commercial Interruption Paula wasn't there for

1003
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:49,119
To Paula White

1004
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:53,215
If I was on the show

1005
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:55,263
Have they started doing that water commercial

1006
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:56,543
And the guy

1007
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:58,591
Was there a

1008
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:02,175
It's like there's a lot of smoke on this water

1009
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:03,711
You know what I'm talking about Jonathan Cain

1010
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:05,759
That's deep purple

1011
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:12,927
Smoke on the Water

1012
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:14,463
Every

1013
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:15,743
Throw it in space

1014
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:18,047
Any any any references possible

1015
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:21,375
Lights

1016
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:25,471
If I drink this water

1017
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:29,055
Me and my stomach

1018
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:36,735
Men

1019
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:40,319
I don't need no instructions to know how to drink water

1020
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:43,391
Foreigner

1021
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:45,439
Nevermind

1022
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:48,255
It was not a big hit no instruction

1023
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:49,279
No fuc

1024
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,071
Whatever

1025
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:54,911
Alright alright now my classic rock

1026
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:58,751
Brought water filters

1027
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:06,943
Start

1028
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:11,039
What you going to do

1029
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:13,855
I need to ask you

1030
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:17,439
How can the president

1031
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:21,023
Wristband

1032
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:23,839
The hatred in the pressure

1033
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:26,655
Everything he says they turned it around

1034
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:50,975
I can't believe you say this

1035
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:55,071
Especially if you are Christian right now you have a responsibility that Jesus Christ

1036
00:53:58,911 --> 00:54:03,263
Against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers

1037
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:04,799
She says principalities about

1038
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:07,615
25 *

1039
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:10,943
Against Darkness against Witness

1040
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:17,343
So you know the enemy and the principalities are going crazy cuz princess

1041
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,111
How is Monica

1042
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:24,511
Whole Nations by controlling a person and principalities cannot control this man because he's around

1043
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:30,911
He is a Christian

1044
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:36,543
Beloved prayer and like John said he is fierce

1045
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,079
He has an inner strength

1046
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:45,503
Man could withstand in the natural

1047
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:58,303
Responsibility

1048
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:04,703
About to pray for those who are in positions of authority desire god-given responsibility

1049
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:09,055
You got to play the wheel. Could be done for him and through him

1050
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:20,063
This is

1051
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:26,463
The law to give a little bit of most of the show

1052
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:31,839
Taking those little brats and like keeping going

1053
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:32,607
Randomizer

1054
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:34,399
That's

1055
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:36,191
Quadrants

1056
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:42,591
That is all the stores prayer Place Alex prayer with Alex Jones

1057
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:47,455
Madeline Hunter was that Alex

1058
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:49,247
Brian brings relief

1059
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:51,295
Code words it supposedly mean something

1060
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:52,831
Quadrants of the enemy

1061
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:57,951
You know the quadrants.

1062
00:55:58,207 --> 00:56:02,303
You've got the elderly you've got one of the four quadrants again

1063
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,863
Ugly ones that are important for selling movies

1064
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:08,191
Sheetz marketing

1065
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:14,847
She is so talking and you know the quadrants of the enemy or the markets they we don't tap into that goes

1066
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:22,015
I think that's kind of the subtext of all of this

1067
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:24,319
I think that's

1068
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:25,087
You giving up

1069
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:28,415
She's not even bothering to

1070
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:30,207
To be better at hiding that

1071
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:31,231
She's talking about

1072
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:32,255
TV

1073
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:38,655
Like everything's supposed to be interesting

1074
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:47,103
Thinking about hitting a targeted audience of people who are

1075
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:49,407
Cable and also believe in

1076
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:54,271
Christianity thinks of our enemy

1077
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:57,855
Non-white males

1078
00:56:58,111 --> 00:57:02,207
Look look out amongst yourselves in this audience you old

1079
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:08,095
We know the demographic where again they look at you old white people

1080
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:13,727
Choose any demographic you're against guess what

1081
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:20,127
You know how Alex Jones

1082
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:28,063
People put on victimhood as a sort of a suit of armor

1083
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:29,087
Trump is worth

1084
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:30,111
Withstanding a level

1085
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:32,415
No-Man

1086
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:38,815
Set it on fire

1087
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:41,631
Why they don't remember

1088
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:43,679
And that's because they don't work

1089
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:46,239
Scores

1090
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:52,895
She herself had a Lynch Obama apogee on her home and then she's like

1091
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:58,271
Or whether they want to admit it or not

1092
00:57:58,527 --> 00:57:59,295
Support them are

1093
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:00,831
Largely of that

1094
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:04,159
And it does them no favors

1095
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:06,463
To admit that

1096
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:08,767
No one ever

1097
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:12,351
Actually been killed

1098
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:15,679
Lego

1099
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:17,983
Not yet

1100
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:22,079
The quadrants that we are

1101
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:28,479
I'll tell you that to kill the president except for the one that killed that one guy who was against slavery

1102
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:31,551
That was the quadrant that we were super fun

1103
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:32,831
Those

1104
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,135
You know what it's not

1105
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:36,159
Attack

1106
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:38,207
It's people of God

1107
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:40,255
Jim Bakker

1108
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:41,023
Yes

1109
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:45,119
Pastor Troy

1110
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:46,911
President-trump

1111
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:49,983
It was in

1112
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:51,519
I was

1113
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:54,591
I was going to Warfare physical event being physically

1114
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:57,407
Beatdown I mean I thought I was going to die

1115
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:00,991
That

1116
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:03,807
From one of the Watchers

1117
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:04,575
But

1118
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:07,903
Watching

1119
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:11,999
We're going to destroy you

1120
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:16,607
And they got ahold of one of them

1121
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:19,679
And told him so you tell your dad

1122
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:23,007
He'll never reach again his never

1123
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:25,055
And I had to decide

1124
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:27,103
By the way

1125
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:28,639
I know he's trying to be vague cuz

1126
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:30,687
The story isn't true but you just told that Tammy

1127
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:32,735
Cuz he said your dad

1128
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:42,207
Call Bernardo

1129
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:46,559
One of the many kids that are not his legitimate

1130
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:47,583
Who are like

1131
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:48,607

Could you please

1134
00:59:58,847 --> 00:59:59,871
He'll never preach again

1135
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:00,895
Never

1136
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:02,687
And I had to decide

1137
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:04,479
And

1138
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:07,295
You know what I've come too far thank you

1139
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:13,695
To turn back

1140
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:14,463
If you don't

1141
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:17,023
America

1142
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:19,583
We're in deep trouble

1143
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:22,399
And this this is

1144
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:24,447
Another chance

1145
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:26,751
I think it's over if we don't

1146
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:31,359
Open right now

1147
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:32,127
Global

1148
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:38,015
Stupid

1149
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:39,295
Ideas

1150
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:43,135
Do you think about

1151
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:44,159
Jim Bakker being threatened

1152
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:48,255
To me what that sounds more like

1153
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:50,303
While he was doing

1154
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:53,375
He had himself a thought occurred

1155
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:55,423
I'd like okay

1156
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:56,959
Well I'm doing

1157
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:58,495
For all the crimes that I could

1158
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:03,103
And I can either like get a job

1159
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:04,639
As like a guy

1160
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:07,199
Have a job

1161
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:09,759
Or I can just keep on doing them crime

1162
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:10,783
But doing better

1163
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:12,575
That's what I'm here

1164
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:16,671
I don't like working at Macy's

1165
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:20,511
I don't I don't want to end up

1166
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:22,559
Some

1167
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:29,471
You know some celebrity celebrity who ends up working at Starbucks

1168
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:30,751
The Walmart greeter

1169
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:34,335
F*** that time for me and God the ride for the money

1170
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:35,615
Right right

1171
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:36,895
But one of the

1172
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:37,663
TW announce

1173
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:39,199
Awesome

1174
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:40,479
W.w. answer

1175
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:41,759
Starbucks now

1176
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:44,575
Really

1177
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:45,599
He would sooner

1178
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:50,975
Start a TV

1179
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:58,399
I mean what is the very least you would sooner go back to jail for the same crimes that he is already committed

1180
01:01:58,655 --> 01:02:01,471
Right but you don't have to go to jail

1181
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:04,287
As Long As Trump is in office he is a free man

1182
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:05,311
You will get it

1183
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:12,223
Paula White

1184
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:13,503
About

1185
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:14,527
Easter

1186
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:16,831
Is more important

1187
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:17,855
I don't know if she

1188
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:19,391
Likes a stir as much

1189
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:21,951
Has she hates another character in that story

1190
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:24,511
What job she gets into in this next

1191
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:26,815
And let me tell you something

1192
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:30,143
That side is easy to be replaced

1193
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:32,703
Who is married

1194
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:42,431
Because she did not spell purpose

1195
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:44,991
Cheating and it seems silly

1196
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:51,391
It doesn't matter

1197
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:52,927
She could not be obedient

1198
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:55,487
What was asked of the king because sometimes

1199
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:26,463
Agenda

1200
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:31,839
Until what it was it doesn't matter if you would understand instructions

1201
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:42,591
Young girl actor whose name

1202
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:45,663
Myrtle tree Myrtle trees come from the bottom

1203
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:54,111
What is RAM

1204
01:03:55,903 --> 01:04:00,255
It's interesting entire story

1205
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:03,327
Like that but I would like to talk about that

1206
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:04,351
Oh yeah

1207
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:06,655
Who was a character

1208
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:08,703
If I recall correctly

1209
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:13,823
Does appropriately punished or in the

1210
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:17,151
She said no was he was the queen

1211
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:21,247
Aquarius

1212
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:23,807
Persia

1213
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:28,671
Look the issue is

1214
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:34,303
The translation the scholars who study at the understanding of the story is that

1215
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:35,583
Can't get drunk

1216
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:37,119
And he called people

1217
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:38,399
To bring her to dance

1218
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:39,167
Crown

1219
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:40,703
And the understanding

1220
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:42,239
Is that

1221
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:44,799
In front of them

1222
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:46,335
Incredibly inappropriate

1223
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,103
Request for

1224
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:49,407
Even if

1225
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:50,431
Use back then

1226
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:54,271
Ain't that culture especially

1227
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:58,623
So she said no

1228
01:04:59,135 --> 01:04:59,647
Astro gaming

1229
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:05,279
Once again a great story about dude

1230
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:09,631
This is a bad story about

1231
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:13,471
Look

1232
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:14,495
Ladies ladies

1233
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:20,383
Tell you what I'm telling you about that's why your man walks out

1234
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:22,175
Is that when the king tells you

1235
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:24,479
You do whatever it is

1236
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:26,271
Just like when my husband asked me

1237
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:32,159
Tells me to do because Kim

1238
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:38,303
Did whatever was as women

1239
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:40,095
Do whatever you're told

1240
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:42,911
People people who

1241
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:45,215
Again I just need this

1242
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:47,263
Incredibly clear if the time

1243
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:48,031
In the contacts

1244
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:52,383
Regis Lee inappropriate request for a king

1245
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:53,407
Movie making of a queen

1246
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:55,455
The idea that you

1247
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:56,223
She said no

1248
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:58,271
Like we know why you wanted

1249
01:05:58,783 --> 01:05:59,807
They're to Come dance naked

1250
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:05,695
Jamaican friends jealous or something

1251
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:07,231
Any of those motivation

1252
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:09,791
There is no higher purpose to that come

1253
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:12,607
For me and my drunk friend got us

1254
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:14,143
No

1255
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:15,167
He didn't

1256
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:18,495
Did the king

1257
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:20,031
King's Garden

1258
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:22,335
Done

1259
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:28,735
Well she didn't even know

1260
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:29,503
Zoroastrian

1261
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:35,903
But that's not important the important part is that God of a different Faith who made

1262
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:39,743
The douche it the way that he said he's

1263
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:43,071
What was my point I don't know no

1264
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:46,143
I think that I think the idea

1265
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:49,471
Especially in the modern world

1266
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:51,263
Is that

1267
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:52,799
Which he's advocating

1268
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:53,823
4 is

1269
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:56,639
You say yes to this obviously

1270
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:58,175
Inappropriate

1271
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:01,247
Fusing humiliating request from the King

1272
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:02,527
Because then you'll be able to

1273
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:03,295
Stay around

1274
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:04,831
And maybe have some

1275
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:06,111
Influence later

1276
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:06,879
Which makes

1277
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:10,207
Mesick Trump request for her

1278
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:16,095
I'm not saying my mind isn't in the gutter or anything like that

1279
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:19,167
The idea of

1280
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:21,727
She knows yet that she's not saying

1281
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:22,751
You keep your mouth shut

1282
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:26,079
And then you'll have the ear of the king that sort of thing

1283
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:28,383
That mentality if that's the last thing that you

1284
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,919
She's getting from vashti

1285
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:31,455
Esther story

1286
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:32,223
Ipiccy

1287
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:35,295
Look Beyond even the heresies that she's guilty of

1288
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:37,087
I think you have a really warped

1289
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:37,855
Dirty

1290
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:39,391
Diversion of Chris

1291
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:42,975
Dangerous

1292
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:49,375
You can run up on him like a b****

1293
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:55,775
The king the other thing to make this point crystal clear

1294
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:58,847
It's all about this idea of obedience

1295
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:03,455
That friend is not a accident on the show

1296
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:05,247
The show

1297
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:07,039
Is so much about

1298
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:07,807
Like

1299
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:09,855
Quizzical obedience obedience

1300
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:13,183
You don't even understand that sort of thing

1301
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:14,719
He's very important to be

1302
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:15,487
People with a sort of

1303
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:19,327
They want to put it

1304
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:20,351
I remember

1305
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:22,143
I remember it all the time

1306
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:24,191
I will get you the payoff of

1307
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:27,775
Man

1308
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:30,591
Pause what's really scary

1309
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:34,175
Jim is about to I think make

1310
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:35,711
Audience brilliant

1311
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:38,783
We were not mentioned Miss Earth

1312
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:42,623
We were just sitting here

1313
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:50,047
We were sent here to take over

1314
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:53,631
We have

1315
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:55,167
Yeah it is

1316
01:08:56,959 --> 01:09:00,031
He's not

1317
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:05,151
Hits from the bong

1318
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:07,455
God has raised

1319
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:12,319
Before we get into the rest of this

1320
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:16,159
There's a

1321
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:21,023
Excitement discomfort

1322
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:27,423
Because he knows that

1323
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:29,727
She has the ear of the president and also the

1324
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:30,495
The cheese

1325
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:31,519
One of the big

1326
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:33,823
Megachurch televangelist preachers

1327
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:39,455
Like slumming it here hanging out with Paula White Cain

1328
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:40,479
To her right now

1329
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:41,503
This is like

1330
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:44,831
What I would describe it as like you know on a podcast like

1331
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:48,159
When Jimmy Pardo Paul Reiser

1332
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:52,511
Or something like that we got this guy to come into the show this is very exciting

1333
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:56,095
Jim is really excited to Paula's there

1334
01:09:56,351 --> 01:10:01,215
He's he's trying to preach a little bit in order to impress her he's out of the game though

1335
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:07,359
So you standing up now and yelling at the audience

1336
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:14,271
To the walls

1337
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:28,863
In the Bible game

1338
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:36,543
Used during broker

1339
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:40,383
Into that Brokenness

1340
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:50,367
So I said there's a discomfort

1341
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:53,695
I think what was going on

1342
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:55,999
I would guess

1343
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:58,559
Teams videos working

1344
01:10:58,815 --> 01:11:04,959
Refused to punctuate his yelling with Applause

1345
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:12,383
Absolutely

1346
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:14,943
How do you even know where the apply side begins or ends

1347
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:15,711
The View have in common

1348
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:18,527
They're all fumbling with their boners and not being able to

1349
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:20,575
Hit the right point exactly

1350
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:28,767
I'm a big fan of the weird growth Scooby-Doo villain ask

1351
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:31,583
Is ghost

1352
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:33,119
Who's bad

1353
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:39,519
LOL I kind of love it because it is one of those things

1354
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:40,287
But like

1355
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:47,199
Everyday you get to see Jim Baker try and pull his skills out you know like this show it's kind of like

1356
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:48,479
I don't know

1357
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:50,527
Former pro ball player going down

1358
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:54,879
Park-like trying to play Pickleball

1359
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:58,463
Well they do a good job or whatever but maybe some guys going to be like

1360
01:11:58,975 --> 01:11:59,999
Yes Rocky 5

1361
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:05,119
Metaphor

1362
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:07,679
Good on you

1363
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:08,447
I appreciate it

1364
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:16,127
This reveal will not surprise anybody

1365
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:17,151
Keep talkin about OB

1366
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:26,367
And somebody needs obey God right now because you need to give a lot more than $45

1367
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:28,927
You need to get thousands of dollars in obedience

1368
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:30,975
For the word of God

1369
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:32,767
I pray right now for revelation

1370
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:38,143
Hey man open your eyes according to Ephesians 1:17

1371
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:41,983
The eyes of your understanding might being like that you may know

1372
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:44,799
What is the hope of the riches of the glory of your inheritance

1373
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:46,847
Wow

1374
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:50,175
Putting on a show

1375
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:52,991
How impressive is that

1376
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:54,015
Razor

1377
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:55,551
But that's the payoff of the OBD

1378
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:58,623
You talk about your like

1379
01:12:58,879 --> 01:12:59,647
View is obey

1380
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:01,183
Earlier introduced

1381
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:03,487
The concept of $45

1382
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:09,631
Because is the 45th president

1383
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:12,447
Give your give your Easter sale gift to God or whatever

1384
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:15,519
They always do like symbolic meanings

1385
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:18,335
Bible verse that's like

1386
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:20,383
Do you know something like that

1387
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:23,967
Specific example Paula White has been like

1388
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:28,063
Give me $818 in a year on a monthly basis

1389
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:30,111
Black because that adds up to the scripture

1390
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:41,631
It's all magic I don't give a s*** I don't think I don't think that asking people to support you

1391
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:45,471
Creative Endeavors or whatever like that is a negative thing

1392
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:47,007
I think at the waves at this

1393
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:48,799
Sort of

1394
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:50,591
Economy has come up

1395
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:51,359
Supporting artists

1396
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:52,383
Create stuff

1397
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:54,431
All the people who support or show I think

1398
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:55,199
Great

1399
01:13:55,455 --> 01:14:00,319
But if I were to come up and try and manipulative trick people into donating to us

1400
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:06,975
It would be as evil and ugly is this on the level

1401
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:10,303
Using to do it like this manipulative

1402
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:13,887
There is a reason to do it like this cuz it works better

1403
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:16,191
Exactly

1404
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:21,311
If you would look if we had a GoFundMe

1405
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:23,871
And I was like

1406
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:26,687
We're going to put out a better show

1407
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:31,551
Like people would not be as driven to that as it as opposed to if we all the sudden we was like if your soul

1408
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:32,831
Anna has cancer

1409
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:36,927
Dan is dying $50,000

1410
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:40,255
Which is this turned out in Ephesians

1411
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:41,279
50

1412
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:42,815
Thousand-dollar verse

1413
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:45,631
Right

1414
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:50,751
We would get more money then then that strings

1415
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:54,847
Is there a lotion and stuff like that you're able to get them

1416
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:57,919
You override the part of your brain that works

1417
01:14:58,175 --> 01:14:59,199
On a rational

1418
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:00,735
You overwhelmed with this

1419
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:01,759
Emotional response

1420
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:04,831
Much as I did the last time

1421
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:05,855
Listen

1422
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:07,135
Jim Bakker where he like

1423
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:08,415
The swelling music

1424
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:10,207
Vinny Appice

1425
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:13,279
Great but like listening to Paula

1426
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:14,559
I kind of understood

1427
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:15,839
Like how you could

1428
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:17,375
Tricked into

1429
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:19,679
Almost a hypnotic state by the way she's

1430
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:24,287
Oh no absolute the quick measure like they're the measure of her speech

1431
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:25,567
Never ends a sentence

1432
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:27,103
It always leads into something else

1433
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:28,383
There's always a reference

1434
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:29,151
Mister something

1435
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:31,199
I like it's all

1436
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:33,247
Ostensibly

1437
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:35,551
Some sort of biblical truth when she's

1438
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:36,575
You just making s*** up

1439
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:40,159
She's trying to run a Non-Stop

1440
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:42,975
See how it works

1441
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:45,535
Take ethics

1442
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:46,559
Morality out of it

1443
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:48,607
I respect it

1444
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:50,143
In the same way that I respect

1445
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:50,911
Alex's

1446
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:51,679
Former gift

1447
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:57,567
Broadcaster I respect this in terms of like I know what you're doing you're trying

1448
01:15:57,823 --> 01:15:58,335
How to get people to

1449
01:15:58,591 --> 01:15:59,103
To give you money

1450
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:00,895
With the with the

1451
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:07,551
Michelle around the Eminem of Christianity

1452
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:11,391
I want money you trick people in with bright colors

1453
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:13,695
Subpar chocolate

1454
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:14,463
Another like

1455
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:15,743
AT-AT

1456
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:17,791
8

1457
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:19,583
So similar to if

1458
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:20,607
You've been like

1459
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:21,887
If you been doing stand-up

1460
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:22,655
Persolog

1461
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:23,423
At a certain point

1462
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:24,191
Don't you stop

1463
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:24,959
You stopped seeing

1464
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:26,751
Jokes and you start

1465
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:27,519
People

1466
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:28,543
You start seeing

1467
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:30,847
The sleight of hand

1468
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:32,383
Wright's just the rhythm

1469
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:33,151
This is just

1470
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:36,223
You pause for butt and then

1471
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:38,015
And that that's all you need to do

1472
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:39,551
She is got that

1473
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:41,343
Patter down so good

1474
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:46,719
You can even now even in my

1475
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:49,535
State of mind that I am in now

1476
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:50,559
I can still

1477
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:51,839
Feel that that

1478
01:16:58,751 --> 01:17:04,895
That preacher Revival and then all the sudden there's all there

1479
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:11,295
340 year olds going how you save a bit about this

1480
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:12,575
I don't know if I've ever told you

1481
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:17,439
And I pretended to be overwhelmed by the

1482
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:22,815
Lego Baptist Mega

1483
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:24,351
When I was

1484
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:25,375
Like formative years

1485
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:28,191
My parents left

1486
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:29,215
Churches

1487
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:31,775
You are talented workout

1488
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:37,919
So weak

1489
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:39,967
Just another right fields we went to a bunch of places

1490
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:41,247
Define

1491
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:42,783
We ended up at this Baptist

1492
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:46,623
And it was the sort of place where it let me know it wasn't like snakes

1493
01:17:47,135 --> 01:17:47,903
Talking Tom

1494
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:50,975
Is there anything like that right boring but

1495
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:57,375
Soft version of that are like adults would be putting their hands up and Fry

1496
01:17:57,631 --> 01:18:01,471
Absolutely people like on their knees

1497
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:02,751
Like during the

1498
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:09,151
Some stuff like that overwhelmed by the Spirit fall down an aisle with

1499
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:15,551
Not aggressively not like right where the preacher is touching them

1500
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:18,367
Sort of image in my head of like what it meant

1501
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:19,647
We feel God's presence

1502
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:22,719
And like it really bothered me that I never felt it

1503
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:25,279
Until I went to Camp one year

1504
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:26,815
And it was through the church

1505
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:28,351
We weren't going to this

1506
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:29,119
VSCO

1507
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:31,935
Decision

1508
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:33,215
That I was going to

1509
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:33,983
To force it

1510
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:39,871
One of the songs I don't know what it was but everytime was

1511
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:46,271
Our God is an awesome God He reigns our habitats about from please

1512
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:51,647
What

1513
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:54,463
Yeah Johnson

1514
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:55,743
The great retreat

1515
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:57,791
Whatever the song

1516
01:18:58,047 --> 01:18:58,815
Decided I'm doing it

1517
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:04,447
And I like I acted like I was overwhelmed by

1518
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:05,215
But

1519
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:08,799
I ate dawned on me that like as I got down there I didn't feel anything

1520
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:10,079
I thought that doing the

1521
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:11,615
The ACT would force the feeling

1522
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:14,687
Come in and be like all right

1523
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:15,455
You did it

1524
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:21,855
Somehow that would

1525
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:28,767
Introduce the worst feeling I've ever had in my life

1526
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:29,791
Which was

1527
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:32,095
I cannot stand up now

1528
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:45,919
Winesburg Ohio what the f***

1529
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:52,319
I had acted like I was overwhelmed by the spirit led me to come to

1530
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:58,719
I'm surrounded by my peers in the youth

1531
01:19:58,975 --> 01:20:01,023
Who are all like oh my God damn

1532
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:01,791
An experience

1533
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:08,959
I didn't want to stand up

1534
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:14,080
For a week

1535
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:15,360
So I had to

1536
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:18,432
I had to sort of play it out and see what I did

1537
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:19,200
Crying

1538
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:19,968
A little bit

1539
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:22,272
Like I put my head down on a chair

1540
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:23,808
That's the retina

1541
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:25,600
People came over and

1542
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:26,368
Like padded

1543
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:29,696
Thank you

1544
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:35,840
I didn't want

1545
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:36,864
It was

1546
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:40,448
So disappointing on so many levels

1547
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:43,008
Well that doesn't work first of all time

1548
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:43,776
Second like

1549
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:49,664
Why did I do that like that I had it like I thought that I could

1550
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:50,944
Could get around got on it

1551
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:52,480
Technicality

1552
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:53,504
And then just like

1553
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:55,552
Well

1554
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:57,856
Yeah I know I bet like

1555
01:20:58,368 --> 01:20:59,136
But that

1556
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:02,208
Battery that comes up in my head when

1557
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:03,488
I listen

1558
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,072
People Like Us

1559
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:08,352
Yeah

1560
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:09,888
She's trying to get people to like

1561
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:15,264
Overwhelm their limbic system

1562
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,544
In order to

1563
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:18,848
To get on her side and

1564
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:23,968
I've been there see this is why I don't want

1565
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:30,624
I will never now anytime I'm at Pike

1566
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:32,928
Repeat the innocent people are

1567
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:34,720
Desperate I think

1568
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:38,048
Maybe not all of them but I'd say the vast majority of them

1569
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:39,584
Or like me

1570
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:40,864
When I was 14

1571
01:21:41,632 --> 01:21:47,776
Who really wanted to feel that thing that they saw other people feel and we're willing to play along

1572
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:49,824
In order to

1573
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:51,872
Maybe try and have that experience

1574
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:55,968
Right now whether or not they're the same as me and when they had it they realized

1575
01:21:56,224 --> 01:21:57,248
This is all artificial

1576
01:21:57,504 --> 01:22:03,392
What am I doing or whether they're like going to tell myself I had a profound experience

1577
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:09,024
Extra

1578
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:10,048
Human Experience

1579
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:11,584
Something

1580
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,376
Super spiritual

1581
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:14,656
We want to feel

1582
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:18,240
They want to feel something that's not the normal

1583
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:19,776
Day-to-day Xperia

1584
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:22,336
Really abusive

1585
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:24,896
You tell people that you know how to do it

1586
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:25,920
And you got to give him money

1587
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:26,688
Need to do it

1588
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:30,272
Like it's such a natural impulse the people have

1589
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:32,320
Anythink

1590
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:33,088
From history

1591
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,368
Everyone always

1592
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:35,904
You don't want to feel like

1593
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,096
Visceral wild animals

1594
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:45,888
You don't want to feel like

1595
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:47,680
But I'm just a biological a

1596
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:48,960
Do you want yet

1597
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:49,728
Profound

1598
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:50,752
Connection

1599
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:51,776
To something bigger

1600
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:54,336
And a lot of people understand

1601
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:55,616
But there is a way

1602
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:56,896
Make money

1603
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:58,176
Off of that

1604
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,224
Supposed whole

1605
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:00,992
Finn the Human

1606
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:02,272
Psychic

1607
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:03,552
And I think that's

1608
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,600
Maybe one of the most evil

1609
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:06,880
That is ever happy

1610
01:23:07,392 --> 01:23:10,464
Pepe borate like they know they can manipulate it and they do

1611
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:11,488
Yeah

1612
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:12,768
It's so it's so f***** up

1613
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:15,072
Alcoholic

1614
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:20,704
What what else is that

1615
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:21,472
Tumi

1616
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:23,008
If you can

1617
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:27,360
Experienced that feeling by

1618
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:28,384
Meditation

1619
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:32,736
If you can experience that feeling by going

1620
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:35,040
Wisconsin

1621
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:38,368
If you can feel it

1622
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:44,256
I have no problem with the The NeverEnding

1623
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:45,792
PS4

1624
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:46,816
Human transcendence

1625
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:47,584
In a

1626
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:50,912
I have a problem with

1627
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:52,704
The

1628
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:53,728
Commodification

1629
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:54,752
Manipulation

1630
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:56,800
You know I don't even have a problem with that

1631
01:23:57,056 --> 01:24:00,896
I think I have a problem with you guys today that it is

1632
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:03,456
If we include like going to the gym

1633
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:09,600
Sometimes being able to be transcended

1634
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:10,624
But

1635
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:13,952
I got the same

1636
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:16,512
Is the gym doesn't Market itself as a sump

1637
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:18,304
For your soul

1638
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:23,424
Really really f***** up kid

1639
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:25,216
This is a f*****-up for mcritchie

1640
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:29,056
Like this is all f*** this whole f****** thing

1641
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:31,872
I don't know I don't know

1642
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:34,944
I guess my problem is whenever people try and tell you

1643
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:42,880
Because look if you're going for a f****** spiritual experience

1644
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:45,440
Human history has shown us that

1645
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:46,464
You can find one

1646
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:50,304
I am fine with you trying all of

1647
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:53,632
My problem comes when you deal with these

1648
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:55,168
Who said that

1649
01:24:55,936 --> 01:24:56,960
The only way

1650
01:24:57,216 --> 01:24:57,728
You can have one of

1651
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:02,080
The other ones who have aren't real don't have one

1652
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:04,896
Not only are you

1653
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:06,432
Not having a

1654
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:07,712
A spiritual experience

1655
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:09,248
Your work

1656
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:10,528
You're the worst

1657
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:12,064
You're worse off

1658
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:13,344
For not even

1659
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:15,904
Well that's part and parcel of the Prosperity Gospel

1660
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:18,976
You give this

1661
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:20,000
Seed of the money

1662
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:26,656
How many grows into more money coming back for you and there's a built-in trapdoor

1663
01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:27,936
Doesn't work and if you didn't

1664
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:34,336
Want it hard enough

1665
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:36,640
You didn't love God enough you didn't follow

1666
01:25:36,896 --> 01:25:38,432
I didn't obey enough

1667
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:40,992
Any preacher

1668
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:41,760
Can just

1669
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:43,296
Any preacher like these people

1670
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:45,600
Around that that that sort of thing

1671
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:48,160
There's it there's a built-in

1672
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:50,464
Excuse to blame the person who's the victim of the

1673
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:55,072
I have no words

1674
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:56,096
For how much I hate

1675
01:25:59,424 --> 01:26:01,472
It's

1676
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:03,264
I guess the best word for it is pray

1677
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:04,544
They love

1678
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,080
Turning people into prey

1679
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:07,360
Because they are

1680
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:10,176
AR

1681
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:10,944
Editor

1682
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:16,832
President

1683
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:18,624
So in this next

1684
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:23,232
Jordan

1685
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:24,000
As early as you

1686
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:29,120
Really.

1687
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:30,400
Hiding the fact

1688
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:32,448
She's talking about like

1689
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:34,496
Demographic stuff the quadrant

1690
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:37,312
TV terms

1691
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:39,360
Stuff like that

1692
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:43,712
She might as well be asking what our Sunday ratings next clip was

1693
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:44,480
Pretty you like

1694
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:45,248
Business

1695
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:46,272
This is weird

1696
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:52,928
We're from the same tribe system really well

1697
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:56,256
Listen I know how to do

1698
01:26:56,512 --> 01:27:02,656
I would like to buy a TV

1699
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:14,944
Are trying to be popular we are being purposefully this run

1700
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:21,856
And deliverance is coming

1701
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:28,256
You be the carrier of it

1702
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:32,864
Then destruction will come to you and your father

1703
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:43,104
Enlargement instructions

1704
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:46,688
For real why haven't you picked up my goddamn show yet

1705
01:27:46,944 --> 01:27:47,968
We are bringing God's

1706
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:51,040
See you at 4 p.m. 3 p.m. central

1707
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:52,064
1 p.m.

1708
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:59,744
Grinch meme for the money that

1709
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:00,512
Comes back when you play

1710
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:01,536
Plant those seeds

1711
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:04,352
Very directly about the idea of like

1712
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:07,680
Are you going to get on board

1713
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:09,216
She started that f******

1714
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:11,264
Sentence by saying we can do this in our sleep

1715
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:12,288
We know what to do

1716
01:28:12,544 --> 01:28:14,592
Manipulate

1717
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:18,176
Pulling her dick out on errands being like

1718
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:23,040
I know what to do I don't give a s*** about you guys

1719
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:24,320
You're so stupid

1720
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:26,368
It was still stupid look at you

1721
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:27,392
You dumb sheep

1722
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:30,464
I can manipulate you with my eyes blindsighted

1723
01:28:30,976 --> 01:28:33,024
It's crazy

1724
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:35,840
Another level

1725
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:37,888
Which

1726
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:39,424
Only only

1727
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:40,704
Titan virus

1728
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:44,032
It's not that hard to convey

1729
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:45,824
Is really hard to

1730
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:49,408
And then have them believe you anyway

1731
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:51,200
Some people just like the thrill of the hunt

1732
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:54,784
She's like someone at their hunting boar with a knife

1733
01:28:55,040 --> 01:29:01,184
Yeah yeah she's like open her she's she's

1734
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:06,816
It's playing on New Game Plus

1735
01:29:07,072 --> 01:29:11,680
Barely able to do a straight Swan Dive without a splash

1736
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:13,216
Backflips

1737
01:29:13,472 --> 01:29:15,008
Terms and all that s*** yes

1738
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:15,776
She's nailing it

1739
01:29:16,032 --> 01:29:17,824
She's the Rodney Dangerfield in back to

1740
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:20,640
School

1741
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:24,736
So it is excellent

1742
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:25,504
Mantis

1743
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:27,040
Made me so f******

1744
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:28,320
This made me feel so weird

1745
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:31,648
So there's a relic

1746
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:35,744
Showing up on the show Relic

1747
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:38,560
They don't call it that but that's how Jim is acting

1748
01:29:38,816 --> 01:29:44,448
So f***** up but then at the end of this clip we get something

1749
01:29:44,704 --> 01:29:46,496
That is very familiar to our podcast

1750
01:29:47,008 --> 01:29:51,616
And I would say I

1751
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:54,688
This is a platform

1752
01:29:56,992 --> 01:29:58,272
But the platform

1753
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:01,856
I'm against abortion

1754
01:30:02,112 --> 01:30:03,392
The platform is also an album

1755
01:30:05,952 --> 01:30:06,976
The

1756
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:08,512
He wants to

1757
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:10,560
The Johnson Amendment

1758
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:22,592
I felt like

1759
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:25,920
Evanston open I can't describe this moment

1760
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:32,320
Grayson in this for probably two of the

1761
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:39,744
I think fully understand

1762
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:44,608
Yes sir

1763
01:30:58,688 --> 01:31:03,808
Brown

1764
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:10,720
And then he reached over

1765
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:15,584
Play

1766
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:18,656
What a major moment

1767
01:31:18,912 --> 01:31:20,704
I want to get

1768
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:21,728
I want

1769
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:31,968
You got to get back.

1770
01:31:32,224 --> 01:31:34,528
$45 to help us stay on the air

1771
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:36,064
We need support

1772
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:39,648
Jim Bakker

1773
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:42,976
After almost coming in his pants about a pen

1774
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:46,560
That's outrageous

1775
01:31:47,072 --> 01:31:47,584
That

1776
01:31:48,096 --> 01:31:48,864
Next level

1777
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:53,984
Rootin for climate change

1778
01:31:56,288 --> 01:31:59,616
I have now given up entirely on Humanity

1779
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:02,176
There is no point to any of this

1780
01:32:02,688 --> 01:32:04,224
Those people were all going Apes

1781
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:05,248
Kit for a pen

1782
01:32:05,504 --> 01:32:06,016
He turned

1783
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:06,784
Pain

1784
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:08,576
Being signed for f******

1785
01:32:08,832 --> 01:32:11,136
Can whatever into an ad pivot

1786
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:13,696
Why do we wire really

1787
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:18,048
But do we even meet us

1788
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:20,096
This pan is what happened

1789
01:32:20,352 --> 01:32:22,144
Good

1790
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:23,424
Stop and died

1791
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:30,080
If Obama Henry a f****** pain

1792
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:34,688
This is a f****** b****

1793
01:32:34,944 --> 01:32:36,224
He's like this the pain that I'm used to

1794
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:37,248
Define NACA

1795
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:42,624
That's cool

1796
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:50,816
The Relic

1797
01:32:54,144 --> 01:32:57,472
Shroud of Turin

1798
01:32:57,984 --> 01:33:03,872
Now I'm Anthony big I would not fixed up man I could not go to worship that pain

1799
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:04,640
Dream now

1800
01:33:04,896 --> 01:33:05,408
Adjust

1801
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:06,688
Going to one of these

1802
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:07,456
He shows

1803
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:08,992
And just losing my s***

1804
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:13,088
I want to go. Weaker at the World Cup like the Borg

1805
01:33:13,344 --> 01:33:16,928
Ripping their variada. Everything apart

1806
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:18,208
It would not work

1807
01:33:18,464 --> 01:33:24,608
Oh my God I would have one of these episodes that I watched it like people get paid to come a train

1808
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:25,632
Disrupt his show

1809
01:33:25,888 --> 01:33:26,656
So he's aware

1810
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:33,056
You got security 18 year olds

1811
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:34,848
Probably just

1812
01:33:38,944 --> 01:33:42,528
Alright Google.

1813
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:43,552
Cuz you working

1814
01:33:44,832 --> 01:33:45,344
So yeah man

1815
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:46,624
Let's go home

1816
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:48,160
Beer

1817
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:51,232
So you talk about the Johnson Amendment that's worth

1818
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:52,768
Executive order

1819
01:33:54,048 --> 01:33:54,816
Loosening

1820
01:33:55,328 --> 01:34:00,704
And the Johnson Amendment doesn't know I have to do with churches at barter their 501

1821
01:34:01,216 --> 01:34:01,728
Status

1822
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:05,056
They can't advocates for or opposition

1823
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:06,848
Public office

1824
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:09,152
That's the major part that they really hate

1825
01:34:09,664 --> 01:34:11,712
Right through

1826
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:13,760
It's almost like that part

1827
01:34:14,016 --> 01:34:15,552
Is trying to keep them

1828
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:17,088
Procreate

1829
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:23,232
If your entire religion is built around the concept of a theocracy

1830
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:27,072
That's one part of it but it was put for a 1950

1831
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:27,840
Before

1832
01:34:28,096 --> 01:34:30,400
If you think about what was going on

1833
01:34:30,656 --> 01:34:31,168
In 1950

1834
01:34:31,424 --> 01:34:31,936
54

1835
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:33,472
You had a lot of

1836
01:34:33,728 --> 01:34:34,240
WWII

1837
01:34:36,544 --> 01:34:37,568
Are a lot of

1838
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:38,592
Christian

1839
01:34:38,848 --> 01:34:40,384
Organization

1840
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:43,712
Happy quotes

1841
01:34:43,968 --> 01:34:44,992
2 equal rights

1842
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:48,576
I can't think of any of it with three

1843
01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:51,136
They said we're not in

1844
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:51,904
Into

1845
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:54,976
Yep that's it

1846
01:34:55,232 --> 01:34:59,072
You have you had like sort of agitating

1847
01:34:59,328 --> 01:35:00,608
Groups

1848
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:02,400
Hiding under the auspices of

1849
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:03,424
Of Christianity

1850
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:04,192
And I think

1851
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:05,728
I think a large portion

1852
01:35:06,496 --> 01:35:08,288
Lynch

1853
01:35:10,848 --> 01:35:11,872
Things that the Johnson Amendment

1854
01:35:12,384 --> 01:35:13,152
Is capable of

1855
01:35:13,664 --> 01:35:14,688
What is assertive

1856
01:35:14,944 --> 01:35:15,456
Split up

1857
01:35:15,968 --> 01:35:16,480
That

1858
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:17,504
And I don't

1859
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:18,272
Think that

1860
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:20,064
To the place for political messages

1861
01:35:20,576 --> 01:35:21,600
But if you think it is

1862
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:26,464
I think we have any fundamental disagreement about what faith is

1863
01:35:26,976 --> 01:35:27,488
What are country

1864
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:32,352
The case for a long time

1865
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:34,656
Pretty hard how does the heart sad

1866
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:35,936
That was

1867
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:36,704
Really

1868
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:41,312
Yeah

1869
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:45,664
Because really seem so stoked about it and then

1870
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:47,712
Immediately after the ad pivot

1871
01:35:47,968 --> 01:35:50,528
All of the all of the pre-show screening

1872
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:52,832
Showed up in my head of them being like

1873
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:55,136
Okay we want you out here do you have any

1874
01:35:55,392 --> 01:35:57,184
Gibberellic

1875
01:35:57,440 --> 01:36:00,000
I've got I've actually got this pain that Trump gave me in the like

1876
01:36:00,512 --> 01:36:01,024
Phuc yea

1877
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:06,656
We are going to turn that into a set-piece lie about it being a stripper

1878
01:36:11,264 --> 01:36:12,032
Stand up for this

1879
01:36:12,288 --> 01:36:16,640
You want $45

1880
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:17,408
Time is now

1881
01:36:17,664 --> 01:36:20,992
We need you to really incompetent

1882
01:36:22,528 --> 01:36:23,296
$45

1883
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:28,672
If you thought that $45 wasn't worth it let me show you a pic

1884
01:36:28,928 --> 01:36:29,952
Great pain

1885
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:33,024
We have another

1886
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:35,840
Moment

1887
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:39,936
This one more unsettling the first

1888
01:36:40,192 --> 01:36:45,824
You're the greatest woman preacher in the world

1889
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:52,736
I don't want embarrass you but it matters you are and what you're sitting here

1890
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:57,088
Yes sir yes sir

1891
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:58,880
Broke

1892
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:00,672
What you going to do

1893
01:37:01,952 --> 01:37:02,976
Are you going to curl up

1894
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:04,512
Come on

1895
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:08,096
Because you made a mistake

1896
01:37:08,352 --> 01:37:08,864
Trite

1897
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:11,168
Because

1898
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:13,984
Are you listening to me

1899
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:23,456
Florence

1900
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:28,576
Also wait what about

1901
01:37:32,416 --> 01:37:36,256
About about about

1902
01:37:38,048 --> 01:37:44,192
You should ask her about don't do that

1903
01:37:54,944 --> 01:38:01,088
What is this

1904
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:07,488
Price

1905
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:13,120
Games

1906
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:16,192
Yeah

1907
01:38:16,704 --> 01:38:17,472
Enjoy your cross

1908
01:38:20,032 --> 01:38:26,176
The only people that make me want to take the things from them that they are afraid of me taking away from them

1909
01:38:29,504 --> 01:38:30,784
And you are

1910
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:33,088
Facilitating the continuation of the

1911
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:34,880
The circle

1912
01:38:35,136 --> 01:38:37,440
No I don't want to take your cross away

1913
01:38:37,696 --> 01:38:43,840
You will now I want to take away your making me want to take

1914
01:38:44,096 --> 01:38:45,120
Hear you now touched

1915
01:38:46,144 --> 01:38:49,472
He's actually talking about and why this has nothing to do with religion

1916
01:38:49,984 --> 01:38:55,104
The reason that you want to take his cross away and I think even though you don't care about Christianity and neither do I

1917
01:38:55,616 --> 01:38:56,640
Is because

1918
01:38:56,896 --> 01:38:57,408
He's not

1919
01:38:57,664 --> 01:38:58,176
Church

1920
01:38:58,432 --> 01:38:58,944
Like

1921
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:00,736
The reason to anyone

1922
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:03,808
Would want to be like hey you need to shut down

1923
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:04,832
Because

1924
01:39:05,344 --> 01:39:11,488
The message of God or anything like that myself

1925
01:39:11,744 --> 01:39:16,608
Open to ideas of spirituality

1926
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:21,984
Right but I have no no love lost between me and Christian Church

1927
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:26,336
But at the same time I'm super thrilled I think they should exist

1928
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:29,664
I same as all Muslim churches Buddhist temples

1929
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:32,224
All of it across-the-board Jewish synagogues

1930
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:33,504
I could name them all

1931
01:39:34,016 --> 01:39:34,784
Shinto hot

1932
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:39,904
I don't know I just do the Point Community baseball team

1933
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:42,976
That's the same s*** to me but

1934
01:39:43,232 --> 01:39:44,256
It isn't for a lot of pee

1935
01:39:45,536 --> 01:39:51,680
The reason the gym is so much like people want to tear down our crosses and want to shut us down

1936
01:39:51,936 --> 01:39:54,240
Is because he's keenly aware that he's calling

1937
01:39:55,008 --> 01:39:56,032
Keno's

1938
01:39:56,288 --> 01:39:57,056
Accusation

1939
01:39:57,312 --> 01:39:58,848
Things that come at him or legal

1940
01:39:59,104 --> 01:39:59,872
Accusation

1941
01:40:00,384 --> 01:40:00,896
They are like

1942
01:40:01,408 --> 01:40:02,432
You are committing

1943
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:06,528
Unethical business practice

1944
01:40:06,784 --> 01:40:07,552
Here

1945
01:40:08,064 --> 01:40:09,344
Crazy what you're doing

1946
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:10,624
Has nothing to do with

1947
01:40:11,136 --> 01:40:11,648
God

1948
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:12,672
It has to do with you

1949
01:40:12,928 --> 01:40:14,208
Using got the message

1950
01:40:14,464 --> 01:40:15,744
Spell your b******* buckets

1951
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:20,096
To be like

1952
01:40:20,352 --> 01:40:22,912
We are under attack because we love God so much

1953
01:40:23,424 --> 01:40:25,728
Because I'm at frames the argument for anybody who

1954
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:29,056
This very measured reasonable

1955
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:29,824
Complained

1956
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:31,360
You are I would have

1957
01:40:31,616 --> 01:40:32,128
Has about him

1958
01:40:34,176 --> 01:40:35,200
And that's not respect

1959
01:40:35,968 --> 01:40:37,760
You say I want to tear down

1960
01:40:38,016 --> 01:40:39,296
Now it becomes

1961
01:40:39,552 --> 01:40:40,576
You are the embodiment

1962
01:40:41,088 --> 01:40:43,904
Exactly what he is lying about existence

1963
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:44,928
It doesn't matter

1964
01:40:45,696 --> 01:40:51,840
Of course not. I do it so I might have

1965
01:40:52,096 --> 01:40:55,936
Will f****** take your goddamn cross away you piece of s*** lying

1966
01:40:56,192 --> 01:41:02,336
Go fuc yourself

1967
01:41:02,592 --> 01:41:04,384
I want to sit on it

1968
01:41:06,944 --> 01:41:07,456
Grandparents

1969
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:10,272
I think Jim Baker's whole operation

1970
01:41:10,528 --> 01:41:12,832
This whole show would just be really funny

1971
01:41:13,088 --> 01:41:16,416
If there was just transparency about it

1972
01:41:16,928 --> 01:41:19,232
I think that the real crime is the

1973
01:41:19,488 --> 01:41:24,352
The sleight-of-hand stuff about like what were using the money for

1974
01:41:24,608 --> 01:41:25,376
Stuff about

1975
01:41:26,144 --> 01:41:27,424
BB abusive

1976
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:28,960
Marketing tactic

1977
01:41:29,472 --> 01:41:31,008
And s*** like that the rest of it

1978
01:41:31,264 --> 01:41:31,776
Is just like

1979
01:41:32,032 --> 01:41:32,800
Look

1980
01:41:33,056 --> 01:41:34,336
There are 20

1981
01:41:34,592 --> 01:41:35,104
Problems

1982
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:35,872
In the world

1983
01:41:36,128 --> 01:41:37,152
Someone going to a dump

1984
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:43,552
If there was just a

1985
01:41:43,808 --> 01:41:45,088
Opening of those

1986
01:41:45,344 --> 01:41:45,856
Those

1987
01:41:46,368 --> 01:41:47,136
Release documents

1988
01:41:47,904 --> 01:41:48,416
I think

1989
01:41:48,672 --> 01:41:49,696
He could that he could

1990
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:54,048
Escape

1991
01:41:54,304 --> 01:41:54,816
Exist

1992
01:41:55,584 --> 01:41:57,376
It would be an amazing

1993
01:41:57,632 --> 01:42:02,752
Adult film adult Adult Swim show

1994
01:42:03,264 --> 01:42:06,080
Like if we didn't have so many

1995
01:42:06,592 --> 01:42:07,616
F******

1996
01:42:08,128 --> 01:42:11,968
A televangelist shows on at 2 and at 2 a.m. in the morning or whatever it is

1997
01:42:12,736 --> 01:42:14,016
Adult Swim would have won

1998
01:42:14,272 --> 01:42:15,296
It would be you

1999
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:20,416
Are the exact same thing like this is a parody of itself

2000
01:42:20,672 --> 01:42:22,208
Staind

2001
01:42:22,464 --> 01:42:26,048
Jim Bakker is a person who

2002
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:28,096
Was it hard time

2003
01:42:28,352 --> 01:42:28,864
Time for fraud

2004
01:42:29,376 --> 01:42:29,888
Because of this

2005
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:31,168
Exact same behavior

2006
01:42:31,424 --> 01:42:34,240
The few things and now came back

2007
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:39,616
Story

2008
01:42:41,152 --> 01:42:46,784
It's like if someone did something bad went to prison for it got out realize all right now I know the LIE

2009
01:42:47,552 --> 01:42:48,064
It doesn't

2010
01:42:50,368 --> 01:42:56,512
It look I went to prison for selling I went to prison for sale

2011
01:42:56,768 --> 01:42:57,280
Selling heroin

2012
01:42:57,792 --> 01:42:58,304
But

2013
01:42:58,560 --> 01:42:59,328
In prison

2014
01:42:59,584 --> 01:43:00,608
I got my pharmacology

2015
01:43:00,864 --> 01:43:03,424
The great and now I sell opioids

2016
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:08,800
2dr completely different thing there's no difference whatsoever

2017
01:43:10,848 --> 01:43:12,384
It's more I went to prison

2018
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:13,152
Because

2019
01:43:13,408 --> 01:43:15,712
Someone snitched on me for selling heroin

2020
01:43:15,968 --> 01:43:21,344
I'm Solo or whatever it is

2021
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:24,416
It's cuz it's it's not like he got clean

2022
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,792
Eagle

2023
01:43:30,048 --> 01:43:32,352
What are you doing is still the same fraud

2024
01:43:32,608 --> 01:43:33,376
It's not like

2025
01:43:34,912 --> 01:43:38,240
Just because you didn't create a hotel this time

2026
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:39,776
30 / book

2027
01:43:40,288 --> 01:43:42,336
And she like that do they got him on the first time

2028
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:44,128
That doesn't mean that there's any less

2029
01:43:44,384 --> 01:43:45,920
Like this

2030
01:43:46,176 --> 01:43:47,968
Is marketing

2031
01:43:48,992 --> 01:43:50,272
And that's why it is

2032
01:43:50,528 --> 01:43:51,552
Adult Swim

2033
01:43:51,808 --> 01:43:52,320
In terms of

2034
01:43:52,832 --> 01:43:53,600
It's almost

2035
01:43:54,112 --> 01:43:55,648
It's almost Beyond The Pale

2036
01:43:55,904 --> 01:43:57,440
What you think is like

2037
01:43:58,720 --> 01:43:59,488
This is vicious

2038
01:43:59,744 --> 01:44:01,024
Is not this is

2039
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:01,792
This is

2040
01:44:02,304 --> 01:44:02,816
To mate like

2041
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:08,192
That camp

2042
01:44:08,448 --> 01:44:12,032
B-real that's a lie that she tells him her know that he tells her

2043
01:44:13,824 --> 01:44:18,176
Bunch of pictures of her

2044
01:44:18,688 --> 01:44:19,200
I don't know

2045
01:44:19,456 --> 01:44:19,968
What the f***

2046
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:24,320
Televangelism

2047
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:28,416
Show that was on air that reached Mara Lago

2048
01:44:30,464 --> 01:44:30,976
He would watch her

2049
01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:31,744
You loved her

2050
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:35,072
Melt

2051
01:44:36,096 --> 01:44:36,864
Now flood

2052
01:44:37,632 --> 01:44:43,776
This is the first time I've really believed that God was right whenever he got rid of

2053
01:44:44,288 --> 01:44:46,080
He nailed it

2054
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:49,408
You just let the wrong family like one time

2055
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:55,296
And that was when he killed everybody in that but Noah live like there was probably a guy allowed bees on

2056
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:59,648
Pollination

2057
01:44:59,904 --> 01:45:00,672
Got to make drone

2058
01:45:00,928 --> 01:45:01,440
We would

2059
01:45:01,696 --> 01:45:02,464
God could not

2060
01:45:02,976 --> 01:45:06,048
Rather be fine with that

2061
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:11,680
If there's one thing I know about the Bible it says that God can't make drone other me and Paul are on the same page

2062
01:45:11,936 --> 01:45:13,216
Heritage

2063
01:45:13,472 --> 01:45:15,264
Depart

2064
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:19,104
Music to make drones is not directly a heresy again

2065
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:20,896
The most foundational

2066
01:45:21,152 --> 01:45:21,664
Doctrine

2067
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:22,432
Christianity

2068
01:45:22,944 --> 01:45:24,736
So I want better footing than her

2069
01:45:25,504 --> 01:45:26,272
It's crazy

2070
01:45:26,528 --> 01:45:28,576
It's legitimately crazy

2071
01:45:28,832 --> 01:45:33,952
Rebukes the Nicene Creed

2072
01:45:35,744 --> 01:45:39,328
YouTube you straight up to

2073
01:45:40,352 --> 01:45:41,888
I will.

2074
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:42,912
Denying then

2075
01:45:43,424 --> 01:45:43,936
Team Creed

2076
01:45:44,448 --> 01:45:47,264
If you donate 8100

2077
01:45:47,776 --> 01:45:49,312
18000 $1000000

2078
01:45:49,824 --> 01:45:51,616
Whatever it is

2079
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:53,408
I'll believe in

2080
01:45:53,664 --> 01:45:54,688
Anything for as much

2081
01:45:55,456 --> 01:46:00,832
I will believe in anything for money also in case you're curious the Apostles Creed

2082
01:46:01,344 --> 01:46:02,368
Is the

2083
01:46:02,624 --> 01:46:04,672
Declaration

2084
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:05,696
And the reality of

2085
01:46:07,232 --> 01:46:09,536
All right also a really good song by

2086
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:14,912
Navigate to you know how

2087
01:46:15,168 --> 01:46:16,448
You are just a little bit

2088
01:46:16,704 --> 01:46:19,008
Let's talk about how she does prophecy

2089
01:46:19,264 --> 01:46:20,032
Cilic

2090
01:46:20,288 --> 01:46:22,080
She does. She likes to do proper

2091
01:46:22,848 --> 01:46:24,640
Here's the thing that she had

2092
01:46:24,896 --> 01:46:25,408
Did I think

2093
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:26,688
Is Ludacris

2094
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:27,968
It's 2018

2095
01:46:29,504 --> 01:46:30,016
It's 2018

2096
01:46:31,808 --> 01:46:33,344
You know we don't do prophecies

2097
01:46:33,856 --> 01:46:36,416
When you put yourself

2098
01:46:36,672 --> 01:46:37,696
Position of ibuprofen

2099
01:46:38,976 --> 01:46:39,744
Shaky foundations

2100
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,792
I think most Mainline churches

2101
01:46:42,048 --> 01:46:42,560
You at home

2102
01:46:42,816 --> 01:46:46,400
It's at least narcissistic most churches are like

2103
01:46:46,912 --> 01:46:51,520
Look we got a lot going on with our bulshit as it is

2104
01:46:52,544 --> 01:46:53,056
Concrete

2105
01:46:53,312 --> 01:46:55,616
Man

2106
01:46:55,872 --> 01:46:58,688
I didn't mean anything and you could just throw whatever you want

2107
01:47:04,832 --> 01:47:06,112
A little a little iffy

2108
01:47:06,624 --> 01:47:12,256
You don't you don't give out like I'm going to prophesy this because it's not going to come true and look

2109
01:47:14,304 --> 01:47:17,120
I'm sure Christians Christians believe

2110
01:47:17,376 --> 01:47:19,168
A lot of what they believe and that's fine

2111
01:47:19,424 --> 01:47:21,216
But even Christians alike

2112
01:47:21,728 --> 01:47:22,496
Do don't

2113
01:47:22,752 --> 01:47:25,056
Don't put our names prophecy

2114
01:47:25,312 --> 01:47:30,176
We're not going to you know it we know we're not telling the real truth

2115
01:47:31,712 --> 01:47:32,224
It's not the point

2116
01:47:32,992 --> 01:47:35,040
The point isn't that were telling the truth

2117
01:47:35,808 --> 01:47:41,952
The point is that we're like feeling it you know

2118
01:47:42,208 --> 01:47:48,352
Look okay on the sun and yeah so somebody prophesied that we did

2119
01:47:50,912 --> 01:47:51,936
Felt like we didn't

2120
01:47:52,448 --> 01:47:54,752
Well here's one of the things that's really interesting is that like

2121
01:47:55,776 --> 01:47:56,288
In terms of

2122
01:47:58,592 --> 01:48:00,384
This time is white Paula White

2123
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:02,944
Her prophecy that she talks about with her

2124
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:05,248
Child

2125
01:48:05,504 --> 01:48:07,808
Joe she would prefer.

2126
01:48:08,064 --> 01:48:08,576
Refer to

2127
01:48:08,832 --> 01:48:09,856
Jesus

2128
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:17,024
If there's anything that we've heard so far it's that you would prefer to be her husband

2129
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:21,120
I'd make sure that everybody knows that

2130
01:48:21,376 --> 01:48:24,192
Her choices are absolutely

2131
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:31,360
I don't even like the color mrs. King

2132
01:48:31,616 --> 01:48:32,128
Sup Niger

2133
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:40,064
That she has of her first like old-time proper

2134
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:43,904
Kathy is just as vague idea of like I'm going to be listened to and if I stopped

2135
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:45,696
I will be hurt

2136
01:48:45,952 --> 01:48:46,976
Because that's just a good origin

2137
01:48:47,232 --> 01:48:47,744
Story

2138
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:48,768
Begrudge that that's

2139
01:48:49,536 --> 01:48:52,608
Avenger but I'm fine

2140
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:55,680
Adjust counterfactual

2141
01:48:55,936 --> 01:48:57,472
Real things that did happen

2142
01:48:57,984 --> 01:48:59,776
What year is one that you gives

2143
01:49:00,032 --> 01:49:02,592
About what

2144
01:49:02,848 --> 01:49:05,408
Which to me is a shity prophecy because

2145
01:49:06,432 --> 01:49:07,968
Great alternate Earth

2146
01:49:08,224 --> 01:49:11,040
What are we doing like this is a Multiverse Marvel

2147
01:49:11,296 --> 01:49:17,440
Comic Twin Towers wood

2148
01:49:20,512 --> 01:49:21,024
F***

2149
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:24,352
I was made

2150
01:49:24,608 --> 01:49:27,424
Religious liberty

2151
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:33,312
For oppression

2152
01:49:49,696 --> 01:49:50,208
In five years

2153
01:49:56,864 --> 01:49:59,168
But only understood

2154
01:50:11,968 --> 01:50:18,112
Everybody's like delightful counterfactual prediction that is like hat

2155
01:50:18,368 --> 01:50:24,512
Here's a consequent I imagined for it to scare you about

2156
01:50:24,768 --> 01:50:26,304
Why we need to support Trump because

2157
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:27,840
He is in his avoiding

2158
01:50:28,096 --> 01:50:30,400
The church is becoming an underground Church

2159
01:50:30,912 --> 01:50:36,544
F*** all the majority religion that runs his inside

2160
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:41,408
Country five years

2161
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:43,968
I think they

2162
01:50:44,224 --> 01:50:46,272
The reality is that if

2163
01:50:50,624 --> 01:50:51,904
On a national level

2164
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:53,696
Conservative

2165
01:50:53,952 --> 01:50:54,464
Republicans

2166
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:55,232
Not done

2167
01:50:55,488 --> 01:50:57,024
Traditionally all that well in the last

2168
01:50:57,536 --> 01:50:58,048
30 years or so

2169
01:50:58,816 --> 01:50:59,328
Last 50 years

2170
01:50:59,584 --> 01:51:00,352
Particularly

2171
01:51:00,608 --> 01:51:01,888
They've not won a ton of Alexa

2172
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:05,216
Especially ones that didn't involve George W bush

2173
01:51:05,472 --> 01:51:06,496
He's bad or Nixon

2174
01:51:06,752 --> 01:51:08,800
Which is why they learned how to cheat better

2175
01:51:09,056 --> 01:51:11,360
Speaking of George W bush

2176
01:51:11,616 --> 01:51:14,176
Yeah what

2177
01:51:14,432 --> 01:51:14,944
He's Express

2178
01:51:15,712 --> 01:51:17,504
Is actually probably an accurate prop

2179
01:51:18,016 --> 01:51:19,040
But has nothing to do with

2180
01:51:19,808 --> 01:51:20,832
Church Going Underground

2181
01:51:22,112 --> 01:51:23,136
Eventually

2182
01:51:23,648 --> 01:51:24,672
If people

2183
01:51:24,928 --> 01:51:25,440
Keep

2184
01:51:25,952 --> 01:51:27,488
You know making liberal progress

2185
01:51:28,768 --> 01:51:30,816
Archon is not going to be allowed

2186
01:51:31,328 --> 01:51:33,888
At a certain point people are going to get sick of this

2187
01:51:34,144 --> 01:51:37,728
The words going to get out on us and do our livelihoods are going to be

2188
01:51:37,984 --> 01:51:38,752
Completely bought

2189
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:45,408
If people

2190
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:46,688
To the point

2191
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:48,224
Where

2192
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:49,760
Fear-mongering bulshit

2193
01:51:50,016 --> 01:51:51,040
Doesn't really make sense

2194
01:51:51,552 --> 01:51:52,320
Even to them

2195
01:51:53,088 --> 01:51:53,856
Weird

2196
01:51:54,112 --> 01:51:55,648
We are so

2197
01:51:55,904 --> 01:52:01,536
We need to make sure it was on the side of the coke billionaires in the like

2198
01:52:01,792 --> 01:52:03,328
Is because if people's lives aren't

2199
01:52:04,608 --> 01:52:08,704
They're not going to go in like we get back to the

2200
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:10,752
Now I can't

2201
01:52:11,008 --> 01:52:12,032
Remember

2202
01:52:13,056 --> 01:52:15,616
Right if you have all of those

2203
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:17,408
Bill

2204
01:52:17,664 --> 01:52:19,712
Then you are not afraid of

2205
01:52:21,248 --> 01:52:24,320
Somebody from another country is coming to take my job

2206
01:52:24,576 --> 01:52:25,856
Do you know why I'm not afraid of that

2207
01:52:26,368 --> 01:52:29,440
Because I have my needs met and I'm comfortable in what I'm doing

2208
01:52:29,696 --> 01:52:35,072
Rite Aid of Emigrant

2209
01:52:35,328 --> 01:52:37,888
Then I'm really not going to be picked

2210
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:38,912
Picked up by the

2211
01:52:39,168 --> 01:52:39,680
The comment

2212
01:52:40,192 --> 01:52:42,240
Because I don't have that I don't have that

2213
01:52:42,496 --> 01:52:43,264
Play on

2214
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:49,664
I don't have that imaginary people are offering to fill for me

2215
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:52,224
Of course all of these things are jumping in with that because

2216
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:53,504
Cuz they need

2217
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:55,296
Base level of misery

2218
01:52:55,552 --> 01:52:57,344
Otherwise they're not going to be 6

2219
01:52:57,856 --> 01:52:58,880
But I also don't

2220
01:52:59,136 --> 01:52:59,648
Thank

2221
01:53:00,160 --> 01:53:00,672
FedEx

2222
01:53:01,952 --> 01:53:02,720
Most really

2223
01:53:03,744 --> 01:53:04,512
I understand

2224
01:53:04,768 --> 01:53:06,816
It's very easy and the numbers are real

2225
01:53:07,328 --> 01:53:09,120
Interval especially Evangelical

2226
01:53:10,656 --> 01:53:12,192
But I also think that most of

2227
01:53:12,704 --> 01:53:13,728
Evangelico Cristiano

2228
01:53:13,984 --> 01:53:15,008
The sway of really talk

2229
01:53:15,264 --> 01:53:15,776
Sticker version of

2230
01:53:17,056 --> 01:53:19,104
I don't think Christianity as a whole is bad at

2231
01:53:19,616 --> 01:53:20,384
Very smart Christians

2232
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:21,152
Exist

2233
01:53:21,408 --> 01:53:23,456
Very scholarly Christian to

2234
01:53:23,712 --> 01:53:26,528
Write essays about how Paula White is a heretic

2235
01:53:26,784 --> 01:53:30,880
Things right that what we've done is the world we're like

2236
01:53:31,136 --> 01:53:32,416
Anti-intellectualism his

2237
01:53:32,672 --> 01:53:33,696
Metastasize to

2238
01:53:33,952 --> 01:53:34,464
Include

2239
01:53:35,232 --> 01:53:38,048
Do you have these con men who are like rebuking

2240
01:53:38,304 --> 01:53:39,840
The very idea of knowing

2241
01:53:40,608 --> 01:53:44,960
Yeah probably doesn't like I don't want to get briefed about stuff I don't give a s*** by impulses or

2242
01:53:45,216 --> 01:53:45,728
Are perfect

2243
01:53:45,984 --> 01:53:48,288
Distrust

2244
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:50,592
I like Politics as a

2245
01:53:50,848 --> 01:53:51,872
Things like

2246
01:53:52,128 --> 01:53:54,432
Take politics out of

2247
01:53:54,688 --> 01:53:56,224
Show me dirty game diplomacy

2248
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:58,784
Or international relations

2249
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:00,832
No needs to study that I know better

2250
01:54:01,088 --> 01:54:05,440
Because of my great jeans

2251
01:54:05,696 --> 01:54:07,232
If someone like Paula White

2252
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:09,280
I'm probably have much more influence

2253
01:54:09,792 --> 01:54:10,304
Jim Bakker

2254
01:54:15,424 --> 01:54:15,936
Seminary

2255
01:54:16,192 --> 01:54:17,728
She's not she hasn't

2256
01:54:17,984 --> 01:54:22,592
What

2257
01:54:22,848 --> 01:54:24,384
So she has

2258
01:54:25,408 --> 01:54:26,432
Accreditation

2259
01:54:26,688 --> 01:54:30,016
Christianity

2260
01:54:30,272 --> 01:54:30,784
She comes in

2261
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:32,320
With a heretic aversion

2262
01:54:32,832 --> 01:54:34,112
Of a misunderstanding of what

2263
01:54:35,136 --> 01:54:35,648
About

2264
01:54:36,672 --> 01:54:37,440
Are you have just like

2265
01:54:37,696 --> 01:54:38,464
You know what you

2266

Super charismatic

2267
01:54:39,744 --> 01:54:40,512
Confunden like

2268
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:43,072
Let's let this become Domino

2269
01:54:45,376 --> 01:54:45,888
But there are

2270
01:54:46,144 --> 01:54:46,912
Tons of her

2271
01:54:47,424 --> 01:54:50,240
Around

2272
01:54:55,360 --> 01:54:56,128
Idiotic world

2273
01:54:56,896 --> 01:54:57,408
If that's what bums

2274
01:54:57,664 --> 01:54:59,456
Because I think a lot of people who are

2275
01:54:59,712 --> 01:55:00,736
Beaten this is me going back to my

2276
01:55:01,504 --> 01:55:02,528
Route but like

2277
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:05,088
This is something that I care about a lot

2278
01:55:05,344 --> 01:55:06,880
I know a lot of really

2279
01:55:07,136 --> 01:55:07,648
Good Christian

2280
01:55:07,904 --> 01:55:09,952
June people are my parents are

2281
01:55:10,208 --> 01:55:10,976
Devout

2282
01:55:11,232 --> 01:55:11,744
Christian

2283
01:55:12,768 --> 01:55:15,072
Folk are also they are

2284
01:55:15,328 --> 01:55:19,680
The people that you are also very liberal there

2285
01:55:19,936 --> 01:55:21,728
Progressive is s*** right there

2286
01:55:21,984 --> 01:55:23,008
Very understand

2287
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:24,544
Like the ideas of

2288
01:55:25,824 --> 01:55:26,848
Being

2289
01:55:27,104 --> 01:55:27,872
Adaptable

2290
01:55:29,152 --> 01:55:30,432
Metaphorical on Tumblr

2291
01:55:31,712 --> 01:55:32,224
Have to be beholding

2292
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:33,760
3 dumb ideas about

2293
01:55:34,016 --> 01:55:34,528
Like

2294
01:55:35,296 --> 01:55:38,112
I watched a video where they were talking about like

2295
01:55:38,368 --> 01:55:40,928
Paula White was on another show they were talking about

2296
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:43,232
Why the Prosperity Gospel is the

2297
01:55:43,488 --> 01:55:44,000
The truth

2298
01:55:44,256 --> 01:55:45,536
I miss because when Adam

2299
01:55:46,048 --> 01:55:47,584
Was sent out of the Garden of Eden

2300
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:48,608
It was about

2301
01:55:49,120 --> 01:55:50,656
The sweat of his brow

2302
01:55:50,912 --> 01:55:51,680
He would work

2303
01:55:51,936 --> 01:55:52,960
It would mean nothing

2304
01:55:53,216 --> 01:55:56,032
You'd have all this work it would never come to

2305
01:55:56,288 --> 01:55:57,056
The middle it would never

2306
01:55:57,312 --> 01:55:58,592
It would never be made right

2307
01:55:59,104 --> 01:55:59,616
Jesus

2308
01:55:59,872 --> 01:56:01,152
Had the crown of thorn

2309
01:56:01,664 --> 01:56:02,176
On his head

2310
01:56:02,688 --> 01:56:03,712
And humiliated him

2311
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:07,040
The bled from the Broward it was the parallel

2312
01:56:08,320 --> 01:56:08,832
The

2313
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:11,392
Poverty

2314
01:56:12,416 --> 01:56:13,952
Was thrown on Adam

2315
01:56:14,464 --> 01:56:16,768
And so there was a metaphor of economic

2316
01:56:17,024 --> 01:56:19,328
Redemption that I'm bringing to you

2317
01:56:19,584 --> 01:56:20,608
Jesus

2318
01:56:20,864 --> 01:56:22,144
Makes the least sense of

2319
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:22,912
Anything

2320
01:56:23,168 --> 01:56:23,936
Ever heard

2321
01:56:24,192 --> 01:56:24,704
My tire locks

2322
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:27,264
Just because the idea of the brow the word brow

2323
01:56:30,848 --> 01:56:33,408
Farming is hard and then the other one is like

2324
01:56:33,664 --> 01:56:34,432
Getting murdered as

2325
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:38,784
The literalness

2326
01:56:40,832 --> 01:56:41,344
Scriptures

2327
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:42,880
And I think a lot of Christian

2328
01:56:43,136 --> 01:56:43,904
Get a really bad shape

2329
01:56:44,416 --> 01:56:46,208
And I know that I have now abandon

2330
01:56:47,488 --> 01:56:48,768
I desire to defend Republican

2331
01:56:51,072 --> 01:56:57,216
No I I I I still think I still think I hold out hope and I believe that there are a lot of grapes

2332
01:56:58,240 --> 01:56:59,520
You're you're talking to me

2333
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:03,104
Is f******

2334
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:03,872
Nuts

2335
01:57:06,432 --> 01:57:08,224
All of the s*** that she is

2336
01:57:08,736 --> 01:57:10,016
They would totally say

2337
01:57:10,528 --> 01:57:13,088
Listen to this episode

2338
01:57:13,344 --> 01:57:15,392
If everybody in my family listen to this episode

2339
01:57:15,904 --> 01:57:17,952
I swear to God they wouldn't even hear the ad paper

2340
01:57:18,464 --> 01:57:19,488
Like it would just like

2341
01:57:19,744 --> 01:57:21,536
Like some part of their brains which is

2342
01:57:21,792 --> 01:57:23,840
Now what you saying

2343
01:57:24,096 --> 01:57:25,376
Is good truth

2344
01:57:25,632 --> 01:57:26,400
Prayer is good

2345
01:57:27,680 --> 01:57:28,704
Believe that I don't like

2346
01:57:29,728 --> 01:57:30,240
I get it

2347
01:57:30,496 --> 01:57:33,312
You're just missing the additive apart you realize that

2348
01:57:33,568 --> 01:57:34,080
Your

2349
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:36,896
Ripped

2350
01:57:37,152 --> 01:57:39,456
Because you're focusing on

2351
01:57:40,736 --> 01:57:46,880
Lucy the skeleton of what's supporting that meat on the animal part of it is just like

2352
01:57:47,136 --> 01:57:48,928
My family is

2353
01:57:49,184 --> 01:57:50,464
They're wonderful beautiful

2354
01:57:51,232 --> 01:57:54,048

01:57:54,304 --> 01:57:58,144
I'm not going to paint my family is something awful like

2356
01:57:58,400 --> 01:57:59,168
They will give you a

2357
01:58:00,704 --> 01:58:06,336
No need to whatever your face is for like an old person is

2358
01:58:06,592 --> 01:58:07,360
Sure but

2359
01:58:07,872 --> 01:58:08,384
If if

2360
01:58:11,456 --> 01:58:12,224
You can't

2361
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:14,016
Go back on it to them

2362
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:16,832
It's almost like

2363
01:58:17,344 --> 01:58:19,392
Committed you know like right in their life

2364
01:58:19,648 --> 01:58:21,184
Well we've already put all of our chips

2365
01:58:22,208 --> 01:58:23,744
Why would we stop now

2366
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:25,024
A pic because birthday

2367
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:27,840
It's money protecting Bad Bunny artist

2368
01:58:28,864 --> 01:58:33,216
Because I hate cuz I worked here 10 years and also

2369
01:58:34,496 --> 01:58:37,568
I-4 so many of these people even if my parents

2370
01:58:37,824 --> 01:58:38,592
Even if my mom and dad

Who been with this church

2372
01:58:40,896 --> 01:58:41,920
Even if they know

2373
01:58:42,432 --> 01:58:42,944
It's b*******

2374
01:58:43,968 --> 01:58:44,992
If they leave it

2375
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:46,528
Now they don't have any

2376
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:49,344
That stuff now what

2377
01:58:52,928 --> 01:58:53,440
You got nothing

2378
01:58:57,280 --> 01:59:02,400
Let all of that but I'm really not about

2379
01:59:02,912 --> 01:59:06,240
Yeah it's a Prosperity Gospel but I don't really worry about

2380
01:59:06,496 --> 01:59:07,520
Rivermark

2381
01:59:08,032 --> 01:59:08,544
I'm just

2382
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:11,104
I'm just doing that for the for the Godlike

2383
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:11,872
Of course

2384
01:59:12,128 --> 01:59:12,640
I get it

2385
01:59:13,408 --> 01:59:14,176
Itsjustjord

2386
01:59:14,688 --> 01:59:15,200
F******

2387
01:59:15,456 --> 01:59:16,224
You're ruining it

2388
01:59:18,528 --> 01:59:19,808
DePaul are people like a gym

2389
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:21,344
Much deeper

2390
01:59:23,904 --> 01:59:24,928
Things that they want

2391
01:59:26,208 --> 01:59:26,720
They have

2392
01:59:27,232 --> 01:59:27,744
Issues

2393
01:59:28,512 --> 01:59:29,024
They care about

2394
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:30,048
That are not

2395
01:59:31,328 --> 01:59:32,352
About being religiously

2396
01:59:33,632 --> 01:59:34,656
Like that

2397
01:59:34,912 --> 01:59:35,936
The reason

2398
01:59:36,192 --> 01:59:36,960
Jim almost

2399
01:59:37,216 --> 01:59:38,752
Jesus on himself with that tent

2400
01:59:40,032 --> 01:59:40,800
Stripping of the John's

2401
01:59:41,056 --> 01:59:42,336
What's an amendment

2402
01:59:42,592 --> 01:59:44,384
Is because when he cares about

2403
01:59:44,640 --> 01:59:45,152
Is using

2404
01:59:45,408 --> 01:59:45,920
The church

2405
01:59:46,432 --> 01:59:46,944
But he has

2406
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:48,480
In a political way

2407
01:59:48,736 --> 01:59:49,760
Because

2408
01:59:50,016 --> 01:59:50,528

So many more vistas of fundraiser

01:59:53,088 --> 01:59:54,112
There's so many more things

2411
01:59:54,368 --> 01:59:55,136
Able to

2412
01:59:55,392 --> 01:59:57,696
To do in a tax-free environment

2413
01:59:58,208 --> 02:00:00,512
If you able to not have the

Thank God for

2419
02:00:10,240 --> 02:00:11,776
The crimes that I committed

2420
02:00:12,288 --> 02:00:13,824
For legal now

2443
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:09,120
About once a month or so with a check

2444
02:01:09,376 --> 02:01:10,400
Checkbook and be like yeah

2445
02:01:11,424 --> 02:01:12,192
A cup

2446
02:01:13,216 --> 02:01:13,728
Really

2447
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:16,800
Cool and fun

2448
02:01:17,056 --> 02:01:20,384
Very exciting to see trash

2449
02:01:22,432 --> 02:01:24,992
No cuz he wasn't it

2450
02:01:27,808 --> 02:01:29,344
Around my last day working

2451
02:01:30,112 --> 02:01:30,624
My second

2452
02:01:35,488 --> 02:01:36,512
Is that coffee shop

2453
02:01:36,768 --> 02:01:38,048
I still have it I thought it was really

2454
02:01:38,304 --> 02:01:38,816
I thought it was really sweet

2455
02:01:39,072 --> 02:01:39,584
Sweet very nice

2456
02:01:49,056 --> 02:01:49,568
Aw

2457
02:01:49,824 --> 02:01:50,848
Where is iff

2458
02:01:52,384 --> 02:01:53,152
Like Donald Trump

2459
02:01:53,408 --> 02:01:54,432
Signed bill with it

2460
02:01:54,944 --> 02:01:56,224
And I know it doesn't mean anything

2461
02:01:56,480 --> 02:01:59,296
What is a Sentimental artifact of my time or whatever

2462
02:01:59,552 --> 02:02:01,344
I respect that more than

2463
02:02:01,856 --> 02:02:02,624
Jim Bakker being like

2464
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:05,696
I've waited my whole life for this then

2465
02:02:06,208 --> 02:02:07,232
That's very different

2466
02:02:08,512 --> 02:02:10,048
That is very good talk

2467
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:12,352
Nicholas gets a historical revision

2468
02:02:13,632 --> 02:02:15,936
A reminder by American

2469
02:02:16,448 --> 02:02:18,240
What's the purpose of America

2470
02:02:18,496 --> 02:02:24,640
What was the purpose for us

2471
02:02:24,896 --> 02:02:31,040
Forefathers came over

2472
02:02:37,696 --> 02:02:43,840
Which they did not last night

2473
02:02:44,096 --> 02:02:44,608
Lighthouse

2474
02:02:44,864 --> 02:02:51,008
Murdered all of the people

2475
02:02:51,264 --> 02:02:55,104
What's up blood everyone restaurant

2476
02:02:55,616 --> 02:02:56,128
The sacrament

2477
02:02:59,968 --> 02:03:00,736
Nevada side I don't

2478
02:03:03,296 --> 02:03:07,136
This will be a Christian weigh station on the way to other places

2479
02:03:09,952 --> 02:03:12,000
Ivan I think that what we have there

2480
02:03:12,256 --> 02:03:13,792
More importantly whether or not that

2481
02:03:14,304 --> 02:03:14,816
Blatant

2482
02:03:15,072 --> 02:03:15,840
Historical revisionism

2483
02:03:16,096 --> 02:03:16,608
Them or not

2484
02:03:16,864 --> 02:03:18,400
There is

2485
02:03:18,656 --> 02:03:19,424
Absolutely

2486
02:03:19,680 --> 02:03:20,960
Declaration

2487
02:03:23,264 --> 02:03:26,080
Yep we want this to be and we believe that

2488
02:03:26,336 --> 02:03:27,360
It was supposed to be

2489
02:03:27,872 --> 02:03:28,640
I need to know.

2490
02:03:29,152 --> 02:03:29,664
Because of these

2491
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:30,432
Demon flow

2492
02:03:31,200 --> 02:03:31,968
Who are you and I

2493
02:03:37,600 --> 02:03:38,112
I mean

2494
02:03:40,928 --> 02:03:41,696
Because

2495
02:03:42,208 --> 02:03:43,232
Here's what you're doing

2496
02:03:44,256 --> 02:03:46,304
I mean

2497
02:03:47,072 --> 02:03:47,840
Your

2498
02:03:48,096 --> 02:03:50,400
Taking everything that Humanity has ever done

2499
02:03:51,680 --> 02:03:52,960
Going like

2500
02:03:53,216 --> 02:03:54,496
No that doesn't

2501
02:03:55,264 --> 02:03:56,800
And that really doesn't support by our

2502
02:03:57,824 --> 02:03:59,616
So I'm going to make my own up

2503
02:04:00,384 --> 02:04:01,920
Human history

2504
02:04:02,176 --> 02:04:03,456
Supports what I want to do

2505
02:04:03,968 --> 02:04:05,760
So let's just make that the real

2506
02:04:06,016 --> 02:04:06,528
Okay

2507
02:04:06,784 --> 02:04:07,552
What God makes perfect

2508
02:04:08,832 --> 02:04:10,112
What if I just convinced enough

2509
02:04:10,368 --> 02:04:11,648
People that realities

2510
02:04:13,952 --> 02:04:14,464
To do

2511
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:16,512
Good at it

2512
02:04:19,584 --> 02:04:23,936
Private conversation I feel like I keep having this conversation more and more

2513
02:04:25,472 --> 02:04:26,752
Recently than I think I ever had

2514
02:04:27,008 --> 02:04:27,520
At before which

2515
02:04:27,776 --> 02:04:28,288
She's just like

2516
02:04:28,544 --> 02:04:29,312
What we've always

2517
02:04:30,848 --> 02:04:31,872
Talked about witches like

2518
02:04:32,384 --> 02:04:34,944
A conversation doesn't happen until there's an agreement of

2519
02:04:35,200 --> 02:04:36,992
Terms and agreement of definition

2520
02:04:37,504 --> 02:04:39,040
Classic what is

2521
02:04:39,296 --> 02:04:41,088
When you say table

2522
02:04:41,344 --> 02:04:42,880
Are we talkin about table

2523
02:04:43,392 --> 02:04:45,696
And we are no longer doing that

2524
02:04:45,952 --> 02:04:46,464
You can't happen with

2525
02:04:46,720 --> 02:04:50,048
There is a conversation to be had with somebody who believes

2526
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:52,864
That the founding fathers wanted a Christian

2527
02:04:53,120 --> 02:04:59,264
Percy what is your you believe that guy

2528
02:05:02,592 --> 02:05:05,408
What are you saying about well here's a good concrete example

2529
02:05:06,432 --> 02:05:06,944
If you look at

2530
02:05:07,712 --> 02:05:08,224
The reality of

2531
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:10,272
Korea

2532
02:05:13,088 --> 02:05:13,600
Bob made

2533
02:05:16,416 --> 02:05:17,952
Has to be one of the most

2534
02:05:18,464 --> 02:05:18,976
Hilarious

2535
02:05:19,488 --> 02:05:22,304
They are rubbing their asses at our faces

2536
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:23,072
And I think it's a

2537
02:05:23,584 --> 02:05:25,888
But we get back to this idea of

2538
02:05:26,144 --> 02:05:27,168
The beginning of a conversation

2539
02:05:27,424 --> 02:05:27,936
Is the definition of

2540
02:05:28,192 --> 02:05:28,704
Terms

2541
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:29,984
And you have

2542
02:05:30,496 --> 02:05:31,776
Denuclearization

2543
02:05:32,288 --> 02:05:33,312
Is being a term

2544
02:05:33,568 --> 02:05:34,848
That has been agreed on

2545
02:05:35,104 --> 02:05:35,616
In this

2546
02:05:36,128 --> 02:05:37,408
Statements

2547
02:05:40,224 --> 02:05:40,736
Trump

2548
02:05:41,248 --> 02:05:42,016
Denuclearization

2549
02:05:42,272 --> 02:05:43,552
Is a one-sided

2550
02:05:43,808 --> 02:05:46,624
Saying where he gives up all of his nukes

2551
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:47,392
And submit

2552
02:05:47,648 --> 02:05:48,160
Where is for

2553
02:05:48,416 --> 02:05:50,208
Jim the term denuclearization

2554
02:05:50,464 --> 02:05:50,976
Is a

2555
02:05:52,256 --> 02:05:53,536
The Unova takamori

2556
02:05:53,792 --> 02:05:57,632
Unilateral thing where is South Korea gives up their weapons

2557
02:05:58,144 --> 02:05:59,424
The entire Peninsula big

2558
02:05:59,936 --> 02:06:00,448
The weaponized

2559
02:06:00,704 --> 02:06:01,216
Is the United States

2560
02:06:01,472 --> 02:06:01,984
Scales back

2561
02:06:02,496 --> 02:06:03,264
Involvement

2562
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:04,288
And stuff like that

2563
02:06:04,544 --> 02:06:05,312
Come to an agreement

2564
02:06:05,568 --> 02:06:07,872
We believe in

2565
02:06:08,128 --> 02:06:10,944
But if it means accent

2566
02:06:11,200 --> 02:06:11,968
Then you don't have any

2567
02:06:14,528 --> 02:06:16,064
It's not real

2568
02:06:16,320 --> 02:06:16,832
Converse

2569
02:06:18,624 --> 02:06:19,136
The conversation

2570
02:06:19,648 --> 02:06:20,160
Keep having its

2571
02:06:20,416 --> 02:06:21,184
The reason why bad

2572
02:06:21,696 --> 02:06:22,464
Actors like

2573
02:06:22,720 --> 02:06:23,232
Alex Jones

2574
02:06:25,280 --> 02:06:25,792
Commentators on

2575
02:06:28,352 --> 02:06:29,120
Such a big problem

2576
02:06:29,888 --> 02:06:30,912
They don't have a consent

2577
02:06:34,240 --> 02:06:35,776
And that is because

2578
02:06:36,032 --> 02:06:37,312
Can't have the conversation

2579
02:06:37,568 --> 02:06:38,336
On like

2580
02:06:38,592 --> 02:06:39,616
Level plane

2581
02:06:40,896 --> 02:06:44,992
Because weight doesn't make any sense because when you nail things down people can't

2582
02:06:47,040 --> 02:06:47,808
Getaround

2583
02:06:48,064 --> 02:06:48,832
You can't be like

2584
02:06:49,344 --> 02:06:50,624
What what do you believe

2585
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:51,392
Leaving

2586
02:06:51,648 --> 02:06:53,696
Make it hard Declaration of what you believe

2587
02:06:54,208 --> 02:06:56,768
Well and this is how this is how everybody

2588
02:06:57,024 --> 02:06:57,536
5

2589
02:06:57,792 --> 02:07:00,352
Absolutely and it's something that we all

2590
02:07:00,608 --> 02:07:02,400
I think it's one of the big things

2591
02:07:02,656 --> 02:07:03,936
As far as growing it's like

2592
02:07:04,192 --> 02:07:05,216
Getting over this

2593
02:07:05,728 --> 02:07:07,264
Is when you are talking to some

2594
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:08,544
When you're having an argument

2595
02:07:09,056 --> 02:07:09,824
And they start

2596
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:10,592
To pin you down

2597
02:07:11,360 --> 02:07:11,872
You start

2598
02:07:12,128 --> 02:07:12,640
To feel it though

2599
02:07:13,408 --> 02:07:16,224
Like there's a certain point where you start to feel like

2600
02:07:16,992 --> 02:07:17,504
I might

2601
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:18,528
I might be wrong

2602
02:07:19,552 --> 02:07:20,576
And instead of

2603
02:07:20,832 --> 02:07:21,600
4

2604
02:07:21,856 --> 02:07:22,368
What like this

2605
02:07:22,624 --> 02:07:24,416
Humanity like 95% of us

2606
02:07:24,672 --> 02:07:25,440
Instead of saying like

2607
02:07:26,464 --> 02:07:27,232
Oh no that

2608
02:07:27,488 --> 02:07:29,024
Okay tell me more about that

2609
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:29,792
You're like

2610
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:31,840
Well

2611
02:07:32,096 --> 02:07:33,888
Bright

2612
02:07:34,144 --> 02:07:35,424
And Dismount fast exact

2613
02:07:35,936 --> 02:07:37,472
No I wasn't staying.

2614
02:07:37,984 --> 02:07:41,568
And believing the same s*** that you

2615
02:07:41,824 --> 02:07:42,848
For a brief stint

2616
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:44,128
You have that chance U

2617
02:07:44,384 --> 02:07:45,664
You have that moment of like

2618
02:07:46,176 --> 02:07:47,712
Maybe I could be wrong

2619
02:07:48,480 --> 02:07:49,504
And I could say I'm wrong

2620
02:07:49,760 --> 02:07:50,272
And then I could

2621
02:07:52,832 --> 02:07:53,856
Two things that I do and

2622
02:07:55,904 --> 02:07:56,928
Robbie the first thing is

2623
02:07:57,184 --> 02:07:57,952
Universal

2624
02:07:58,720 --> 02:07:59,232
Assassin

2625
02:07:59,744 --> 02:08:00,512
Then the second thing is

2626
02:08:00,768 --> 02:08:02,304
Either

2627
02:08:02,560 --> 02:08:03,584
Did this conversation

2628
02:08:04,096 --> 02:08:04,864
Yeah

2629
02:08:09,216 --> 02:08:11,776
If you're wrong about something you're wrong about

2630
02:08:12,544 --> 02:08:13,824
Worst thing in the world

2631
02:08:14,080 --> 02:08:15,616
Fun things that

2632
02:08:15,872 --> 02:08:16,896
I have experience with this

2633
02:08:17,152 --> 02:08:19,456
With our old

2634
02:08:20,224 --> 02:08:20,992
Eventually

2635
02:08:26,112 --> 02:08:27,392
You're right

2636
02:08:27,648 --> 02:08:31,744
I said was dumb because it was based on information that I didn't really have

2637
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:32,512
And you have that

2638
02:08:34,816 --> 02:08:35,328
Like your reason

2639
02:08:41,216 --> 02:08:42,752
Growth

2640
02:08:43,008 --> 02:08:45,824
Excited to do this talk about

2641
02:08:46,080 --> 02:08:47,104
Boring for Alec

2642
02:08:47,872 --> 02:08:49,152
Can you sell this stuff

2643
02:08:49,408 --> 02:08:51,712
For me it's really exciting because I

2644
02:08:52,224 --> 02:08:52,736
Like

2645
02:08:52,992 --> 02:08:54,272
Not being wrong

2646
02:08:54,784 --> 02:08:55,808
And when I'm wrong

2647
02:08:56,320 --> 02:09:00,160
That's just a super exciting opportunity to be wrong later

2648
02:09:00,416 --> 02:09:00,928
You know

2649
02:09:01,184 --> 02:09:01,696
Luggage

2650
02:09:01,952 --> 02:09:02,720
Great I like

2651
02:09:02,976 --> 02:09:03,744
Learning ship

2652
02:09:04,256 --> 02:09:05,792
And so often like what these

2653
02:09:06,048 --> 02:09:06,816
You could

2654
02:09:07,072 --> 02:09:07,584
Tell them

2655
02:09:07,840 --> 02:09:10,400
You couldn't get any you you could rhetorically have an

2656
02:09:10,656 --> 02:09:11,168
Where they're like

2657
02:09:11,680 --> 02:09:14,496
But maybe your butt and you just keep him down just like

2658
02:09:14,752 --> 02:09:15,264
Stay in the pocket

2659
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:16,800
This is what we're talking about

2660
02:09:17,056 --> 02:09:17,568
This is

2661
02:09:18,848 --> 02:09:24,992
You are staying right here with me until you and I agree that this is

2662
02:09:26,016 --> 02:09:27,040
Talking about we are not

2663
02:09:27,296 --> 02:09:30,624
Talking but this is why philosophers don't go on Infowars

2664
02:09:31,904 --> 02:09:33,184
This is why people who are actual

2665
02:09:33,440 --> 02:09:34,720
Really good at like God

2666
02:09:35,744 --> 02:09:36,256
Conversation

2667
02:09:36,768 --> 02:09:39,328
Not in that sense don't go on these shows

2668
02:09:39,584 --> 02:09:40,096
Because

2669
02:09:40,608 --> 02:09:41,120
Stupid

2670
02:09:41,376 --> 02:09:42,912
Think that's also one of the problem

2671
02:09:43,168 --> 02:09:48,800
Is that why do these philosophers today

2672
02:09:49,056 --> 02:09:51,616
I'm sorry about it

2673
02:09:51,872 --> 02:09:56,480
At regard

2674
02:09:58,784 --> 02:10:01,856
No I know I understood the impliedly

2675
02:10:02,112 --> 02:10:02,880
You're making butter

2676
02:10:03,136 --> 02:10:03,648
The same time

2677
02:10:03,904 --> 02:10:04,928
Just on its face

2678
02:10:07,232 --> 02:10:07,744
No

2679
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:12,096
Why won't it like it is a problem that smarter people don't go on these shows

2680
02:10:12,352 --> 02:10:17,984
Yes no that's not what I'm talking about and yes it is a problem

2681
02:10:19,008 --> 02:10:19,520
Do you know

2682
02:10:22,336 --> 02:10:24,128
This will never get better

2683
02:10:24,384 --> 02:10:25,408
If these worlds

2684
02:10:25,920 --> 02:10:27,968
What it is is this

2685
02:10:28,736 --> 02:10:30,016
Is is a

2686
02:10:30,272 --> 02:10:31,296
Infected tooth

2687
02:10:31,808 --> 02:10:32,576
Jim Bakker

2688
02:10:32,832 --> 02:10:34,624
Alex Jones is another insect

2689
02:10:35,392 --> 02:10:36,928
It's not going to get better in

2690
02:10:37,184 --> 02:10:37,696
Until you put

2691
02:10:38,208 --> 02:10:38,720
Medication

2692
02:10:38,976 --> 02:10:40,512
Root canal

2693
02:10:41,024 --> 02:10:42,816
Root canal is probably

2694
02:10:43,328 --> 02:10:48,448
Smart people showing up and embarrassing them on their own shadow or something like that

2695
02:10:48,704 --> 02:10:49,728
B ukulele

2696
02:10:50,240 --> 02:10:51,776
Right but I think that

2697
02:10:52,288 --> 02:10:52,800
Where

2698
02:10:53,056 --> 02:10:53,824
One of the Big Dipper

2699
02:10:54,080 --> 02:10:54,592
Connect happen

2700
02:10:54,848 --> 02:10:56,384
And also as we've seen

2701
02:10:56,640 --> 02:10:59,968
Like dr.

2702
02:11:00,224 --> 02:11:06,368
So people go on and they do a root canal and the behavior of eating candy all night happens again and that you have

2703
02:11:06,624 --> 02:11:10,464
Have another

2704
02:11:15,072 --> 02:11:15,840
It is

2705
02:11:16,608 --> 02:11:17,632
DeWitt the way that you

2706
02:11:17,888 --> 02:11:18,656
You put it is what trade

2707
02:11:19,168 --> 02:11:19,680
Triggered it for me

2708
02:11:20,192 --> 02:11:20,704
When you said

2709
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:23,008
Well it's that people who are good at this

2710
02:11:23,264 --> 02:11:24,544
This kind of thing don't go on there

2711
02:11:25,056 --> 02:11:26,848
And that's the way people viewed

2712
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:27,872
You're not

2713
02:11:28,128 --> 02:11:28,896
You're not right

2714
02:11:29,664 --> 02:11:30,176
You're just

2715
02:11:30,432 --> 02:11:31,456
Better at arguing

2716
02:11:33,248 --> 02:11:34,016
It's really good at arguing

2717
02:11:34,528 --> 02:11:39,392
Right but not really but that's the way that people get out of being in that conversation with

2718
02:11:39,904 --> 02:11:41,184
I've had this happen to me plenty

2719
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:46,304
Tons of them but they're just

2720
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:47,584
Right

2721
02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:50,144
But if I never have it

2722
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:51,424
But if their argument

2723
02:11:51,680 --> 02:11:52,192
Is losing

2724
02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:54,240
They will say it is not because

2725
02:11:54,496 --> 02:11:55,008
Has their argument

2726
02:11:56,032 --> 02:11:57,056
Or is because their argument

2727
02:11:57,312 --> 02:11:57,824
Doesn't make any

2728
02:11:58,592 --> 02:11:59,360
The states because

2729
02:11:59,872 --> 02:12:01,664
You're just better at arguing

2730
02:12:02,688 --> 02:12:04,736
Oh

2731
02:12:04,992 --> 02:12:07,296
Who is Dominic

2732
02:12:07,552 --> 02:12:09,088
Whether or not you

He is making

So many people British

Fears about sending their kids to play

Steve Angelica

2737
02:12:26,496 --> 02:12:27,008
This is like

2738
02:12:29,824 --> 02:12:30,592
You're going to think

2739
02:12:31,360 --> 02:12:32,640
Did they have knowledge that

2740
02:12:35,200 --> 02:12:37,248
Is there just tricking you with better argh

2741
02:12:38,016 --> 02:12:40,832
Because we don't know how to

2742
02:12:41,088 --> 02:12:46,720
God says don't argue or sneaky highfalutin City learning Toledo

Bedford

2744
02:12:51,328 --> 02:12:52,608
It is about a

2745
02:12:52,864 --> 02:12:54,144
Quality of argument

2746
02:12:54,656 --> 02:12:55,424
Being

2747
02:12:55,680 --> 02:12:57,472
As opposed to

Affect

2749

The end of the day

2750
02:13:03,104 --> 02:13:03,616
I really don't

2751
02:13:03,872 --> 02:13:04,384
Ticket matters

2752
02:13:04,640 --> 02:13:06,432
Because all these things that we're

Pic-a-lilli cancer

2754
02:13:07,456 --> 02:13:07,968
What about these

2755
02:13:08,480 --> 02:13:08,992
Issues

2756
02:13:09,248 --> 02:13:10,016
We've brought up here

Agreement

2760
02:13:15,904 --> 02:13:16,416
These are two things

2761
02:13:16,672 --> 02:13:18,208
Things that are really important having a

2762
02:13:19,232 --> 02:13:19,744
Matter with you

2763
02:13:20,256 --> 02:13:21,792
Because there's one thing that this is about

2764
02:13:26,400 --> 02:13:26,912
You

2771
02:13:45,856 --> 02:13:46,880
About that

2772
02:13:47,392 --> 02:13:51,232
Doesn't matter

It's their spiritual assassin

2776
02:14:04,288 --> 02:14:07,360
But you know what I did John and I grabbed each other the other night

2777
02:14:07,872 --> 02:14:09,408
We put our speed and oil

2778
02:14:09,664 --> 02:14:13,504
We started taking communion like this prophetic

2779
02:14:18,112 --> 02:14:19,904
We took the mountain.

2780
02:14:20,160 --> 02:14:20,928
Who does the song

2781
02:14:21,184 --> 02:14:24,768
Because you said it would be for the preservation of our life

2782
02:14:25,024 --> 02:14:26,816

You need to get thousands of dollars and obedience

2785
02:14:36,288 --> 02:14:42,432
For the word of the Lord that is coming because it's going to preserve you and your family

2786
02:14:42,688 --> 02:14:43,200
How I pray

2787
02:14:43,712 --> 02:14:46,272
I didn't pray tell God will you just keep

2789
02:14:50,624 --> 02:14:52,672
No

2790
02:14:53,184 --> 02:14:53,696
Just

2791
02:14:53,952 --> 02:14:57,280
Describe your trying to make the metaphorical literal

2792

02:14:58,560 --> 02:15:00,096
Her and her husband

Who controls Oliver refuses to allow her to

2795
02:15:07,008 --> 02:15:07,776
South of course she is

2796
02:15:08,032 --> 02:15:09,568
Subservient to him in every apostle

2797
02:15:11,104 --> 02:15:12,384
They were told by God

2798
02:15:12,896 --> 02:15:13,920
To sew somebody

2799
02:15:14,432 --> 02:15:14,944
Into place

2800
02:15:15,200 --> 02:15:16,992
Known for their children

2801
02:15:17,248 --> 02:15:21,088
You are selling your misspelling the word

Throwing Steve

2805
02:15:25,952 --> 02:15:29,536
This is just the basics

2806
02:15:29,792 --> 02:15:30,304
No this is

2807
02:15:30,560 --> 02:15:31,584
The basis of

2808
02:15:32,864 --> 02:15:33,376
Prosperity Gospel

2809
02:15:34,144 --> 02:15:35,424
We talked about this over and over again

2810
02:15:37,472 --> 02:15:37,984
What I hear

2811
02:15:38,240 --> 02:15:38,752
Where is

2812
02:15:39,520 --> 02:15:40,288
I'm going to lie

2813
02:15:43,872 --> 02:15:44,896
That have communion

2814
02:15:45,152 --> 02:15:45,664

They took a bath together and drink

2816
02:15:52,320 --> 02:15:53,088
Is wonderful

2817
02:15:53,344 --> 02:15:55,392
But the idea of her selling this

2818
02:15:55,648 --> 02:15:57,440
Either whatever what she's talking about is I made

2819
02:15:58,208 --> 02:15:58,976
And now I'm trying

2820
02:15:59,488 --> 02:16:00,000
Reply

2821
02:16:00,256 --> 02:16:02,816
You need to do the same thing but with

2822
02:16:03,328 --> 02:16:05,120
Jamaican investment in me

2823
02:16:06,656 --> 02:16:07,168
No course

2824
02:16:12,288 --> 02:16:14,592
I bet I do bet they have like a safe

2825
02:16:16,384 --> 02:16:16,896
Dewey's

2826
02:16:17,152 --> 02:16:17,664
Detox

2827
02:16:17,920 --> 02:16:18,944
Never exist without a grain

2828
02:16:19,200 --> 02:16:25,344
Paranoia somewhere

2829
02:16:25,600 --> 02:16:28,416
Was a metaphor that was also a very real story

2830
02:16:28,672 --> 02:16:30,720
About discussion that they had

2831
02:16:30,976 --> 02:16:31,488
Bio-Oil on there

2832
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:33,792
Something I mean like

2833
02:16:34,048 --> 02:16:37,120
For real that does sound like her dramatizing a

2834
02:16:37,632 --> 02:16:41,472
Like we took a foot bath

2835
02:16:42,752 --> 02:16:43,264
It's not like

2836
02:16:44,032 --> 02:16:45,312
It's not like God told us to

2837
02:16:45,568 --> 02:16:47,104
Giveaway

2838
02:16:47,872 --> 02:16:49,920
Recognizable amount of our Fortune

2839
02:16:50,432 --> 02:16:51,456
Not that

2840
02:16:51,968 --> 02:16:54,784
I don't believe that for a hot second

2841
02:16:55,040 --> 02:16:57,856
But she wants to fight it is in order to make it

2842
02:16:58,368 --> 02:16:58,880
Like you have to go

2843
02:16:59,136 --> 02:17:02,464
Give more is that

2844
02:17:03,744 --> 02:17:04,256
Like again

2845
02:17:04,768 --> 02:17:05,792
For all of our intent

2846
02:17:06,560 --> 02:17:07,328
And our pretenses of

2847
02:17:07,584 --> 02:17:08,864
So trying to have a real conversation

2848
02:17:09,120 --> 02:17:10,400
In about what these people are up to

2849
02:17:10,912 --> 02:17:12,704
It always boils down to

2850
02:17:12,960 --> 02:17:13,472
Do this.

2851
02:17:13,728 --> 02:17:18,336
Yeah always boils down over and over $45

2852
02:17:23,456 --> 02:17:24,224
10%

2853
02:17:24,736 --> 02:17:25,248
Of everything

2854
02:17:26,784 --> 02:17:27,552
Because I have this magic

2855
02:17:28,576 --> 02:17:29,856
And I primed with our God

2856
02:17:30,112 --> 02:17:31,136
King

2857
02:17:31,392 --> 02:17:31,904
Who is the

2858
02:17:34,208 --> 02:17:34,976
Amanda

2859
02:17:35,232 --> 02:17:36,000
Sort of behavior

2860
02:17:37,792 --> 02:17:38,560
Down the road

2861
02:17:39,328 --> 02:17:39,840
A growth

2862
02:17:41,376 --> 02:17:42,400
Really feel like

2863
02:17:42,912 --> 02:17:44,960
America was founded on lyca

2864
02:17:47,008 --> 02:17:48,544
Man there was something about

2865
02:17:49,312 --> 02:17:51,104
I remember when America was

2866
02:17:51,616 --> 02:17:52,128
Started

2867
02:17:52,640 --> 02:17:57,760
They were like

2868
02:17:58,016 --> 02:18:00,064
Songs off of empire real

2869
02:18:00,576 --> 02:18:01,344
Oh yeah

2870
02:18:02,880 --> 02:18:04,672
You know everyone knows Reelin in the Years

2871
02:18:05,184 --> 02:18:06,720
S*** like that but

2872
02:18:06,976 --> 02:18:09,024
Uncle King

2873
02:18:10,816 --> 02:18:11,328
Kings

2874
02:18:16,448 --> 02:18:17,472
Battle simulator album

2875
02:18:19,520 --> 02:18:21,056
But

2876
02:18:21,312 --> 02:18:21,824
Cancel

2877
02:18:22,336 --> 02:18:22,848
We seen

2878
02:18:24,128 --> 02:18:25,664
A good King Richard

2879
02:18:26,176 --> 02:18:27,200
Right raise up

2880
02:18:27,456 --> 02:18:28,224
Your Glass

2881
02:18:30,272 --> 02:18:35,904
Mark Wahlberg

2882
02:18:36,160 --> 02:18:36,672
Classic

2883
02:18:37,184 --> 02:18:38,464
Three Kings

2884
02:18:38,720 --> 02:18:39,488
Steely Dan's version

2885
02:18:39,744 --> 02:18:42,048
Kings was really all about the

2886
02:18:42,304 --> 02:18:43,584
Fall of Richard Nixon

2887
02:18:45,376 --> 02:18:45,888
JFK

2888
02:18:46,144 --> 02:18:47,168
So is the movie Three Kings

2889
02:18:47,424 --> 02:18:47,936
Wow

2890
02:18:48,192 --> 02:18:48,704
Absolutely

2891
02:18:53,568 --> 02:18:54,592
I got to go

2892
02:18:56,128 --> 02:18:57,920
I want to talk more about Steve

2893
02:18:58,432 --> 02:19:03,296
787 Raptors up band midnight Cruiser off at

2894
02:19:03,552 --> 02:19:06,368
Turning into a middle-aged man in front of

2895
02:19:06,880 --> 02:19:13,024
I like that now my new thing is going to be like musically

2896
02:19:13,280 --> 02:19:14,560
Last time I feel like

2897
02:19:14,816 --> 02:19:16,096
20 year old girls

2898
02:19:16,352 --> 02:19:19,936
Cornered by a man talking about Steely Dan which is not an uncommon feeling

2899
02:19:22,240 --> 02:19:23,264
I already said midnight Cruiser

2900
02:19:23,776 --> 02:19:24,544
I can't think of a third song

2901
02:19:29,152 --> 02:19:30,944
It's great and Hulu good time

2902
02:19:34,784 --> 02:19:35,296
Let me get it

2903
02:19:35,552 --> 02:19:36,832
The parallels are very clear in

2904
02:19:39,136 --> 02:19:40,416
Work is more important than

2905
02:19:40,672 --> 02:19:41,952
I need the actual content

2906
02:19:42,464 --> 02:19:43,744

2907
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:45,792

A lot of a very credible musician

Some of them have

2937
02:20:51,328 --> 02:20:52,608
I don't know

2938
02:20:52,864 --> 02:20:54,144
Probably speaking
