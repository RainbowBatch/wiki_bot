Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan
I love your work
Knowledgefight
N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight.com
I love you
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledgefight, I'm Dan
I'm Jordan
We're a couple dudes, I like to sit around, worship at the altar of Selene
and talk a little bit about Alex Jones
Oh, indeed we are, Dan
Jordan, Jordan
Quick question for you
What's up?
What's your bright spot today, buddy?
My bright spot today, Jordan, is I'm a little bit late to this
but there's a new season of Survivor that has started
Oh, whoa, whoa
And so I've been watching that a little bit
and, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
One of the worst casts I've ever seen in my life
Oh, really? Is it a bad one?
I thought three people at least were gonna die in the first week
Oh, no
Like people who had no business being
Oh, so not like reality annoying characters, like
they're bad at survival-ing characters
I think that I found them somewhat grading
Grading? Well, that'll happen
A number of the people who were on this season
I didn't, I couldn't find any real, like, shining, like
ah, I'm excited to see how this plays out
There was just a bunch of people, I'm like
I think you're all gonna quit
And then in the first episode, one of them did quit
And, uh, I just, I don't know
It's strange, it's strange because
I think that I've been spoiled a little bit
when it comes to these kinds of competition shows by The Challenge
Sure
Because they compete
Like, say what you want about that show
They go hard
Yeah, they have really figured out a way to get those people
to just really act, just in insane ways
And all of the people are, you know, for the most part
physical specimens
Totally
You know, they spend a lot of time working out
and are in peak, like, optimal fuck around game conditions
And in a space where you're like
it is a good thing you have The Challenge
because there's no other reason in your life for you to ever be this fit
Yeah
What are you doing?
Meanwhile, on Survivor, you have people from all walks of life
Sure
And so, like, sometimes watching them try to do these competitions is like
I can't watch this
Just, who's better at starving today?
Yeah
And, uh, I don't know
It's a very strange thing because there is a two-pronged thing
I've always liked to see people outside and trying to survive
Sure
That's nice
It's an interesting thing
And I'll enjoy Survivor
Like, I'll go ahead and continue watching it until it goes away
Sure, sure
I've already invested this deeply
What am I gonna do?
Yeah
But it is a little bit dull
Yeah
And when the characters aren't doing it for you, holy shit
It's tough
It's tough
It's hard to suddenly just be like
Oh, I don't think I can
You know what?
And I'm gonna throw this out there
I'm done with people baking
I just don't give a shit anymore
There's only so much you can bake
I hit the point
I think I would still be interested
In the Great British Bake Off
But just because it's so calming
I think, you know what?
I think that's what happened
It makes me angry now
That I can't find it calming
I don't find it calming
It's like me and reggae
Like, you're all trying to be calming
When you all know that you're not
It's like there's a second layer
Everybody's aware of what it is that they are
They're trying to, like, keep the formula
While not, like, oh, I fucking hate them all
I think you ruined things by branching out into, like, that great pottery show
The pottery shit, didn't it?
And all those other ones
It's not too far afield
As possible
If you would have just stayed with the baking
I think you'd be okay
Sure, sure
Um, but yeah
Is this, did we just explain Mormon?
Uh, not Mormon, oh shit, nevermind
Amish, yeah, fuck, fuck me
Alright
Well, Amish are just out there trying to survive too
Much like the people on Survivor
Yeah
Bringing it back around
Rumspring a thing, yeah, yeah, okay, nevermind
Um, so yeah, I, I don't know
I'm really not looking forward to this season
But I'm gonna watch it
Oh well
I believe you
Yep
What's your brain spot?
Wait, no, I forgot
I had a thought that I lost, but it's this
Last season, there was this guy named Bruce
Who seemed like a very charismatic, forties-ish kind of guy
Sure
And he hit his head on something in the first episode
Yeah
And he was just bleeding from the face
Jesus
And he ended up, like, having to be Medivac from the show
Right
Because he had, like, a severe concussion
Yeah
I think, as I recall, I haven't watched that season since it came out
But I remember he was, like, muttering stuff
And people were like, I think you need help
Oh, is he back?
He got a chance to come back on this next season
Yeah
And it's so weird, because, like, people have been Medivac before
And they don't necessarily get another shot the next season
Sure
So it's strange that he's being afforded that
And then it also just creates this bizarre dynamic between everybody
Because they've watched that season
And they're aware that this guy knocked himself out
And got another chance
And so they're treating him like he's not just another person who's on the show
But at the same time he is
It's fucking weird
Yeah, that is strange
It's not fair to him, I think
That is strange
It's not fair to anybody
Yeah
Anyway, I'm not interested in the dynamic
Nah
What's your bright spot?
My bright spot is, uh, Dan, I can see
I can see using my eyes, I got new glasses
This was your bright spot in one of our live shows
No, it was my bright spot because I had contacts
That's true
I finally got a new pair of glasses that replaced my lost pair of glasses
Yeah, and they're kind of green
They're kind of green
I like them, I like them a lot
When they're not on my eyes I can't see them
Yeah, and that was why you couldn't tell that they were kind of green
Well, they told me they were kind of green
Yeah
So I assumed
And then it wasn't until later that I realized that I wouldn't be able to tell
So I asked you
Yeah, and I can confirm they're a little bit green
Yeah, they're a little green
I like them
They seem like they're thicker lenses than the last ones
But maybe I never really took too close of a look at your old ones
They're thicker rims by a wide margin
So they're bigger
That's true, that's for sure
And they're thicker rims
So the lenses, because my eyes are so terrible
The lenses, whenever I had the smaller pair of glasses
They like had to contort them in weird ways
But that should make the new lenses look smaller
Well, because my
Or those ones look bigger
Because you had smaller rims
Right
If you looked at them from the side, the other ones looked like they were like four inches long
Yeah
No, these are good
I can see further around my eyes
Did you get an eight minute exam to get those?
No, they gave me the full exam
They gave me the full exam this time
Nice
I, I, I, I, I, they even
I told them, I mean, every time
Every time it's like, guys, we can, we can skip over the
They just never do
They always have to do it
They love it
They just love hitting you in the face with that air blast
Yep
So, Jordan, today we have an episode to go over
Congratulations on the eyes
Thank you
But, yeah, before we do that, let's take a little moment to say hello to some new wonks
Ooh, that's a great idea
So as to not spoil anything about what our episode is going to be
So first, Jerra-ket and the horse he rode in on
Thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk
I'm a policy wonk
Thank you very much
Thank you
Next, there are too many wonks today, I just can't get into it
Thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk
I'm a policy wonk
Thank you very much
Got a little bit of Alex at the end there
Next, thank you for the Dixie Kong love
The only good character I know who shares my given name
Thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk
I'm a policy wonk
Thank you very much
Imagine being born named Dixie Kong
That's just
Yeah, not a lot of positive Dixie Kongs in culture these days
It's true
Next, Austin Rose, happy anniversary
Derek says Andy in Kansas
Thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk
I'm a policy wonk
Thank you very much
And, curse you Kingsley, I was just here for the gummy bears
Now I'm a wonk
Thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk
I'm a policy wonk
Thank you very much
And we got a technocrat in the mix, Jordan
So thank you so much to Right Wing Cruelty Isn't a Bug
It's a feature
Thank you so much, you are now a technocrat
I'm a policy wonk
Four stars, go home to your mother and tell her you're brilliant
Someone, someone, sodomite sent me a bucket of poop
Daddy shark
Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp
Jar Jar Binks has a Caribbean black accent
He's a loser, little, little titty baby
I don't want to hate black people
I renounce Jesus Christ
Thank you so much
Yes, thank you very much
So now, Jordan, we have a situation
We're doing an episode today that we were gonna do last time
Right
But there was breaking news and Alex did that special report that was so disgraceful
Horror
And so I had to boot this to now
And what we're doing today is a special episode for DJ Dan Arkey
Yay!
I talked a little shit on one of our episodes for fun
And I did send an apology email that if you, hey, I hope you didn't take this the wrong way
Of course you did
And of course Dan Arkey was totally fine
But, also, I got an email that Dan Arkey would like us to cover an episode from January 20th, 2010
Because it has, quote, sheer stupidity in it
Alright
And I think we could all use a little bit of sheer stupidity, a little bit of a break
I believe him
And, also, this is where some drops that have been used
Oh
That we haven't talked about on the episodes, or we haven't covered on our show
Sure
But Dan Arkey is used in things, some of the drops are from this episode
This is like a backstory, this is a lore episode
Somewhat
Oh shit
Yeah
But I figure we all need a little bit of fun
I'm down
And so thank you Dan Arkey for making those themes for us when we were in the UK
And just in general
Yes
These themes are always so wonderful
And so here's an out of context drop from today's show
You're under mind control folks, I am sane
I am sane
You are insane
If you don't look at these facts and your humanity's gone
For some of you out there that don't understand
You're insane
I'm sane
I appreciate
I just don't understand how you can live in a year that begins with a 2 and not go
The moment I've said you're insane and I'm sane
The whole thing should stop
Can't you see
Everyone should just stop, everyone should just be like hold on
I get what that sounds like
Let's restart
Can't you see, through the mind control
No, no, stop
Reset
So today we have basically one large theme that goes over the course of the show
And then there's a couple of mini things that I don't even think are worth talking about
Because the major theme is just that important
That you are sane and I am insane
No
Or I am sane and you are insane
The insanity plays into it for sure
But no, it's that Alex couldn't sleep last night
Oh that makes sense
And he might have
That makes sense
He might have had a vision and a download from God
We're going to be live here for the next 4 hours
I'll tell you about some of the guest information we're going to be covering today
Here in just a moment
But last night I did a radio interview, went to bed at about midnight
And at 3.35am I woke up and couldn't go back to sleep
And I just sat there in the dark for hours thinking about this country, the planet, what we're up against
And I just had this overwhelming feeling, you know in the quiet stillness of the night
That I'm not living up to the real potential of what I'm supposed to do
And that I'm not doing the job I should be doing in the incredible position I'm in
And one, one person was in my mind
Yeah, one person was in his mind
He was thinking, he was sitting there at 3.30 in the morning, couldn't fall back to sleep
Sitting in his living room for hours staring at the wall
Realizing he's not doing a good enough job in his career
Realizing that he is failing his potential
And one person is just on the tip of his brain
One, I don't know why, I feel like it's going to be Rod Paul
Two, I think this confirms such a terrible, I don't know quite how to describe it
You know that idea of somebody doing something horrible
And just having no qualms about it, just continuing on doing horrible shit
And you're like well at least you can, at least there's a certain amount of envy there
The idea that Alex has spent so much time racked with guilt over doing his job poorly
And still does not change even the slightest little bit of it
Is almost a terrifying nightmare in and of itself right
Well I mean it's self reported
That's a good point
I don't know if I believe this necessarily, it's a good dramatic picture for him to paint
But I don't know if he was staring at the wall for hours
I must say, I am saying you are insane Alex
I like the idea now of like a Faustian bargain
But where Faust was just fucking with the devil the whole time
He was like oh this is a tragedy, I'm struggling with my actions
Oh my god it's terrible, oh my god this is so great, I love this
Oh being the devil is awesome
It would be a little different
So this one person that's on his mind
I feel like it's very easy to get shades of the Tucker Carlson's the most important man in the world
And I wish that that was how this played out
Because I would love to tease that out and drive you nuts with it
But Alex reveals who this person is immediately
One person was in my mind
And that was Glenn Beck
Hello
Glenn Beck is the counterfeit of what I am
I'm a real person
And I'm a flawed individual like everyone else
And I, many times, I don't think I deserve the incredible platform I have
I agree
I've really rationalized to myself and lied to myself over the years
And tried to play down my importance
Though I have all this deep political and geopolitical and historical understanding
Weird way to put it
A lot of times we're blind, we have blind spots when it comes to ourselves
As much good as we've done, as many people as we've woken up
The world is far too dangerous and in too important a time and I just pray to God
I pray to God to help me be strong
I pray to God to help me be focused and true
And to really be able to articulate to people what I understand
And that is that Glenn Beck is fake
I'm real, he's fake
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It is like an alien learned how to make frequencies make our words
Because he keeps saying words and they make sense in my brain
And I hear them and I go, yes, those are words that when you put them together they make sense
But I know he doesn't mean them
Well, he means some of them
They're not real
He means some of them and I think he means I feel that I'm real
And I feel that Glenn Beck is a rip-off of me
I think actually some of those feelings are merited
Maybe not that Alex is real but that Glenn Beck was ripping some of his shit off
Totally
I think that Glenn Beck had a number of other things he was also doing
But there was a derivative nature to a great period of Glenn Beck's show
Sure, sure, but I mean if you're Alex you can say other people are ripping you off
But the moment you get into a who's ripping off who conversation you get real quiet, you know what I mean?
Yeah, but he's right in this case that Glenn Beck is somewhat ripping him off
And I don't think it's a two-way street because I don't think he's ripping off Glenn Beck
No
But he is ripping off Bill Cooper
Exactly
He's ripping off all the John Birch Society forefathers that he had, you know
Yeah
There is a thing that he's Father Coughlin
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Lord Ha-Ha
I'm part of
Other Nazi propagandists
I'm part of a rich tapestry of assholes
You're stealing our gig, man
Yeah, and I don't like you
Yeah
But he doesn't listen much
He doesn't listen to Glenn Beck's show much
Interesting
But he knows that Glenn Beck is always talking about him
You know, I don't tune into Glenn Beck more than once or twice a week
It still seems too much
Because I'm so busy running my own radio show, doing radio interviews, making films, producing videos
To really keep track of what he's doing
I mainly spend most of my time reading legislation and what's happening around the world
Every time I tune in, it just blows me away how transparent he is
And what a Benedict Arnold he is
I tuned in yesterday for five minutes
Because I get ready at home and then I drive into work, get here about 30 minutes to an hour generally
Before the show starts
And so I'm driving in and I tune into different talk stations around the state
Just to get a feel for what's going on there
And yesterday he was talking about how we need new taxes
He was doing it in his last hour to pay off the banks
And how that's conservative to have taxes raised instead of cutting government or instead of arresting the bankers
And then this morning I tuned in for five minutes
And he was saying that 9-11 truthers are going to infiltrate the White House and kill Barack Obama
I mean what type of...
I can't keep track of it all
I don't have the time to watch this guy every time I tune in, it's pure evil
Mixed with a bunch of patriot talk
Yeah, it's pure evil mixed with patriot talk
So...
I do think that listening to Glenn Beck two to three times a week means you listen fairly regularly
Checking in on him
I mean I guess if it's just for five minutes
That isn't that much
But it's still regular
You know what, I'll say this
2010 Jordan listens to somebody say, oh 9-11 truthers are going to assassinate Obama
Laughs, hilarity
2023 hears that
Goes, if he had said 9-11 truthers are going to hang Mike Pence
He would have been 100% accurate
And then I go like, I don't know if I should ever laugh again
I don't know what anything means ever
What is happening?
So I can explain this one
He's fairly accurately portraying Glenn Beck's words
I found this clip of Glenn Beck talking
And it's interesting because what he's saying isn't accurate
Like Alex is saying that Glenn Beck was saying that 9-11 truthers are going to infiltrate and then kill Obama
And the reality is that at this point in history in 2010
Glenn Beck was convinced that Obama's special advisor for green jobs
Van Jones was a 9-11 truther
So Alex kind of knows this
But he's not really wrestling with the fact that this is what Beck is talking about
He's not talking about Luke Radowsky trying to get in the Obama administration and kill him
As a 9-11 truther
He sounds already there ready to take the shot
Is that what we're talking about here?
That's basically it
So this was Glenn Beck coming up with an anti-left wing conspiracy
Where Obama was being blackmailed by the far left to not moderate any of his positions
Because if he did, that extreme left, like Van Jones, was going to kill him
Please tell me that we did that
It didn't
It would have been such a good move on our part
This is actually a conspiracy that I think sounds right at home on Infowars
The only problem is at this point in time Beck wasn't on board with the 9-11 truthers
He was pretending to be above that whole rabble
So because of that he used the name 9-11 truther to attack Van Jones
And in the process Alex's feelings got hurt
And that's why we're here and he couldn't sleep last night
And he stared at the wall for hours
So Glenn Beck making fun of the far left for 9-11 truthering
And at the same time trying to convince people that they're insane
I'm not certain that I would characterize it as making fun of
Sure
Sweeps up Alex in the undertow
Finds himself with a little Alex attached to a little aluminum cans six pack thing
And because Alex identifies as this 9-11 truther
He thinks that Beck is saying that he's going to kill Obama
Or his associates who just have questions about 9-11
I find it interesting, we can go back and track Alex's ability to engage with what Glenn Beck is actually saying
I feel like every couple of years he has a completely different thing that he either understood or completely misunderstood
And then he's like, I hate Glenn Beck, actually Glenn Beck's a great friend of mine
I hate Glenn Beck and it has nothing to do with what Glenn Beck actually said, ever
Not usually, no
And I want to be clear, if you listen to this episode, Alex does know that he's talking about Van Jones
So there is an awareness of that but that's not how he's presenting what he wants the audience to experience this as
And so that's a little bit, it's a mess
Also considering that Glenn Beck had the blaze and he used to employ Steven Crowder
Now Alex is on the mug club with Steven Crowder
There's more direct lines between them these days than he would have thought back in 2010
The churn of far right lunacy is, ugh
So we're used to tech issues on the show
We've heard of them
But here we find a unique one
Interesting
Also new developments on the Austin gun show being shut down
And so, I'm just pausing because playing in my ear is thunderstorms
And I'm sitting here on air and there's thunderstorms going off in my ear so I was asking the guys if they could hear that
It's gone now, did you guys hear that?
That's really strange
Yeah there's some white noise
So yeah, he has difficulty with this and it ends up being an issue with his microphone
Yeah, that makes sense
And so they do end up resolving this but it does require him to go off air
And so he throws it to a song, the revolution
Wake up boys, there's a candle on the window
Gotta do it
So before he does that though, he explains his feelings about Glenn Beck in a way that I didn't really expect that this is what was under the surface for him
The people are waking up so that's an incredibly positive thing that is going on
But the other issue is what do we do though because the establishment is taking on our political coloration but is absolutely guaranteed to betray us
And so where does this go in the political process and I mean this is the big issue
We have the people's attention, the people are in the process of really getting educated and waking up
But the system is coming in with their full bag of tricks
We're gonna figure out what's going on technically and then we'll be right back but this song is for you out there fighting for liberty and freedom
Is there a thunderstorm in the back of that song?
I did not expect that the presentation of this would be that Alex is so popular and the public is so into what he's doing that the establishment has had to create a fake him in Glenn Beck in order to lure people away or something
That's interesting because it's not just somebody who's like a crass opportunist who's using like stealing a gimmick in wrestling
It's not just that, someone going into business for themselves by stealing
It is the globalists have created Glenn Beck as a fraudulent Alex. That's nuts
It would be, I mean, it raises the stakes so much higher, you know like if I'm me watching somebody and they're doing the five minutes that I have on YouTube or whatever
I'm sitting there going like man, they should have stolen from somebody better instead of being like well obviously the globalists grew me in a lab in order to do five minutes of material slightly worse than me
To tarnish my reputation for average comedy
I don't know if I've ever mentioned this on the show, I can't remember what we have and haven't talked about, but did I ever tell you about there was another guy named Dan Friesen who
There was a comedian, or an aspiring comedian in Canada, I got an email from him one day, he was like in high school, he was a younger guy
And he was like I found your video online, am I going to do your routine at the talent show or whatever, I'm like you probably shouldn't do that
And his rationale was that we have the same name
You got the same name, can't prove anything
I was like that's interesting
That is sovereign citizen level thinking
That's probably going to hurt me more in the long run, but I'm not sure what ended up happening with that
He's doing an interesting show, I think you'll like his podcast called Knowledge Funny
As I recall he ended up being a background extra in a Dunkin Donuts commercial
And then I think also an extra in an underworld film, and that's where we lost track of each other
That actually I am jealous of, I would have liked to have been in an underworld film
Would you like to be a vampire or a lichen?
Boy, you know, it goes back and forth, if you stick with the lore, sometimes you're the vampires, they're the good guys, sometimes you're the lichens, they're the good guys
I think I would be a vampire
You know what it is? Conflict is the bad guy
I don't want to be a werewolf
Fair enough
So Alex can't watch these people out there being tricked by Glenn Beck
No
It's just, it hurts
It's so painful to watch people being conned, to watch people being manipulated, to watch people falling for the same tricks over and over and over again
And to hear people saying that sales taxes, value added taxes, excise taxes to pay off money to banks we don't owe is conservative
To watch somebody get up and say we need to pass the banker bailout in October of 2008 and now say they were against the bailout
To say that Ron Paul's a kook and his supporters need to have the army sicced on them
To hear them today, Glenn Beck say that, and again I tuned in for five minutes, I can't imagine what's going on on his show
Crazy stuff
I really worry for Barack Obama if he changes his communist ways
I'm really worried that if he moves to the middle that 9-11 truthers that he has in his White House secret service better protect him
He basically says the 9-11 truthers are going to kill him
That's like saying Marvin the Martian is going to land from Pluto and start eating children's brains
It's just total yellow journalism fraud
I do agree with that on some level and that is that Marvin the Martian is not from Pluto, it's from Mars
It's right in the name
It is so thoroughly in the name
Yeah but you can see in that clip there the way that Alex is playing this weird game of trying to have both sides
There's 9-11 truthers in his administration and then also 9-11 truthers as a whole
And it's just an attack on Van Jones, quite frankly, that's what Glenn Beck was doing
Yeah it does feel like Alex is trying to go out of his way to take offense at this
I guess? He's taking offense
I think he is and I think that part of it is he's super defensive, he didn't get enough sleep, should have taken a nap
Probably. And then also I think you noticed a little something there of it hurts to see people getting conned over and over
There's a little projection
There is a little bit of very clearly, I don't know if he means to, but he's talking about his own show when he's complaining about Glenn Beck
Yes 100%
And that's why he has to scream like, I'm real, he's fake
Yeah
So you guys are both doing the same shit
Yeah it is always difficult to remember because you're so used to all the great punishments
But for these types, the greatest punishment of all is a mirror
Yeah, it's tough to look into
It's tough to look into
So if you don't want to look into a mirror, you can look over to the side
And you know what you see over there? Savage, Michael Savage
You look over here, what do you see? Rush Limbaugh
No, we're in a hall of mirrors
So Alex likes those guys more than Glenn Beck
Yeah well that makes sense
And at this point he does not like those guys
I've had my problems with Rush Limbaugh
Jealousy
Being a rhino
And I've had my problems with Savage, with talk of restricting free speech until his speech gets restricted
But these guys are nothing compared to Glenn Beck
And Glenn Beck is consciously an operative of the New World Order, he revels in deception
I mean I listen to it and it is levels of twisted deceit
I'm not moving, nope
That are, it's just devilish
It's devilish
Maybe he didn't fix that mic
Or maybe his stomach's growling
There's a lot of possibilities
Yeah that's strange
I genuinely kept sitting there thinking like
Oh my god I need to be more still just to control myself
There's no way this is me
There is no way this is me
Yeah that is more sound artifact from him
But the more important point is Glenn Beck is devilish
Glenn Beck is demonic
Purposefully, why is this?
Because he's working with the New World Order in order to create a fake version of Alex in order to ruin Alex's life
You only listen to five minutes
But he listens to five minutes three times a week, he knows
That's almost somehow less qualifying for a good response
This is an attack on Alex, Glenn Beck's existence is an attack on Alex, you understand?
I don't know, maybe
And he's working directly with the globalists and Alex knows that he knows this
That I definitely believe
Why not?
I think Alex just needs to take a nap
But I found this thought to be fairly interesting as well
He's the guy now leading the Tea Party movement out of anybody out there
Not Sarah Palin, not Ron Paul, not anybody
It's Glenn Beck
And they're creating a cult of personality around him
And he plays his role well
He acts like a clown and a fool
Calls himself a circus clown
Or a rodeo clown
For the cover of Time Magazine and Newsweek
Does the fake crying on camera
Says it's all fake
So that liberals hear that
And don't become populist against the New World Order
Because they think Beck is behind it
And they go running back into the arms of Obama
He's meant to look so bad to the left
That they go ahead and go along with Obama
And his agenda
Because the alternative is Glenn Beck
Which is silly
I don't know of anybody who's like, you know what?
I don't like it, but I support Obama
Because the alternative is Glenn Beck
That seems very weird
Of the binaries that I have ever been faced with
That one is as far away from possible as I can imagine
But I do like the assessment
That Glenn Beck makes himself look bad and stupid
In order to drive people towards Obama
See, now that's projection
I mean, everything is projection in that clip
He's describing Glenn Beck's show
I'm like, that sounds like you, man
He's yelling, he's a rodeo clown
He's just making all kinds of noise
He's saying all kinds of weird things
He's making sound bites that people like to remix
He calls himself the meme machine
It's sensationalist bullshit is what it is
And I will not stand for it
This is very clearly
I don't know if it's intentional
I really don't think it is cognizant
I don't think he realizes how
Much of a self-indictment this is
I mean, there's no way that he could
Seriously be like, hey listen
This person does such a bad job
Being the thing that I say is good
That it's making people want to go be friends with Obama
Without being like, I am doing such a bad job
That I am driving people to Obama
Right
You can't do that
And that like, I do such a weird bad thing
And I am uniquely gifted at it
Yeah
By way of like distraction tactics
And performance and all this
And Glenn Beck is not good at it
So him doing it must be a conspiracy
Yeah
Instead of just looking at like, no
What you're doing is bad
You're just able to get away with it a lot better
Than someone who has a job
Because they have a boss
Okay, alright
Let me pitch you this
Yeah
Here's what I see now
This is what I'm seeing
I'm listening
More and more about Alex
And how he came to be what he is, right
So Alex evolved in a cave, right
So he's got eyes
But they don't actually see
You know, they're residual eyes
They're vestigial
Right
So then
Out of nowhere
What's this wake coming
He can feel water
There's a fish
It's got googly eyes on it
Right
Put there
It can actually see
But it's making fun of Alex
For not being able to see
This is what it must feel like to be Alex
A sightless fish
I'm
Being touched by a googly-eyed fish
I'm struggling with your metaphor
But yeah, sure
I'll go with it
Yeah, it's something along that
You know what, it got away from me
But I think there's something there
I'm not sure about the introduction of the googly-eyed fish
The googly-eyed fish is where I got distracted
Until you got there
I was with you that he is a sightless fish
That part I'm fine with
So we get off this topic of Glenn Beck
And his devilishness
Because we have to talk about how every single person
Who's been elected into the European Parliament
Is, well, a lot of Alex
Dracula?
No
I wanted to open the phones up in the first hour
We have a guest coming up in the next hour
To talk about what's happening in England
And in Europe
As it's discovered that basically
Almost every new member of Parliament
Their economist
In the EU are open Marxist Leninists
Stalinist, Maoist
What's going on?
I mean, is this a communist invasion?
No
The big banks always put communists in
Yup
So
I don't know if he were pressed on it
Much like he doesn't seem to have a real robust knowledge
Of what the difference between Hamas and Hezbollah is
I don't know if he would know the difference between
Marxist Leninists and Maoists
Or Stalinists, Leninists
I don't know if you'd know these different
Sort of schools of communism
From each other
I think what I find fascinating is that
He, by knowing that they have different names
Suggests there is a difference between them
Well, he's read them in, like, screeds
Written by Gary Allen
And Phyllis Schlafly
Right, they all have different names
Which suggests they would need a reason
To be differentiated from each other
Well, it's just distraction
It's trying to make you think that there's differences
But in reality, it's all one compound noun
Marxist Leninists, Maoists, Stalinists
Stalinists, yeah
And I appreciate that the banks
They fucking love those guys
Love them
So Alex has this guest on
And it's probably not a name that you'd recognize
But I would be interested if you did
Now, we are joined for the balance of the hour
With the European Member of Parliament from Yorkshire and Humber
For the United Kingdom Independence Party
We are joined by Godfrey Bloom
Godfrey Bloom, MEP.co.uk
To talk about a host of issues
But I wanted to get him back on last week
When I saw some press releases he was putting out
About the type of people
That are coming into the European Parliament now
And the type of bureaucrats that are hiring
Are open Marxist Leninists
So Godfrey Bloom is the person who's making this shit claim
I do not know Godfrey Bloom
And that's okay
It's a name that doesn't ring out widely in the United States
But I'm pretty sure that most of our UK listeners
Who aren't really young
Probably rolled their eyes
When they heard that name be announced
He's a very well known figure in UK politics
And has been described as many as a
Quote, national embarrassment
In 2013, Bloom gave a speech
Where he argued that the UK shouldn't be sending aid
To quote, bongo bongo land
Which is a traditional racist term
Used to describe countries in the developing world
Usually in Africa
This caused such an outroar and an embarrassment
That Nigel Farage, in his capacity
I'm sorry
As the head of UKIP
Had to plead with Bloom
Not to use that term again
Nigel Farage is like, reel it in buddy
You know, you know, of all the
No, that's
Fine, fine if we're
But no, no no no no
Despite Farage pleading with him
To never use the term again
He claims he's never apologized
I'll read to you here from a profile about him
In the Telegraph
Quote, I've never apologized, he blusters
With another thump of the table
And I never will apologize
What I did, and I was very careful
Was to say that if I have caused genuine offense
I regret that
It's a derogatory phrase, yes
But I meant it to be derogatory
I didn't mean it to be racist
The boss man said, don't use it again
And I won't, because I'm a disciplined individual
And he's the boss
That's a real, ah boy
I wish I didn't, I wish I didn't understand
Those words perfectly
So it's an interesting thing to hear Bloom
Describe himself as disciplined
Because his track record would suggest
The exact opposite
In fact, if you look at his past pattern of actions
He seems like an unhinged drunk bigot
For instance, in 2008, Bloom was
Carried out of the European Parliament chambers
After delivering a speech drunk
Oh boy, I mean, you're off to a bad start
You're off to a bad start souring me on a guy
Presumably he couldn't walk out under his own power
That's what I would like to hear
Or he was being dragged out
He would have to be, yeah
There's no other reason to be dragged out
So this wasn't the only time
He's been caught being drunk on the job
And there was one famous instance where
In the middle of a debate
He drunkenly interjected with his thoughts
About whether the Cambridge women's rugby team
Should have their numbers on the front or back
Of their uniforms
That's a good question
Well, it wasn't relevant to the debate at hand
Well, you know, I think a lot of people
Could disagree with that
And there's a lot to be said about the micro
Being applied to the macro
So he doesn't seem to be all that disciplined
And that's just in terms of substance abuse
While at work
Right
If you extend discipline to include things like
Not saying shit that's gonna cause a huge controversy
And make it so you lose all of your political capital
And you can't get anything done
Then Bloom is the least disciplined person around
So just to be clear
Bloom ended up quitting his post in UKIP
And exiting politics
After he had his ability to engage
In party business removed in 2013
This happened after he gave a speech
At UKIP's annual conference
Where he lambasted women in politics
As being sluts who didn't clean behind their fridges enough
I'm so mad
I hate these people so much
Because this is the guy you want
This is you
Don't you dare
Like this is the guy
He's a little to them
No this is you
And this is the you that I would be like
Well listen I'm gonna hang out for a while
I'm not gonna be cool with any of this
But if we're at a bar
This is going to be a couple hours of entertainment for me
There's a show happening here
Absolutely
It's an offensive ass show
You're making the cool fun piece of shit go away
And you're staying around
I would retract that word cool
I want
Well yeah I would very much want
No no no
I want all of them gone
Right so here's the thing
The dull banal malevolent people
As opposed to the bombastic
Guy who's really clear about what he's about
I think it's more like this right
When Nigel Farage is like
Oh don't use that term anymore
The bongo whatever it is right
I say this
Use the term all you want
Get rid of all the racist fascists that are around you
And then we won't care so much about the words
Yeah the word itself is less important
Than the mentality that the word represents
And you're not rooting that out at all
You're not even coming close to rooting that out
You're getting rid of the people who make it at least interesting
Well and make it visible
Yeah
Make it overt
Yeah yeah yeah
So anyway he called women in politics
Sluts who didn't clean behind the fridge enough
Sure sure
So after that big joke
Bloom was outside talking to journalists
And a question was asked about how
In all of UKIP's campaign materials
There were no non-white people
Bloom then accused the journalists of reverse racism
And hit Channel 4 news reporter Michael Crick
On the head with a rolled up leaflet
This guy's a mess
That's just the way you do it though
So naturally this got even more attention onto him
And the UKIP leadership was pretty unhappy about the whole thing
Overshadowing their big event
Instead of all their cool ideas
All the press was about this raging lunatic
That they had as one of their MEPs
So Bloom's whip was removed
And then he quit
Fun fact, at this point in 2013
UKIP had one woman MEP
Yeah
She quit the party and said that Farage
Quote, does not like women
Yeah no shit
Yeah
But this whole thing about calling women in politics
Sluts, this really wasn't a one-off situation
Bloom had made a trend in his career
Of being super anti-women
As far back as 2004 he was declaring publicly that
Quote, no self-respecting small businessman with a brain
In the right place would ever employ a lady of child-bearing age
In another 2004 speech he said quote
I want to deal with women's issues because
I just don't think they clean behind the fridge enough
Seems to be a focus
Yeah, yeah, he likes that one
I'm here to represent Yorkshire women
Who always have dinner on the table when you get home
I'm gonna promote men's rights
But his issues didn't stop there
In 2010 he was possibly drunk on the parliament floor
When he decided to yell at German MEP Martin Schulz
He chose to yell
Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer
Which understandably
No one enjoyed that
People did not like that at all
I would have had a great day
I would have had a great day
It didn't go over well
I believe it did not
So Bloom refused to apologize
And he was temporarily ejected from the chamber
I mean but do you understand
This is a person
He understands, he and I agree on the definition of an apology
No, well maybe
In a sense he does
Because he's not going to just lie to you and say
I'm sorry for the sake of you going away
He doesn't, he believes
I think you're reading more into this
I think he's a fucking stubborn piece of shit
I agree with that too
I think that's more where it comes from
And you're projecting your own thoughts
I'm just projecting that I want to go to a parliament
And scream nonsense at people
So this was the second time that he was kicked off the floor
The first time was in 2009 for heckling
And at that point he was the first person ever to be expelled from the chamber
In its 300 year history
This is what I'm saying
He's setting records
What do you want from me
So all in all this is an angry bigot with a substance abuse problem
So it kind of makes him the European Alex
Except he got into politics
But after he was booted from politics
Bloom didn't take the opportunity to reflect on how he's a huge pile of shit
Instead he went on being an asshole to everyone around him
For instance in 2014 he was at a debate at Oxford
And a student with a disability approached him
Bloom decided that the right thing to say was
Are you Richard the third
The king who famously suffered from scoliosis
The student rightly took offense at this and called Bloom out
Bloom would go on to tell Channel 4 that the student wasn't offended by it
And they drank and laughed quote
Until one in the morning on the strength of it
The student told Channel 4 a slightly different story
Though they did have a drink together after
The student was offended and quote
We didn't bring it up again
This dude sucks
And in 2017 he called Goldman Sachs quote
An international Jewish bank
There we go
So he has a little bit of that flavor in him too
Well what did you think wasn't
Like what's not in there
He's got a lot of hits
He's rangy
Listen if you're looking at that
Taking a taste of that stew
And you don't think the anti-semitic gumbo is in there
You're out of your mind
Yeah that seasoning is there
So yeah that's the guy
Real excited to have his thoughts about how there's Stalinist
Marxist Maoists
All being elected to the EU parliament
Wow
But we're not gonna hear that because it's a fucking boring interview
That's
Unconscionable
That is
Unconscionable
Well it's unbelievable that it's a boring interview
But I think that's because it's not an adversarial space
This is a person who really is only interesting
When there's hostility involved
And for Alex
He's obsequious
And he's like oh this is a guy who's in the European parliament
Who believes the same shit I do
Oh you're a hero
Yeah
So there's no reason for him to bring out the thing that makes him interesting
Which is his lashing out at people
Yeah
Yeah no that's why I said
That's why I didn't say oh that's unbelievable
Or oh that's
It's unconscionable because it's on purpose
It's a purposeful act we were deprived of something great
Which is Alex and this guy getting into a weird drunken argument about nonsense
Right
And that would be much more interesting than the hour of nothing
Ugh
That happens here
Ugh
Oh my god all these people are communists
Gross
Yeah
So we get back to Glenn Beck
Because that's what happens after the interview is done
Okay
Alex gets back to Glenn Beck
Alright
Again I know you as the audience know this
But we've got to get this message out to people
I mean really we should write a news article
Kurt Nemo, Paul Watson, Aaron Dyke, Steve Watson, somebody
Or some other news website
Somebody ought to really go through
And compare Glenn Beck to Barack Obama
And the only thing they really disagree on
Hair?
Is global warming being man-made
And government-run healthcare
And Glenn Beck is 100% right on those issues
And it's great and I would love
Look folks I'm not attacking Glenn Beck
Because he's got a bigger radio show than mine
And a big TV show okay
I'm not here trying to win a popularity contest
I don't like to end fight
I don't like to sit here and call people out
In the media and make a big spectacle and issue out of it
That's all everybody else does
Beck is so key to this though
Where he's been placed
The things he has done
His history
That it goes against my instincts
I hate to have to go after Glenn Beck
But I know I must
He must
He must
Alex hates infighting so much
He is like
I was the greatest gunfighter in the world
And finally I retired to my own little ranch
Middle of nowhere
Wife, kid, two dogs
Right
American dream
Somebody comes out of here
A fish with googly eyes
And now I gotta bring the gun back out
I might have brought that back too soon
Right
But the only thing is
I like that sort of story line
As being what you're superimposing on this
But in that case you were a highly competent gunslinger
Before you retired
That implies that Alex was the best at calling people out
And he is not
He is not the best at infighting
But he hates it
But he must
He must do it
Imagine being kind of an alcoholic hobo gunslinger
That kind of lucked his way into a sweet gig
And then the government cloned you
To create a shittier version of you
To take the same gig
But what about
The
Googly eyes
The googly eyes
I've dropped that one for a second
So I wanted to look up some of the
Things that Obama was into
Maybe Glenn Beck also did not agree with
Sure
The TPP, Trans Pacific Partnership
Oh yeah yeah yeah I remember that one
There's some gun control stuff that Obama was interested in
I've heard of the gun control stuff
Some gun reform
Yeah
I don't think they saw eye to eye on Iraq issues
That war
The debt ceiling crisis that came around
But I guess that's in 2013
So that's after this time in 2010
Yeah
Um
The Wall Street reform
The Dodd-Frank
I think they probably saw didn't see eye to eye on that
Oh man that one went well
Did Glenn Beck and Obama have similar education policies?
Because I bet they didn't
I bet they probably didn't agree on that at all
Oh what about the Iran deal
That one was definitely an issue
Yeah I think so
I think they had entirely opposite ideas about policy
You would expect that to be
But no just those two
Meh
Just those two
Climate change
And what was the other one?
Uh
What was the other one?
I don't even remember because it's not important
Oh healthcare
Healthcare yeah that's right
You know what's funny about that is that I actually think that
If push came to shove
I think Obama and Glenn Beck would have a very similar view of healthcare
Not on air
Not on air
They don't agree on anything
No
Especially not if it's useful for this conversation
They could agree on everything and it wouldn't matter
Alex would still say that they don't agree on it
It's infuriating
Yeah
So anyway Alex hates watching Glenn Beck
And I gotta say listening to this I can relate
Yeah
I can relate to that
Alright
There is something diabolical
There is something just truly demonic about Glenn Beck
And again you can go pull the clips up
Saying Ron Paul's a kook
Saying we need to arrest 9-11 truthers
Saying we're terrorists
I heard him say it again today
I never used to tune in
I would see YouTube clips
Now I'm forcing myself and it's like
Going into a porta potty and opening the lid and looking in
I mean I don't want to
And I'm having to look at this
But I can't stop myself
And I'm just like look at it
It's so fake
Yeah I kind of feel the same way looking at Alex's jokes
Kind of like looking at a porta potty and being like
Oh my god it's all fake
Yeah
Yeah very very relatable
Yeah although that kind of makes your job
Your job as the guy who goes to the porta potty
And opens up and looks in and then like
Unlike at a gas station where they like cleaned
You just check still there
Still bullshit
I curate the things that are there to show you
And give you a tour of the porta potty
Right right
It is strange to like on some level
I'm listening to this episode
And Alex is describing my experience of listening to him
And that's weird
Yeah
It's not exact
But there's enough layers of it
That it is a little surreal
Yeah it makes me want to strangle
You know like if you're behind him
And you're listening to him in this like ghost scenario
You know it's like you are driving me personally
And saying no
You've completely stepped into this world
That I can't handle
It goes to your simulation ideas
Yeah
So Glenn Beck stealing everything
Stealing it
From Alex
I heard him before I turned him off
I couldn't listen
Talk about the left right paradigm
This guy is taking everything I've pioneered
Everything I say
Everything I do
And is distorting it and twisting it with a wicked counterfeit
I would love if he took ideas and systems
That I pioneered on the radio
And took it if it was pure
And added his own information to it
If he was a good guy
If he was a good guy
But it's horrible to know that
He's taken all of my points
And twisted it around
And is conning everybody
And I know they're listening right now
And when Damon Vickers mentioned me on his show
Beck literally swole up and turned red
I mean Beck
Look
You're not going to be happy and satisfied
With the 50 million dollars you make every couple years
If it sells out humanity
It's going to come out you're a traitor
Just like Obama
Just like Bush
Just like everybody else
But listen here's the key
They are scared to death of 9-11 Truth
They know that 9-11 Truth is annihilating them right now
Because they can't stage terror attacks anymore
Because everybody's looking for it
So the White House is number one enemy
Just 9-11 Truth
So what happened then?
If that's the case
Then what happened?
Why did false flag attacks happen again?
Because according to Alex they definitely did
Yeah
A lot
Yeah
And I don't believe that his position is
There hasn't been a false flag attack since 9-11 Truth became hot
Between 9-11 Truth becoming hot in 2010
No false flag attacks
I don't believe he'd be able to say that
Based on his own coverage
I was just thinking of that
Like how crazy that time period seems to be
Because it seems so long to me
That he's not immediately
Like there's not another false flag in between
There is
9-11 and that he's just rattling off though
You know what I mean?
Yeah but there are
Sure
There are just things that he's probably forgotten happened
Right
And he forgot he called a false flag
Right right right
Because it's almost a knee jerk reaction at this point
That it reduced to meaninglessness
No it is
But I am saying like the idea of like
Oh well we're dealing with
There's a false flag and it's the 9-11 one
And it's 2010
That's an unprecedented length of time in between
Here we go

The London attacks
Oh yeah
See there we go
Alex thinks that's a false flag
Done and done
They couldn't do that based on 9-11 Truth
If what he's saying is true
His narratives don't hold together
Yeah
It's ridiculous
Yeah
Anyway
Nailed it
Yeah nothing else to say about that
His internal logic doesn't hold
Yeah
So anyway the system
What about it?
Yes
Man
They're so worried about Alex
We already touched on this a little bit
But they had to create Glenn Beck
I mean it's all completely transparent
What Glenn Beck is doing
I agree
And he is even more slimy than Bill O'Reilly
And I've just had it with him
And so I woke up at 3.30 in the morning last night
Really thinking about how I want to try to be more focused myself
And realize the responsibility I have
I mean if they've created Glenn Beck
Who has literally tried to take on
He's like a wolf in Alex's clothing
And he's destroying everything I'm doing
And they're monitoring everything we're doing
And we've reached hundreds of millions of people with my films
Hundreds of millions free online
We are shaking these people up
And of all the groups out there fighting the new world order
We are the main global focal point worldwide
And we're small
So now here's an interesting construction of a thought
You have if they created him
I must be super important
Right
Now I would say that they didn't create him
In order to create Glenn Beck
In order to be a fake Alex Jones
A wolf in Alex's clothing
That would suggest you'd have to go back the other direction too
It would mean that Alex isn't really that important to the globalists
And I think that's a threatening
So you must affirm the premise
The if statement
In order to get to the then statement
Because that's what's really important for your ego
Yeah the if statement is the far more important statement
So the then statement has to be true
No no, otherwise
No no no
The then has to be
The then has to be true
It's so important for the then to be true
That the if must be true
Yeah and that means they created Glenn Beck
It's obvious
Which I would like to see Alex support
I'd like to see some documentation of the creation of Glenn Beck
I would like to know more about that
How much of that is them astroturfing?
How much is that building?
Oh sure
Or how much is that physically constructing the man?
Is this a face off scenario?
Oh yeah
If Alex wants to say that they created Glenn Beck
In the sense that like yeah he's gotten a lot of money
From probably some dark money sources
Sure absolutely
You know there is some of that influence in there
But that doesn't mean that they've whole cloth created him
No but did they implant a computer chip in his neck that will explode
Should he say their own thing?
Did the Koch brothers come around to be like
You need to be a fake Alex Jones
Here's some money
I want evidence of some real brainwashing
I just want a little bit of like real ass brainwashing
Where you can look at it and they go
Well I'll be damned
They totally brainwashed that person
To do the thing against that person's will
I just want one of those
Um Alex has a hundred
Anyway the system
Yeah
The man
What about it?
The globalist
Okay
They're giving you a choice
Alright
And I just thought about what big government does
And how they always do the same thing
This is a system of control
This is a system run by psychopaths
And they want to do that here
They give you false choices
So they're giving you Glenn Beck or Barack Obama
And both of them are so bad
You're giving me that
Left's going to support Obama because Beck's so bad
And the right's going to support Beck because Obama's so bad
And it's elementary
I mean it's elementary
So I guess that when you're above the left right paradigm
This is the choice
The false choice that people are being presented with
Glenn Beck or Obama
Because they both lead the same place
I just I think this is so dumb
Great
Yeah
Yeah
Why did they give me that choice?
Why did they give me the choice between president and cuckoo guy on TV?
Well because cuckoo guy on TV
Actually you know what?
That was our presidential choice after Obama

Yeah
Nevermind
Glenn Beck on TV is like the controlled opposition
As Alex would call him
Judas goat type
Sure
You take the energy and the appearance of sort of being an anti globalist
Against the man and stuff
But it actually just feeds right back into the same
Right
But I don't think that Glenn Beck is getting people to like support Obama
But I guess it would be that he leads you to vote for someone like I don't know Ted Cruz
Well I mean think about it this way right
He gets for you to vote for the republican equivalent of Obama
That retains the system as it exists
Well I mean Trump got us all to Biden right?
Trump is actually the cuckoo TV guy that's there to push us all towards Obama man
That's what's going on
What you gotta do is you gotta get above the left right paradigm paradigm
Yeah yeah yeah you gotta double jump it
Right
That's the problem you're only at the 6th dimension
Alex
I've gone through Pennsylvania
Alex is looking at the wrong level of the matryoshka doll
Absolutely
Which I've noticed you've been saying a lot lately
We said it three times last night
I know and I think you have said it three times
I said it three times in one show
And on another episode
Okay fine
I think you recently learned that word
I did not recently learn the word
We've recorded 800 episodes and we've called it a Russian nesting doll
I don't know why I just said it
Because you just have a word a day calendar
Oh my god I do not have a word a day calendar
Yeah you do
How dare you
I'm certain
I don't have a calendar
Okay
So anyway Alex has tried to play nice with Glenn Beck
Yes
He's tried his best
Okay
And I think that this leads to a section of the show where he's talking to Glenn Beck through his show
Directly speaking to Glenn Beck
And it's
The way a sane person would do
The very sane person
Very sane
It's a little upsetting
I mean it's a lie folks
They're coming after 9-11 truth because they're mad
They're mad that we exposed their favorite toy of blowing stuff up to scare you into submitting to them
And he wants to reinvoke 9-12 the day after your anger
He wants to reinvoke that lie
It is demonic
He is conjuring this
Real quick I want to say that Alex does have a good criticism of Glenn Beck there with the 9-12 thing
Because he's like oh yeah you're trying to bring people to that unity and whatever
Do you remember we were trying to bloodthirsty for war
Yep
It's nonsense
That's a fair criticism that Alex has
It's fair criticism
You gotta give it up when he has something
It is
It is
He is a little devil man
That guy is absolute Benedict Arnold and I am forced to declare war on Glenn Beck
Forced
I have tried to you know get messages to him
What
Videos I've done
I've said stop it Beck
Stop it
I want to believe you're a good guy
Please don't be a traitor
I don't appreciate it
Please don't betray humanity
And that's when I'm not watching him
See I don't watch him
I've tried to get messages through to him through videos that I've done
I tried to
This is
I mean it is just the opposite side of the TV talking back to you
Yeah I mean it
It is a little bit even more surreal though
Whenever it's like a smaller TV is talking back to a big TV that's not talking back to it
But I'm watching both of them
Yeah
That's very strange
I want to clarify one thing because I have used the second person when I've talked about Alex
I've been like you prick or like you know
I have used you
Sure
In
But that is a rhetorical device I'm using
Yeah
I'm not actually thinking
No
That Alex I'm talking to him
I want to differentiate that from what Alex is doing
Yeah
Alex legitimately thinks he's getting messages to Glenn Beck through his show
Yeah no when I say you prick to Alex I am speaking to the performance
It is the audience who is hearing me speak to that you know
Yeah
Yeah it's a play
It's a
It's about mumbery
But not with Alex
Not with Alex
A lot of people will listen today a lot won't but down the road just like every other issue I'm right
I don't have to look in a crystal ball I know who you are
From a distance I've been monitoring and watching and trying to figure out
What you're doing since I first heard you on the radio
Ten years ago in Austin or nine years ago
I've been watching you
And I heard what you were nine years ago
It was all entertainment
And I thought well this guy's a great radio host
This guy does a great War of the Worlds reenactment
This guy's a little hokey
You know a little uh
A little Tinkerbell-ish
Don't hold back
A little prissy
But I guess that's the crowd you run with
I mean that's what runs America is a bunch of little prissy chicken necks
But I mean I didn't like you as a man
I don't think you're a man's man or anything
Okay
But I kind of got an icky feeling
But I admire your skill
As the little thespian you are prancing around on the stage like you like to do
Alex focus
He doesn't even want to do radio and TV
He loves to go into the theater and you know do all of this
And that's fine
I mean who you are is who you are
But listen
We're not going to let you destroy the Republic
We're not going to let you like Benedict Arnold lead us down a rat hole
I think that Alex is trying to imply that Glenn Beck is gay
Uh yeah I think we're taking a very short hop there
Yeah
Now I had a realization recently that I've never had before
What was that?
When he's talking about chicken neck people
Yeah
I think he's talking literally
And the reason that I think that is because he talks about how his neck is thick
Yeah
He has a freakishly large neck
Do you mean do you mean he's you like he's just literally describing the difference between him large necked people
And us small necked people
Yes
As though as though we're a different species of human
Yes it is a morphological thing
Right right right right
It's not it's not a metaphor
Right
I've always thought of the chicken neck kind of thing as being like it's metaphorical
I think he's talking about people who have weak necks
Smaller necks than him
The homo chicken neck bee-less genus
Yeah
Okay
I sincerely do think that Alex has a neck based masculinity index
Alright
That okay so then we look at that little evolution chart
Joe Rogan
Joe Rogan
Big neck
That's true
Whoa
The evolution of necks is truly the evolution of man
As we've seen
I do think that there's something to this though
I realized like within the last week
No
That when he's talking about chicken necks maybe it's not
Maybe it's not
Maybe it's
Maybe it's literal
I mean I think I think that's a good point in that there is a lot more of the literal in in this in this kind of thing than we are
We live a lot in metaphorical speech language
Yeah
You know we're we're we're people who like to do that
And and it's it's often very easy to give the benefit of metaphor to people
Very easy
And it often seems like when you're talking about somebody like Alex
If you take him literally it paints a damning picture
You can't possibly be meant to be taken literally
And so you want to exhaust the possibilities of things being metaphor before you take him literally
Right
And so that's why it never really entered into my mind
Right
That this could be something that is about the size of a neck
Right well to reorient Alex's like to reorient yourself into a place where Alex means literally what he says is to fundamentally come up against a world that you did not believe was real
Right
And have to expand your concept of this world to include that one and fuck if that's not hard to do because that shit shouldn't be here
It's nuts
Yeah
But he's very sane and you're insane
I'm insane and he is sane
Yes
Yeah
So Alex continues talking to Glenn Beck and he tells him what he needs to remember in the future
Also I can't I can't imagine how annoyed must you be as a TV to like want to look down at the other TV and be like listen I don't care what you have to say but just focus and say one thing
Stop stop stay on topic man
And also I'm gonna spend my entire show whining about you
So anyway this is this is where he concludes his thoughts directly to Glenn Beck
Gotcha
And you better hope like Benedict Arnold you get to run to Europe or England buddy because I may die tomorrow or get set up tomorrow or get sent to prison tomorrow by one of your goons you know as you put out the word that we want to kill the president
Glenn Beck's goons
Glenn Beck has goons?
But in the end you're gonna fall and when you're old and you're dying of cancer or whatever it is I want you to remember that I told you that in the public court of opinion that we exposed you and I put a buoy on your butt
You know what a buoy is? They mark rocks they mark danger they mark treachery with a buoy
Thank you
And I henceforth put a buoy on you a marker
Wait what?
I mark you as a traitor as king
I put a buoy on you?
I mark you as a slimeball who I look in his eyes the sick thing is you're enjoying lying to people you enjoy like a snake all day talking about how you have trust with your audience and I mean you're like Grimer Wormwood from Lord of the Rings or something behind the king's throne
I don't know how I'm so mad at all of that
Death into our bones and again you are not a general you are not a patriot you are somebody who's there to get our confidence to sell us out but you can't let your contempt and your hatred for patriots stay under bridle
You reveal yourself it's like Sean Hannity saying arrest all members of the militia he just said arrest anyone in the militia arrest them
See this isn't how things end up going I think Glenn Beck is able to or has been able to get rid of that buoy on his butt because Alex and him are pretty much fine now and they're they're they're compatriots at least in the you know the Trump extremism sector
They certainly have a heavy overlap in terms of people they associate with Stephen Crowder being chief among them
Sure
That was a barrage that was an assault
But it all was very projection-y too
Oh yeah
You imagine Alex saying those things to himself and they make a lot of sense
You know if you imagine him sitting at four in the morning alone in his living room staring at the wall in his spiral of negative self-talk these are the sorts of things that might come up
Oh yeah yeah every time every time Alex starts insulting things I imagine him in front of a mirror and finally everything makes sense you know but that that like I put a buoy on you in such a I've spoken in almost a like magical way I put a buoy on you you know it is it had it has a generational curse aspect of it which I appreciate greatly
I have branded you and your children as traitors
So yeah Alex says something in this next clip that sounds extreme but is actually true
Okay
Back live worldwide ladies and gentlemen the people are waking up across the planet they will wake up to the fraud that is Glenn Beck
Remember a few years ago Michael Reagan the adopted son of Ronald Reagan said I will give you the bullets I will give you the hand grenades murder Mark Dice murder 9-11 truthers he said I'm serious call me I want them murdered
He said that on 300 radio stations that's okay see they can call for killing us but then we say we question 9-11 and Glenn Beck says we want to kill Obama I mean just totally insane
So I don't know if it was on 300 stations but Michael Reagan did legit call for the assassination of Mark Dice
Ronald Reagan's adopted kid called for the assassination of Mark Dice
The reason for this is because he lumped him in with a group of people who were sending 9-11 conspiracy material to troops that were serving in Iraq
It wasn't so much that they had 9-11 conspiracy beliefs it appears as much as it was about promoting dissent among enlisted persons
I absolutely do not support Reagan's actions and I think he probably should have at least been fired for that kind of talk
I don't know if it borders into what is not free speech I think it probably isn't but I'm not sure where the line is because it's apparently a lot further than you think
But from a 30,000 foot view you could make the argument that at this point the only goal of sending troops that material was to demoralize them
Which is debatably an act that's in service of aiding the enemy I wouldn't make that argument but I could see how someone like Michael Reagan might
It is different than just having 9-11 conspiracy beliefs what he was responding to was sending things to the troops that would make them not want to fight the war that they were enlisted to fight in
Yeah I mean it's fairly simple propaganda people have dropped pamphlets on the streets of Paris
You could make the argument that that is a similar act again I wouldn't make that argument
I get what you're saying
This happened on June 10th 2008 and on June 16th 2008 Reagan had Mark Dice on his show and apologized explaining that quote
Sometimes radio hosts we get fired up and angry and say things that are actually stupid and we make mistakes
So I mean Alex doesn't bring up that part of it but you know it's kind of big of him on some level to apologize
I think he means it
Or there was a covering his ass thing
Because there was a big uproar about this and people were like is this the station's policy to allow assassination threats
Yeah that one is a little bit difficult
I know you're Reagan's adopted son and that's great for you and all but I don't know if that gives you carte blanche to call for assassination
Yeah I mean I'm trying to think of where I would diagnose a problem here and it starts way before we get to
Way before we get to Reagan's adopted son is on the air
Yeah it starts with there's a guy named Mark Dice
Absolutely
We gotta go back we gotta go back to the island
This is too further on
So this confused me a little bit this is a pretty confusing clip
We walk down the street and people come out of dark alleyways with girls in wheelchairs ramming them into us
Going he attacked me he attacked me
They're trying to set us up we're in danger we need your prayers
Sorry what?
And Michael Savage says that Obama will stage terror attacks I mean does he deserve to go to prison according to Cass Sunstein at the White House
I mean come on folks common sense they declassified they stage a lot of these terror attacks
If they admit they've done it before and they stand to get power out of it and they're using the entire 9-11 attack for Homeland Security to set up against gun owners, conservatives, libertarians and veterans
Remember Glenn Beck when he did a show on MIAC and the Homeland Security report?
So I have no idea what Alex is talking about with girls in wheelchairs coming out of alleys
I guess that's a fun example of a possible false flag someone could run against him as an attack or something like pretend that he attacked the person in the wheelchair and then set him up that way or something
I think that's what he's getting at I don't know
Right so the idea is somebody would run at Alex with a person in a wheelchair then like throw them at Alex and then when they got into a tussle Alex would then be blamed for attacking a
I assume that that's the general vibe
Yeah something along those lines that sounds right
So more importantly I want you to make note of the way that Alex uses language in that clip
He knows that he's making a point that he absolutely can't defend concretely namely that the US government did 9-11
Because he can't make that point he's required to jump from one piece of suspicious information to another without ever really finishing his sentence
It's helpful to track the argument as it's being made so I've done that here
Here's the basic setup of his argument
They declassified they stage a lot of these terror attacks
If they admit they've done it before and they stand to get power out of it
So Alex is asserting the conclusion is implied
We know what the conclusion is and that's the government staged the 9-11 attack
And so there he's listing off premises that are meant to lead to that conclusion
The first is that they've declassified that they've staged a bunch of these attacks in the past
This is arguable based on what your definition of a bunch is or whether or not you think past examples of false flags are comparable to 9-11
What Alex is actually referring to is Operation Northwoods which is not proof that the government has staged a bunch of these attacks in the past
The premise does not build towards the conclusion but it appears to
There's the optics there
The second premise is that they stand to gain power out of staging this attack
That is abstractly true but it doesn't prove that the attack was staged
At best what this premise does is flesh out some of the questions about motive that Alex's narrative requires
But then as the second premise is being stated Alex veers off into talking about the Patriot Act
Which is actually just an example of what he meant by the second premise
This is the way that the globalists are going to enact gaining power that they were looking for when he fleshed out that motive
Then he jumps off into yelling about Glenn Beck in the MIAC report without ever finishing his thought
This is a manipulative strategy you can use to make it appear that you've made an argument when you really haven't
Alex's argument boils down to a bit of an if-then statement where it's like
If someone admits they've done something before and they would stand to gain from doing it again
Then it's common sense to assume that they have done it
This is a flawed construction and the premises don't support the conclusion at all
But if you're just listening to Alex the way he moves so quickly from this one thing to another
It feels like what he's saying made a lot more sense and there was a solid argument there
When you listen to someone like Alex it's wise to pay attention to this kind of behavior
When someone's laying out an argument that seems thin and they conveniently get distracted yelling about anything other than the point
It's often because they're trying to distract from how thin their point actually is
Which is just what's going on here
But it's really clear, it's transparent
Yeah, I mean, there's doing it this way
Or there's making a bad argument and then being like
Before you continue and ask me questions, how about you watch me do some close-up magic
And then perhaps you will forget about your questions at the end
Yeah, if this wasn't moving so fast and with so much slight of hand, quite frankly
You would recognize like, this doesn't make sense
That doesn't justify the argument that you're making
Oh my god, dude, the coin, you just have the coin in the bottom two fingers
Like you just got really good with your fingers so you can hide the coin and then
That's bullshit, man!
This is wildly circumstantial at best and it's just a thin broth
So Alex gets back to his feelings about needing to go after Glenn Beck
Sure
Because, you know, you talked about the Mayak Report
We're very focused
We weave back
And it turns out that this is actually a very important thing for him to do
Last night I woke up really not even upset, it was more than that
Just like, man, this is real
And I was like, God, what is it I'm supposed to do?
And it was like, go after Glenn Beck
Make a sandwich
And because I hate talking about people
I don't like it
I mean, I don't even like making Obama the enemy or Bush the enemy
You know, they're puppets
I don't like the personality issues because that almost feeds into it
And I'm like, I don't want to talk about him
My way of really disliking him is to not talk about it and try to ignore it
And like, no, don't show me that, no
Yeah, pretending something doesn't exist, you must really hate us
That's what I would say
Also, you don't like talking about people, you don't want to talk about Obama
You made the Obama deception a week into his presidency
Yeah
You love talking about people, you dick
Don't do that
Yeah
Don't do that
I do like, though, I asked God what to do and he said go after Glenn Beck
Go after Glenn Beck
Just solid
Gotta do it
God, what do I do?
Gotta go after Glenn Beck
It's a strange mission, but
It's a strange God
I think of all the things that I have learned from Alex is that God is a weird dude
He's a weird dude with a lot of weird ideas
Here's what God seems to be telling Alex to do
The thing that Alex wants to do, but he knows that it's bad for him to want to do it
It would look bad if he was like, I really want to attack Glenn Beck
I really want to scream about him and really go after him
Because he's occupying a space in the media that I could profit off of
And that is really bothersome
I'm gonna throw this out at you
Okay, so if the main function of your God is to, whenever you run up against a thing that you don't want to do
For that person to give you permission to do a thing that you are not supposed to do
Then are you not really worshiping God so much as you are the devil?
Or is God, in your conception, really just kind of an emotional crutch that you use
In order to justify doing things that you know you shouldn't do, but you want to do anyway?
Ah, it's almost like the devil is created as such
Oh boy
Yeah
So this next clip is highly projecting-y
Oh yeah?
I mean, I'll see articles that we post sometimes because I don't control my writers
I know they've got good brains and they basically do most of the posting and ideas themselves
But I will see some new horrible thing he did and I'll not want to look at it
See, that's the problem folks, I've got all this stuff I read
I'm angry about each article
And I genuinely, once a month or so, I'll be driving down the road and I'll think about the country and the innocence
And how the CPS is taking those kids and raping them
And I'll start crying, and not a sobbing cry
I can't even control it, just tears start running out
And then I see Beck on his TV set, he even shows people this so they'll know he's fake
And on putting stuff in his eyes that makes him cry
And getting into the fakeness of what we really should be crying for this country
He is a counterfeit, folks, he makes me sick
And I just ask God, I said, how do I keep him from taking my work and turning it into something evil?
I mean, I feel dirty because I haven't been sophisticated enough to see this coming beforehand
I just, I'm gonna do the best I can to let God take over from there
God, how do I defend my space in the market against this person who
Clearly has access to greater media attention than me
It has a TV show
Is clearly willing to do some things that I'm not, like have a boss
I'm mad at him for fake crying, although I fake cry all the time
In this clip
He got a little emotional
He was trying, which is even worse
He couldn't successfully fake cry
It's so self-condemning
It's just that all you can come back to is like such a pointing a finger at yourself
Yeah
Like seemingly obliviously
No, it is like a classic like 1970s diva at the opera story
Of like the diva who is obsessed with this younger person
But the younger person is obsessed with the younger person who's obsessed with the young
Like everybody is always doing the exact same thing, blaming the other person
For being the most version of the thing that they hate about themselves
All in service of, you know, keeping a gig
Yeah, very interesting
Yeah, it's weird
Layers
So Alex rambles in this next clip about how good a person he is
More or less
I want to see honorableness and wholesomeness upheld
And then I think about the position I'm in, the responsibility I've got
And all the bad things I do when I'm trying to be good, when I'm trying to be accurate
And then I just think about how I have a conscience
And I'm trying to be as accurate and as good as I can be
And I can't imagine someone who is just as smart as I am or smarter
Who chooses to join with evil and chooses to serve it and enjoys deception
And enjoy...
I mean, all I've got is being real
So close
And that's not like, oh, I'm real, I'm holier than thou, I'm good
Look how good I am
No, I'm bad
But the point is, I am real, and it's who I am
I'm not making myself that way
It's who I am
And that's all I've got, that's what I value
That's...
And then I realize, even if I try the straight and narrow
Even if I focus, even if I'm watchful
Even if I'm as wise as a serpent and harmful as a dove or whatever the saying is
Fucking harmful doves
I still wouldn't let people down, folks
They're feverishly combing through anything and everything I ever did
Making stuff up, lies you can't imagine
And so that's why it is about you being individuals
You know you're good
You know you love freedom
You're not perfect, but your heart is right
Your heart is right
You want to be a good person
You want to be loving
You want to be honorable
And you know you're good
And I know I'm good
I know I'm for real
And so all we can do is do our best and then give it to God
Because it's the burden, it's the burden
It's such a burden
I'm the main guy
The main real thing
I would say that Glenn Beck probably thinks that he's good
And he's real
I think Alex has actually stumbled upon a very very interesting...
I'd also like to take back what I just said
Glenn Beck probably knows that he's putting on an act
In the same way that Alex knows he's putting on an act
Well, but that's the interesting question I have
I think, I mean
I'm not talking about knowledge now
I think what I find interesting is that
I know Glenn could do a different act
If that makes sense
Because he has
Yeah, he cannot do that
Alex cannot not do what Alex does
Yes, there's a compulsion element
Right, so does Alex have something of a point
In that it is more pure
Simply because the performer making this thing
Could not under any circumstances
Make anything else
No, because I think that that's a generous interpretation of Alex's compulsion
Sure
Like he couldn't do anything other than the thing that he's doing
But he could also do something slightly different
In the same way
He could have chosen to not support Trump
Sure
And that would have been an option he could have taken
Sure
And his show would still be him doing the compulsive shit that he does
Right
It just would have been, you know
You know what, that world is such a fascinating possible reality
Alex not supporting Trump
Yeah
Because he would have retained such an iconoclastic stance
And he would have, I guess, been pulling for Rand Paul the whole time or something
Lord knows
But he would have still done the same show that he does
Right
It just would have, there would have been certain other focuses that he took
Right
Covid would have gone a lot smoother for him
Oh my god, I don't even want to imagine that
I don't want to imagine a world where that makes sense
Because then he wouldn't have had to have the whole like
Trump is great except for that he made the vaccine
He could have just had the whole thing
Yeah
But
No, I mean
I mean, I, what would I, like
It does, it does, it's not the same
But it's got the front man
The, you know, like there's the front man who could
It's, it's
Like there's Joy Division and there's New Order
Do you know what I mean?
Yes
Like there's a difference
What you're saying, it almost like to boil it down to stand up
There are people who are naturally charismatic on stage
And they can't not be
Sure
There are some people who when they're doing their act
Can come off quite well and they have a performance
Glenn Beck is that person who doesn't have the natural charisma
Right
And when you have that natural charisma
Maybe you can look down on people who have to sort of fake it
Eh
And put on that act
And maybe there is something to that
But maybe there's not
Yeah, yeah
That's definitely true too
I don't know
I guess
You know, when people ask
Does Alex really believe the things that he says and stuff
Yeah
My position is generally, it doesn't matter
Yeah
The consequence and the reality is the same as it is
Like, is Alex real?
Does it matter that he's real compared to Glenn Beck being fake?
I don't know, I don't think it does
No
It's funny to watch him spiral like this
Yeah
At God's behest apparently
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I mean, it doesn't matter in the real world
I think it's more interesting to try and figure out
What it is that Alex believes he's wrestling with
I'll tell you, demons
Here, listen to this
That's a, well, yeah
But I see it all
Never mind
I see the whole enemy and all of their nightmarish corruption
And wickedness and their sins
And who they are
And I see all the demons, folks
They're all around me
And I'm like, my God
I wish people could see what I see
I wish they knew
The way I can read people now
The way I understand things
It's almost like torture
You know, the level of discernment I just continue to get
God dammit
And then I'm in this weak body
I'm this weak sinful person
And I'm like, what have you done to me, God?
And God says, oh, it's going to get a lot worse, buddy
Buddy
And now I can't change who I am
I can't go back
I can't join with the evil
I wouldn't
But it's just
If people knew what was really going on
If they could only understand
If they could only really have discernment
And I know a lot of you do
And that's why you're active and warning people
I'm really ranting today
Oh?
I woke up at 3.35 in the morning
In the cold dark still of the night
I went in the living room and I just sat there
For hours and hours
And I just
And you know those thoughts you're having
And that still time
The understanding
It was so much more
So much information
It was like downloading information
It was just like
At a certain level
It's good to have the information
And you want more of it
And it's so incredible
But then you want to warn people
Yeah, so he's struggling with demons
All around him
And he can discern
And he can read people really well
Because of these downloads that he gets
When he sits alone in his living room
In the middle of the night
Having weird feelings
Yeah
Yeah, so that's what's going on
Yeah
He's very sane
Yeah, you know sometimes
Whenever you're struggling with information
That other people can't believe
Because it sounds too out there
Right, like there's demons running around
All over the place
That no one else can see
Yeah, you might think to yourself
Oh, this is a personal struggle for me
Because I am trying to share a truth
With the rest of the world
That would allow them to
Interact better with it
Right
But sometimes
When you feel that way
You're actually out of your mind
Yeah, no, everyone else is crazy
And also, I mean, like quite frankly
It's the affluence
That influence
Or that insulates him from
Having to deal with the fact that he's
Yeah
You know, he's seeing a reality
That no one else sees
Yeah
And unfortunately he's convinced
A whole lot of people that
He's speaking in metaphors
And he's created a capitalistic enterprise
Dedicated solely to making sure
He doesn't have to feel
Dedicated to enabling
Yeah, absolutely
Yeah
Which is like
Of all the things that you can do
That is one of the weirder
Well, I mean, think about how that
Is the ultimate business expression
Of a narcissist
Yeah, I mean, yeah
What do you do but create
A lucrative business
Scamming people into
Sending money constantly
In order to defend my ego
From the reality that I'm a mess
Yeah
It is
It is Shakespearean
Yeah
So, also Shakespearean
Is Alex's thoughts about death
He's very stoic
He's very stoic about death
Interesting
I mean, I'm 36 years old next month
And I already feel really old
I've gone past being afraid of death
To not being afraid of death
To not wanting to die
But not even concerned about it anymore
And I know that I've got this far in life
And it seems like five minutes has passed
And in five minutes I'm gonna be 85 years old
Having a stroke, dying
And, of course, all you've got in this world
Is being good and being honorable
And loving your little species
Sweet little humans
I'm sorry, what?
They've got such potential
And we let scum and degenerate
Murderous, lying filth
Run our lives
And just rise up and beat them, folks
Get your guts warmed up
Get your soul on fire
Get some strength
I mean, folks, a lot of you Christians
Claim you're close to God
There's no way you are in tune with God
Because if you were in tune with God
You would feel the unlimited love and passion
And creativity and honor
And everything that is good
And everything that is wholesome
And you would feel ashamed of yourself
Even if you were somebody trying to be good
Oh, you sweet little humans
I just care so much about the humans
The sweet little humans
Oh, the humans
What a great way of describing your love
For your fellow man
Think about the humans
Sweet little humans
It definitely doesn't make me sound like a
Separate alien lunatic
Yeah, and everything is so important
About his Christianity
And his connection to God
And of course, why not send in a little bit of
None of the rest of you are Christians
Because you don't act like me
Only all of you knew and felt and acted
And behaved exactly the way I do
The only true Christians are the people who act like me
That does seem to be a popular sentiment
And it's sane
It's very sane
So Alex gets off this subject
Because he watches a short film about North Korea
And people who are essentially kept as
Is slave the right term?
I guess, yeah
People who are abused under the government and such
And so he comes back
And he's got a bit more fear in him
And he ends up just talking about immigrants
Pretty much the whole time
Well that's what the Republican leader of the Senate
I was like five years ago interviewing him
I forget his name in Colorado
He went out one day
And in two hours got four different consular matriculas
For a hundred bucks
And was able to then go get on welfare
He did it as a stunt
It was in the Denver Post
And I mean it's just unlimited
I mean no wonder the illegals are driving around
In luxury vehicles
And citizens that play by the rules are going bankrupt
Exactly, you got one set of rules for a citizen
Another set of rules for somebody that doesn't have any business
Being here in the first place
Oh man, that's wild
And totally not true
Colorado banned the acceptance of the use of consular ID cards
For government purposes in 2003
And only reversed that ban in 2020
Also this GOP leader that Alex totally interviewed
Who's unnamed
Probably couldn't get a consular ID
Since they're only given to Mexican citizens
You need to present a Mexican birth certificate
And an official Mexican ID in order to get one
You also can't get on welfare with a consular ID
Since they're specifically for non-US citizens
These are IDs that are given out of various countries' consulates
And they're not just randomly dispensed
They have guidelines and databases of people who have them
And the way Alex is presenting this
It's just playing on the audience's inherent racism
In order to trigger their white victimhood fears and feelings
This is like a wild level of
Look at them, they get away with everything
Not like us, whites who play by the rules
That's the long and short of what he's trying to get people to feel
Yeah, you know, you start digging into IDs
And you start seeing that they're like
They exist mainly because
Of finding ways to exclude people that you don't want to have them
As opposed to being like a
Need that is like, you know, that kind of thing
We should just get rid of them
I don't know, I need to think about it a little more
Than to sign off on
All of the IDs
All shoes
All shoes are next
You've missed the part where the shoes are in on the scale
Oh shit
Yeah, I was about to tell you
So anyway, Alex just whines a bit here
More about immigrants being above the law
Oh, sure
Lisa in New York, thanks for holding her on the air
Hi Alex, I was just wondering
Is this how the Meticula Consular
I live in New York
Is this how they get illegal aliens to just drive around?
I've always wondered about that
No, no, no, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, it's the biggest issue
And Republicans never talk about it
Because it's all staged, they want amnesty too
They are all above the law
What?
The Patriot Act doesn't apply to them
Nothing applies to them
They get taxi licenses, everything with nothing
Ma'am, they're allowed to drunk drive where I live
Sheriffs all the time arrest carloads of illegals
And the feds actually hire them on the spot
And go give them government jobs
That's Wall Street Journal
That's Wall Street Journal, ma'am
Wall Street Journal
Yep, they pull over a carload of drunk driving, undocumented immigrants
They're like, hey, we gotta give you a job
See, this is
Gotta hire you for the government position
This is the type of shit
I don't understand how you can be mad in a political way about this at all
Like, my first instinct to be mad in this
If what is being said is true
Which I'll tell you it's not
No, obviously, but here's what makes me mad
This is a poorly run system
Quite
Even if it's for your benefit, to my detriment
You're doing a bad job of it
So you need to deal with that
Whoever's running your case
Could be oppressing me a lot better right now
It makes me so mad how stupid this all is
Sure
And I think that when you get down to it about
The Patriot Act not applying to undocumented immigrants
It might be less that they're exempt from it
And that the concerns that Alex has about his rights being infringed
Those rights maybe aren't enforceable for
Yeah
Undocumented immigrants
I don't know
Do they have Fourth Amendment protections?
I guarantee you, you could quarter a soldier in their house right now
I think
Nobody would stop you
I think it might be possible to do that more easily with undocumented populations
You could just say that it's the soldier's house
Yeah
They've got documents
It's not complicated
Yeah, so maybe they're in a more difficult position to begin with
Could be
And your concerns don't apply
But anyway
How do they get to just drive around like that?
Well, in some states, consular IDs are able to get you a driver's license
I mean, no, no, no, I'm totally fine with that
Yeah
That's what she's responding to
Right, right, right
Like talking points surrounding that
Totally, I just find that such a weird thing to
How do they get to drive around like that?
It is strange
You can just drive
You can just get into a car and drive
It's the same that stops you
Yeah
I drove without a license for more time than I wish I could
Than I would like to say
Take my time in Missouri
You can do it whenever you want
It expired and I couldn't afford to go through the process of getting a new ID
That simple
Anyway, this same caller wants to know what we can do about this
What can you do about these consular IDs?
They're already issuing all of this
Total lawlessness, totally criminal government
What do we do about it? I mean, what can I do?
Well, we are the North Korean slaves
We are the milk hog
And so to further hurt us and further get us bankrupted
So the government can really have its way with us
And then take your children of your poor
That's the real official plan
They've got to hoard in as many illegals as they can to drive down the wages
And further implode and get everybody in debt
Who is in the system trying to pay the taxes that can't keep up
More taxes to crush you
More illegals to drive down wages
And then most importantly, then the illegals
Second generation are made the police chiefs and the commanders everywhere
And then they will rule us because they come from authoritarian regimes
And then they will pull the laborer to take our guns and property
And then they will be the prison camp guards
That's the plan
I mean, it's an absolute New World Order banking plan
Alex is a little more pepped up after he came back from watching that North Korea thing
He had to get a little of that
Oh, foreign people
Yeah, and you may notice the similarity there between the end point of that conspiracy
And his military-aged men conspiracy we heard last week on his show
So this is a preoccupation that he's had over time
Is the idea of populations from Central and South America becoming police and taking his guns
Yeah
Which is weird
It's weird
Well, I mean, it's a good obsession to have
Because it can't and won't happen
Well, sure
But it is also a good obsession to have when you have an audience that is largely made up of
Uncritical thinking, xenophobic bigots
And they love that kind of shit
I...
You know what? Go ahead with that
If that's your plan, globalists
Do it. I dare you
At least in this situation, Alex has an interesting wrinkle to the conspiracy
Where it's you're bringing in people and the second generation is when they get enlisted into
See, now that I find even more, that I find even more hilarious
It's such a long-term plan
I mean, yeah, I'm so...
The problem I have with so many of these plans is I don't want them to be stopped
I don't want to stop them
I want them to try and do it and watch how spectacularly stupid they explode
That's the problem with all these stupid plans
Do you know the level of organization and the number of people that would need to be involved
To carry out a multi-generational...
A multi-generational... In this country?
It's ridiculous
So anyway, this same caller has another question for Alex
And this is the last clip of our show today
Alright, and one more thing
As someone who's interested in getting one of those Ecola Blue
The reverse osmosis machine
As a user, would you...
Have you noticed that perhaps maybe your energy levels have gone up?
Do you feel different?
No, it's just really clean water
It goes through a bunch of filters and is out of the atmosphere
Okay, so you won't notice an energy level difference
Since they're putting fluoride in the water or anything like that?
Oh, are you kidding?
Yeah, a few months after you start drinking really purified water
I mean, really purified, you'll feel an incredible...
Hold the fucking phone
Absolutely
Oh wait, I needed to be reminded of my conspiracy theory
Holy shit
That is part of my sales pitch around these water filters
That's unacceptable
That is a mask off moment that is unacceptable
Yeah, a little bit
Oh, I forgot, I forgot I have a conspiracy about this
So it'll make you feel better?
No, it's just really clean water
I was almost like, that's a good sales pitch
Well, he does catch himself a little bit
And tries to cover by saying like
You know, you're assuming that everyone's already drinking filtered water
Sure, sure
He wouldn't have a boost from other pure water to this
Sure, sure, sure
Well done, well done
Caught off guard with the sales pitch there
Yeah, I mean it is almost a little...
I mean, I would almost be more likely to buy something if he was like
No, no gimmicks, it's just really fucking clean water
I'd be like, actually, I might believe that
I would like clean water, too
Yeah, I might believe that
And to this, I would say this is somebody who seems real
Yeah, and sane
Yeah
Because when I think sane, I think in control
And when I think in control, I think Alex Jones
Sure
On his toes, getting those sales beats
Oh boy
So we come to the end of this
And I appreciate DJ Dan Arkey sending us on this trip
It is kind of fun to see Alex lose his shit about Glenn Beck
Because he didn't sleep last night
And is feeling really self-conscious
And is projecting a lot of his insecurities about himself onto Glenn Beck
Yeah
That's pretty fun
Yeah, it is like if you didn't
If Alex didn't have access to a TV or something
Then there would be a doll named Blen Bleh
That he does the exact same thing to, right?
Like it's just because there is a TV
That he has some thing to project onto
That we also can see
Now let me ask you this
Yeah
That doll, would it be a Matrachka doll?
No, it wouldn't
End of sentence
We're today
So Jordan, we will be back
Okay
But until then, we have a website
Indeed we do, it's knowledgefight.com
Yep, we are also on Twitter
We are on Twitter, it's at knowledge, underscore, fight
Yep, we'll be back
But until then, I'm Neo, I'm Leo, I'm DZX Clark
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop
I'm totally sane, you're sane
I'm sane, wee, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
We're sane, everybody's sane
Woo, yeah, woo, yeah, woo
And now here comes the sex robots
Andy in Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan
I love your work
I love you
