The Gates Foundation stayed involved in the program afterwards, and according to Alex, Gates should have been thrown out of India at this point already.
* Alex’s Sixth Headline doesn’t make his argument. It is just another article, [https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/3/4/301/632859 from the July 1997 issue of Human Reproduction Update], about Gursaran Talwar’s research into birth control shots.
* Alex's Seventh Headline doesn’t make his argument. It is a product of the Population Research Institute, which is disqualifying on its face.
* Alex’s Eighth Headline doesn’t make his argument. It is just Alex saying “contraceptive vaccines,” which is meaningless.
* Alex’s Ninth Headline doesn’t make his argument. He just says “Special Programme of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction” and pretends it’s something he’s read. It’s not something he could read, [https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/hrp/en/ it is an entire organization], so I have no idea what text he’s even referring to.
* Alex’s Tenth Headline doesn’t make his argument. It is [https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(05)60336-4/fulltext an article about opposition to birth control shots in India]. Alex claims that this 1998 article involves the HPV vaccine, which did not exist until 2006.
* Alex’s Eleventh Headline doesn’t make his argument. There are two articles titled “Antifertility Vaccines” on Science Direct. One of them is just [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1471490602021828 the same article as his Second Headline], which he already cited when it was posted on a different website. The other is [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0264410X89900431 a 1989 article by Gursaran Talwar] about his research into birth control shots.
* Alex’s Twelfth Headline doesn’t make his argument. I think it’s something about ink cartridges making you sterile, but I have no idea what he’s talking about.
* Alex’s Thirteenth Headline doesn’t make his argument. It is just the original paper from the Open Access Library Journal that started all of this.
* Alex’s Fourteenth Headline doesn’t make his argument. It is [https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/news/ethical-questions-surround-vaccine-reduce-fertility an op-ed in the Sunday Guardian] which miscites an [https://www.nature.com/articles/nm0218-118 article in Nature Medicine] about Gursaran Talwar’s continuing research into birth control shots, even though he was older than 90.
* Alex’s argument about Globalists putting sterilants into the vaccines has not been made in any way, this was a complete failure on his part.
* Alex’s guest, Rich Granville, [https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/08/michael-flynn-and-george-papadopoulos-are-scheduled-to-speak-at-a-conference-organized-by-a-qanon-supporter/ organized a very-clearly QAnon themed conference], then [https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/08/michael-flynn-wants-a-judge-to-allow-him-to-travel-to-a-conference-held-by-a-qanon-fan/ got mad at Mother Jones for calling it that].

</div></div></div></div></div></div>","Dan and Jordan begin an exploration of how Bill Cooper covered the bombing of the Murrah building in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995.

Topics covered include:

* Bill Cooper is concerned about a bill supposedly going through the Minnesota legislature that would convene a Conference of States. There is [https://www.revisor.mn.gov/laws/1995/0/ no such bill] that appears to have passed the MN state house or senate in 1995. This was all about a plan being put together by the National Association of Governors to gather state legislatures to assert state power, but [https://www.riponsociety.org/article/the-unbridled-growth-of-federal-power-and-the-complacency-of-the-states/ the idea had been largely deflated] after the GOP won control of Congress in the 1994 midterms. It lingered as a paranoia among [https://www.phyllisschlafly.com/constitution/article-v-convention/the-phyllis-schlafly-report-april-1995/ folks like Phyllis Schlafly] after this point, however.
* Bill is upset about death estimates going around in the media. It’s unclear what exactly he was referring to, but [https://www.upi.com/Archives/1995/04/19/Bomb-tears-apart-Oklahoma-City-federal- UPI’s reporting] reflects responsible coverage. Bill appears to be talking about estimates from Washington by 4:30, which was when Bill Clinton and Janet Reno held a press conference. No estimates matching Bill’s version was [https://www.c-span.org/video/?64650-1%2Foklahoma-city-bombing in the conference].
* Bill is correct that [https://bombing.newsok.com/bombing/article/1175328/?template=bombing%2Fmain 50 Penn Place in Oklahoma City was evacuated], as well as Penn Square Mall across the street. He is unclear about the subject, and it’s not suspicious.
* Times of various events are from the [http://murderpedia.org/male.M/images/m/mcveigh/docs/okcfr_App_F.pdf Document Management Team’s report].
* The anchors who discussed a phone call claiming that the Nation of Islam took responsibility for the bombing also [https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-04-21-ca-57299-story.html were clear it could have been a prank call]. Also, Dave McCurdy [https://www.upi.com/Archives/1995/04/19/Bomb-tears-apart-Oklahoma-City-federal-building/9530023433931/ made reference to Hamas].
* The ATF [https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1996/05/06/after-the-bombing-an-ostracized-atf/55f5f973-5a92-423b-8deb-8498dff417c7/ has gone on the record] that there were no explosives in their office. Mike Shannon testified that one of the devices that was suspected to have been found [https://oklahoman.com/article/1074860/okc-bombing-trial-transcript-05211997-1631-cdtcst was a desk clock].
* There was [https://web.archive.org/web/20090511115014/http://www.terrorisminfo.mipt.org/pdf/okcfr_part2.pdf a rocket launcher found in the debris]. It was not hidden, nor unexplained.
* The Medallion Hotel does exist. It started a renovation project [https://www.questia.com/newspaper/1P2-5676129/medallion-hotel-slated-for-renovation-project in Feb. 1995], and completed it [https://oklahoman.com/article/2553209/medallion-hotel-shows-off-plush-renovation in October 1996].

* Bill claims that an April 20 bombing in Prince Edward Island was connected with the OKC bombing. This is definitely not true. It was the work of [https://www.theguardian.pe.ca/news/local/convicted-bomber-roger-bells-reign-of-terror-began-30-years-ago-251945/ a serial bomber named Roger Charles Bell], who [https://www.theguardian.pe.ca/news/local/how-loki-7-bomber-roger-bell-became-a-police-task-forces-top-priority-251954/ taunted the police] under the alias, Loki 7.
* The Omnibus Counterterrorism Act of 1995 [https://www.congress.gov/bill/104th-congress/senate-bill/00390 did not pass the Senate] as S390. It also [https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/104/s761 did not pass when it was introduced again] as S761.

* Alex lies about [https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/soil-depletion-and-nutrition-loss/ an article in Scientific American] about soil depletion. The short version of this is that scientists have studied soil depletion, and they initially believed that it was likely the result of non-organic agricultural practices. Subsequent research has shown that [https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/vanishing-nutrients/ it is more likely that the phenomenon is related to climate change], and that vitamin/mineral depletion is connected to increased levels of CO2.
* Alex insults Caitlin Upton, the woman who competed at the 2007 Miss Teen USA pageant and had a bad answer about education. Two people who Alex loves in 2020 were big fans of Ms. Upton.

* Alex talks to Anthony Guciardi, who is basically just there to do an infomercial for Alex’s supplement line.
* Alex interviews the guy who owns the radio station that airs his show in the Chicago area.
* Alex interviews Larry Klayman, who would go on to sue Alex in 2019.

Topics covered include:

* Millie Weaver and her husband Gavin Wince [https://heavy.com/news/2020/08/millie-weaver/ were arrested on August 14], on felony charges of burglary, tampering with evidence, obstruction of justice, and domestic violence.
* Millie claims that government contractors are not subject to FOIA requests. [https://washingtontechnology.com/articles/2017/02/17/insights-proxmire-foia-advice.aspx This is not true]. You can find all sorts of information about government contractors on [https://foiaonline.gov/foiaonline/action/public/home the FOIA portal].
* One of Millie’s experts, Patrick Bergy alleges to be [https://www.tampabay.com/archive/2005/10/27/bound-for-boot-camp-he-s-booted-from-his-job/ the first 40 year old private in the US military]. He also ran for [https://www.tampabay.com/archive/2004/10/11/independent-candidate-strives-to-be-heard/ Pasco County Election Supervisor], which [https://www.pascovotes.gov/portals/pasco/Results/gen04all.htm did not result in a victory].

* Patrick Bergy’s story largely relies on appeals to stories about IIA, or Interactive Internet Activity. The primary source about this is [https://fas.org/sgp/othergov/dod/dod060807.pdf a 2007 memo] which discusses public relations guidelines for interactive internet engagement of DoD personnel in certain foreign countries. It does not appear to be anything close to what they claim.
* Patrick Bergy wrote a book called [https://www.amazon.com/Victim-Swamp-State-Destroyed-Private/dp/1977646468 Victim Of The Swamp].

* Millie says that upstream collection of data is a large part of what the NSA does, but this is not accurate. A 2011 report found that [https://www.aclu.org/files/assets/fisc_opinion_10.3.2011.pdf 9% of internet data collected] was upstream collection, as opposed to stuff acquired directly from ISPs. Also, the NSA reported that they [https://www.nsa.gov/news-features/press-room/Article/1618699/nsa-stops-certain-section-702-upstream-activities/ amended their upstream collection practices] in April 2017.
* The [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/22/us/politics/22passport.html 2008 passport data breach] involved contractors from [https://web.archive.org/web/20080324040415/http://deepbackground.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/03/21/794799.aspx Stanley Inc and The Analysis Group]. It did not involve CGI, although [https://washingtontechnology.com/articles/2010/05/07/cgi-buys-stanley.aspx CGI did acquire Stanley in 2010], two years later.
* The Analysis Corporation is a [https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/The_Analysis_Corporation wholly-owned subsidiary of Global Strategies Group].
* Millie thinks that CGI stands for Canadian Global Information, because those words are in the first line of their Wikipedia page. The name actually stands for [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/10/16/meet-cgi-federal-the-company-behind-the-botched-launch-of-healthcare-gov/ Conseillers en Gestion et Informatique].
* The John Brennan quid-pro-quo theory does not make sense, given that [https://web.archive.org/web/20110507023129/http://www.northjersey.com/news/120509_North_Bergen_man_is_homeland_security_assistant_for_President_Obama.html he was a high level Obama advisor prior to the passport breach], and was clearly on a short-list to be in the administration.
* The PRISM program did not involve upstream collections of data.
* Dynology has received [https://www.usaspending.gov/#/search/b174b27784aef45c8a6b0640ee63792c many government contracts] over the years. [https://www.usaspending.gov/#/award/CONT_AWD_W912PE08P7083_9700_-NONE-_-NONE- One of these contracts] involves work that was performed in Germany, which Millie is claiming involves the Congressional Knowledge Management Service.

In cloud computing, CMKS is an abbreviation for Customer Master Keys, so it is entirely possible that this is what this contract was for, and there’s no evidence provided that it has anything to do with the Congressional Knowledge Management Service.
* Patrick Bergy asserts that the Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012 made it legal for the US government to propagandize the US population. This is [https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/07/14/u-s-repeals-propaganda-ban-spreads-government-made-news-to-americans/ a misunderstanding that apparently began with a sloppy column in Buzzfeed], which took on a life of its own.

* Patrick Bergy seems to think that every recent instance of non-white communities expressing dissatisfaction with things like police violence are examples of people being swayed by Department of Defense IIA operations. The documentary doesn’t include instances of white identity protests being accused of being IIA, which is weird.
* Patrick Bergy’s story seems to [https://www.victimoftheswamp.com/2020/02/22/the-witness-obamas-shadownet/ include a whole lot of instances] of him being rebuffed by prominent people, like Matt Gaetz and Dan Bongino, after he approaches them about ShadowNet. The fact that they won’t sign onto his conspiracy theory seems to consistently be taken as evidence that they themselves are involved in the ShadowNet conspiracy.
* Millie’s other expert, Tore, [https://www.infowars.com/breaking-new-evidence-confirms-kentucky-election-fraud/ was also Millie’s primary source] for her “reporting” about questions surrounding the 2019 election in Kentucky.
* Tore’s [https://www.propublica.org/article/misinformation-efforts-over-kentucky-vote-could-be-playbook-for-2020 full name is Terpsichore Lindeman], and her claims about voter roll discrepancy were debunked by ProPublica.
* Tore was [https://attorneygeneral.nd.gov/news/attorney-general-details-investigation-unlicensed-business-alleged-fraud-tore-maras-lindeman investigated by the North Dakota attorney general] for inappropriately soliciting charitable donations in 2018. She also decided to [https://www.kfyrtv.com/content/news/Second-candidate-running-in-Minot-mayoral-race-468072953.html run for mayor of Minot, North Dakota] on a platform of Make Minot Great Again. [https://www.minotdailynews.com/news/local-news/2018/06/election-results-upheld-in-official-tally/ She did not make it to the ballot]. Fellow citizens started [https://www.change.org/p/concerned-citizens-of-minot-prohibit-tore-maras-lindeman-from-running-for-mayor-in-minot-nd a Change.org petition] to stop her from running for mayor.
* In 2011, Tore is listed as an undergraduate student in biology at the University of Kentucky, in the [https://www.uky.edu/chellgren/sites/www.uky.edu.chellgren/files/FINAL%20ABSTRACT%20BOOK.pdf program for their Showcase of Undergraduate Scholars].
* However, [https://medium.com/immigration-policy/usa-language-confidential-8aec1c253d96 according to her own Medium page], she claims that she was in medical school in 2008. In Millie’s documentary, she also claims that she was working on secret projects for John Brennan in 2008, which seems like a problem. [https://navy.togetherweserved.com/usn/servlet/tws.webapp.WebApp?ID=506419&cmd=ShadowBoxProfile&type=Person Her page on TogetherWeServed] also claims to have been attending the University of Kentucky in 2008.
* [https://medium.com/@drlindeman Tore’s Medium page] was largely about issues related to foreign language interpreting and serving immigrant communities, until August 2016, when the tone completely changed and it became a very intense conspiracy, pro-Trump blog. Even as her writing shifted into being about the evil forces conspiring about Trump, she did not claim to have first-hand knowledge of these evil forces, which she does claim now, which seems weird.
* Robert Storch was [https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/president-donald-j-trump-announces-key-additions-administration-2/ re-nominated by Trump in June 2017]. In December, [https://www.nsa.gov/news-features/press-room/Article/1618765/robert-storch-confirmed-as-national-security-agency-inspector-general/ he was confirmed by the Senate] as the Inspector General of the NSA. Millie says that it “appears he was never actually confirmed,” which makes no sense.
* Paul Manafort was not the only [https://www.thedailybeast.com/rick-gates-tells-mueller-about-trump-teams-dealings-with-israeli-intelligence-firm Trump campaign connection to Psy-Group].
* Shawn Lucas was in a video serving papers to the DNC, but he was [https://heavy.com/news/2016/11/shawn-lucas-cause-of-death-drugs-released-kratom-fentanyl-dnc-process-server-democratic-national-committee-hillary-clinton-conspiracy-theory-theories-seth-rich/ just employed as a process server]. It was not his lawsuit. Though tragic, the claim that his death was suspicious or a murder has not been substantiated at all.
* Trump did not make it so people lose their security clearances when they leave their jobs. Because of [https://clearedjobs.net/security-clearance-faqs how clearances work], this would be a logistical and administrative nightmare and create so much more bureaucracy.
* Millie read the first paragraph of [https://www.europarl.europa.eu/cmsdata/196207/UNICRI%20-%20Artificial%20intelligence%20and%20robotics%20for%20law%20enforcement.pdf an Interpol report] about robotics and law enforcement and reported on it. She neglects to mention any of the relevant content of the report.

Topics covered include:

* Alex has seen some viral videos purporting to show that wearing masks raises CO2 levels you’re breathing to dangerous levels. This [https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/masks-dangerous-health/ has been debunked], and is kind of silly even just at face value. If wearing a mask for a short period of time had any legitimate health risks, there would be many activities that would be nearly impossible, like motorcycle trips or skiing.
* Alex rewrites the story of the noose that was found at Bubba Wallace’s NASCAR garage in order to turn it into a story of a racism-hoax. His details of the story are inaccurate.
* Alex hand-waives the rising cases of Covid-19 in the US because there are not also sharply increasing death numbers. This does not take into account that deaths are a lagging indicator when it comes to health emergencies. Typically death numbers do not rise immediately, it takes a while after case numbers rise.
* Alex says that his enemies need to “go on helicopter rides,” which is a reference to the way Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet would kill his political rivals. Pinochet has become a bit of a hero of the current fascist right-wing, mostly because they know they can’t get away with wearing shirts that say “Hitler Did Nothing Wrong.”
* Alex thinks that Hillary Clinton and Obama are going to run for president and vice president in the 2020 election. It is too late for them to run within the Democratic party, and it seems entirely unbelievable to think they’d run third party. Alex is kind of just making stuff up.
* Alex claims that Black Lives Matter wants to destroy the nuclear family. This is just an intentional misrepresentation of [https://www.mediamatters.org/black-lives-matter/right-wing-media-claim-black-lives-matter-advocates-against-family-through their actual position]. If you read their statement of beliefs, it’s clear that it’s about viewing each other as family, regardless of blood relation, not about destroying any family structure. They’re also very explicit about respecting parental relations, which upholds familial structures.
* Alex and his guest, Rev. Childress, discuss how Martin Luther King Jr. was against riots.

It’s a longstanding tradition to shame protesters for not being saintly enough to have their concerns heard, and this is just Alex’s racist version of it.
* Alex and Childress lie about the relationship between Hitler and Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger.

* Alex incorrectly reports that the CDC says that masks don’t work at all. He claims that they admit that you wearing a mask will not stop you from spreading the virus, if you’re sick. In reality, [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html the page he’s found on the CDC website] is about masks with valves, which most everyday masks do not have. This story is a dud. You can find [https://www.insider.com/masks-with-a-breathable-valve-are-useless-experts-warn-2020-5 tons of stories] from [https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-8266171/Bay-Area-says-masks-valves-not-acceptable-face-protection-amid-coronavirus-pandemic.html back in April] and [https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/05/27/nation/wearing-face-mask-with-valve-it-might-be-time-find-something-else-some-experts-say/ May about how] [https://www.fastcompany.com/90496717/what-is-a-mask-valve-and-why-are-cities-banning-them masks with valves are not effective] at stopping viral transmission.
* Alex has started a website called We Can’t Breathe, attempting to hijack the police brutality movement and use it against masks. It’s pathetic, racist, and also doesn’t seem to be working. Anyway, [https://www.statesman.com/news/20200627/adler-austin-has-nationrsquos-highest-7-day-metro-positivity-rate-of-coronavirus-tests?fbclid=IwAR3eVRaU0q5ar41HreYzSjKRrLTQP_pi8Df5mfqOQUHa_fdp_ssduAK9d5Q&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=web_push cases of Covid-19 in Austin are exploding], so this is a really bad idea.
* Alex tries to interview his anti-communist hero G. Edward Griffin, but unfortunately Griffin is not really all that into Trump. Because Alex is a coward and can’t argue with someone with as high of stature as Griffin, and because Griffin doesn’t give a shit about Alex’s scam, this leads to Alex suggesting that the Globalists actually wanted Trump to get elected to negotiate a better position with China. He will absolutely forget about this and never bring it up again.

</div></div></div></div></div></div>","What follows are the resources that were used as reference in our coverage of Alex Jones’ 2009 “documentary” The Obama Deception.

On a fundamental level, most of the worldview that is expressed by Alex Jones’ voice-over, and that of his main “expert” Webster Tarpley is traceable to W. Cleon Skousen’s 1970 book The Naked Capitalist. That book was a complete misrepresentation of Carroll Quigley’s work, particularly his books The Tragedy of Hope, and The Anglo-American Establishment. If you would like to hear Quigley’s take on Skousen’s work, and how he trafficked in misrepresentations, [http://www.carrollquigley.net/pdf/Round%20Table%20Review.pdf you can find a basic example here].

This explains a good deal of the historical revisionism in the film, so it felt appropriate to bring that up at the start.

Topics covered include:

* Michael Savage is not a medical doctor. [http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/3287378 His dissertation] was about plants in Fiji.
* Alex claims that there is a normal number of deaths happening right now. This is not true, and it is very clearly laid out [https://www.ft.com/content/a26fbf7e-48f8-11ea-aeb3-955839e06441 by the Financial Times].
* Alex claims that there were a bunch of scandals in the 1990’s about doctors killing patients to steal their organs. He appears to be misremembering a bit of debate about organ donation guidelines that was covered [https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/13/us/controversy-erupts-over-organ-removals.html by the New York Times] in 1997.
* Alex and David Knight pretend that the inevitable additional cases of coronavirus and deaths that come after states open up prematurely are proof of some kind of conspiracy. In reality, they will be the expected thing that happens, [https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/23/asia/hong-kong-coronavirus-quarantine-intl-hnk/index.html as it did in Hong Kong], as well as elsewhere.
* Alex lies about the antibody tests that we have for Covid-19. [https://www.discovermagazine.com/health/covid-19-antibody-testing-tougher-than-true-false They aren’t perfectly accurate at this point], but his narratives about them turning up positive if you had a cold in the past decade is complete nonsense.

* The US and UK did release [https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/apt-groups-target-healthcare-essential-services-advisory an advisory warning about hacking], but they did not specify that they were Chinese hackers, as Alex is reporting. They just say they are Advanced Persistent Threat Groups of hackers, which is not country specific.
* Alex’s story from the “Financial Telegraph” is actually from the “[https://www.businesslive.co.za/fm/features/2020-05-05-lockdown-disaster-dwarfs-covid-19-say-sa-actuaries/ Financial Mail].” It discusses the effects of the virus outbreak vs. the effects of the lockdown, as it relates to South Africa, but it paints a pretty different picture than Alex paints.
* Alex is correct that Marie Antoinette didn’t actually say “let them eat cake,” but his theories about who actually did [https://www.britannica.com/story/did-marie-antoinette-really-say-let-them-eat-cake are not supported by historians].
* Alex’s complaints about Marie Antoinette playing badminton while her people starved is way too much of a parallel with Trump [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/04/17/fact-check-trump-had-rallies-golfed-covid-19-outbreak-grew/5126918002/ going golfing frequently during the pandemic]
